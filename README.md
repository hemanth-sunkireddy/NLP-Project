## Intent Mapping NLP Pipeline

| **Intent Code**     | **Use Sentiment Analysis?** | **Use Summarization or NLG?** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `yes_no`            | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No (direct Yes/No + sentiment-based answer) |
| `instructor`        | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ NLG (generate opinion-style sentence) |
| `content`           | ❌ No                       | ✅ Summarization (highlight topics) |
| `difficulty`        | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ NLG (generate difficulty opinion summary) |
| `career`            | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ NLG (generate relevance to job) |
| `comparison`        | ✅ Yes (if needed)          | ✅ NLG (contrastive generation using review pairs) |
| `general_opinion`   | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ Summarization or NLG (opinion summary) |
| `course_overview`   | ❌ No                       | ✅ Summarization (extractive/abstractive overview) |
