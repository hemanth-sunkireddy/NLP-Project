This is purely subjective, but I could not keep myself awake and sustain interest long enough to finish the one section I paid for. I guess I should have tried one for free first...I tried to tell the Coursera staff to remove the course from my list and that I did not need my refund, but sadly, it sits on my 'enrolled courses' list, perhaps permanently until I cancel my account. Luckily, I did figure out how to turn off the almost twice daily notifications.
This class is taught a terrible pace and is very old-school in it's thinking. It was pretty painful to get through actually
It said I could earn a certificate of completion... I paid and all and didn't get anything! I'm really disapointed.
Lot of Improvement required, Sorry to say, but nevertheless Youtube videos are better than the course content
Very through introduction course, very helpful for those who are preparing for PMP exam .
Please, I wish to change to Project Management Project Instead.
The quizes ask you questions based on non-required books.
The question patterns should be hard
boring. did not learn much
No factual tools !
I think there is a major thing that wasn't planned good. There has  never been an available option of downloading the lessons of the  Introduction to Project Management in a PowePoint/PDF document.Printing these lessons page by page takes a lot of time and moreover is a terrible waste of paper and trees!!! Even if I would like to save it in a electronic version I would have to save it page by page, for which I don't have time! This is ridiculous, sorrySincerely, Anna Wolska, MSc, PhD
I found this course disappointing. Whilst the presenter, Margaret Meloni, was enthusiastic and pleasant to listen to, the content was very sparse indeed. A large part of the content each week was simply reading a presentation which you could get from a book. I would expect an online course to be more interactive, have more videos, and more varied content. I found the case studies (where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision) useful - there was one of these per week when I think there could have been more, perhaps three a week. The course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments. This would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them.
The course used a lot of words to explain very imple topics without drawing on any real world examples and so the concept of a "project" was broadly oversimplified. Presumably to appeal to a wider number of people, but in the end it just seemed to be evangelising the PMI/PMBOK for the sake of it.I haven't got to the end of the course yet but my enthusiasm to do so dwindled very quickly.This may be a regional thing but I have never heard the word"processes" spoken as by the lady in the video. I found it difficult to concentrate on what she was saying as a result.
There are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies. Slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value. The course is not compelling in any way. Too many references to a book said to be not compulsory.In the final exam right answers are not given. The course gives you just a smattering of the subject, nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job.
I felt the initial splash screen was a bit time consuming, also lot of the knowledge felt like more bookish. Could have been different styles of management and approaches or even how leaders in the past like Dale Carneige would have approached. This course has a lot of potential and I feel revising the next version would make it so much better for novice program managers
I like the case study videos in all of the weeks. They seem like scenarios which everyone would come across at any given point of time. But I wish there was more of video content than reading content. I pushed myself real hard to read the content. Would've preferred to have the lecturer explain all of that instead of having it all handed over in the written format.
The flash tutorials are helpful. Instructor quality is low, production quality of instructor videos is low. Not on par with the University of Virginia project management course. Pace of course is also extremely slow, though it may be appropriate for novice students. That should be made clear up-front in the course description.
Wish I'd been told before starting how much content relied on having the PMBOK book. Lack of linear structure to the planning process was quite confusing. The teaching seemed to flit back and forward the process. Left a litte confused about the correct order to tackle things in.
well organized course, teach you the basics of project management.Rated 2 stars: no point in paying if you don't have any course material, like downloadable presentation, which are crucial if you want to review what you've studied.
Good as overview, but pretty shallow. Only some slides to read through, no real exercises but constant reference to the standard project management book. Pretty fast click-through as start into project management.
The course is not interactive enough, it's a waterfall of dry information. I'd expected more based on the generally good reviews. Say, more examples, better videos. Think twice before buying.
It's for the young worker who just starts to work in the office.  The lesson may be too simple for the experienced officer
Despite having high quality contents, the quantity wasn't as much as I expected. The number of videos could be a lot more.
Some good concepts and stories, but lacking in specific techniques.
It should be alligned with PMBOK 6th Edition
Not interactive enough.
It was just theory!
Very Boring
Following are the scope of improvement - 1) The flash lessons could have been provided in some kind of downloadable format (preferably PDF)2) Actual examples of Project Charter and Project Management Plan could have been provided. This would have made it easier to relate theory (of this course) with (actual) practice.
Very small amount of video lectures, it's a self-learning EDU track, which is okay to a certain extent, but you turn out to be not that involved when there is only 8 mins of video-lecturing per week and everything else is read and study by yourself. More explanations, more real-life examples needed. Also, PMP-book "promotion" was mentioned too often. But overall course was good.
The course is really interesting but has two main downsides.First, half of all lessons is about reading a book that we should buy in addition to the course. I already bought the course so it feels just wrong.Secondly, the slides are quite interesting and complete but the fact that we can't print them to read them offline is odd.
Good coursethank you
Could be in much greater depth.  Loved the video lectures: more please!  Perhaps a second video lecture per week that delves into greater detail, so that the level of discussion is more in line with the PMBOK.  The quizzes were simplistic, which is fine, but the final was literally just questions from the quizzes pasted together (all were repeats!)  This sad fact undermines the integrity of the final as an actual test of ability and comprehension.
The course, as intended probably, is theoretical and gives a good snapshot of project management. Following the PMBOK guide and covering all the relevant portions in the limited time deserves an applause. The only area of improvement, I felt, was the case study.It could have been a little more detailed and has scope of increased level of difficulty. A good course overall and beneficial in almost all walks of work :) Thank you !
A bit confusing in term of structure. We jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others. It gave a good general picture of what project management is about. But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project. However I have to say I didn't do the optional readings. At least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me
I have often wondered if it would be worth it to get a PMP certificate but after taking this class I am thinking not so much. Not a criticism of the curriculum, but as someone who has 20+ years in the creative field it's not apples to apples. The terminology is similar enough but still quite different. For a new person starting out in a non-creative environment this is good introduction to the general concepts on PM.
I watched the entire set of week one lectures, and sadly I do not think this is up to scratch with the rest of the material on Coursera.  The presentation is not consistent: there are slides, web cam videos, animations, and it just feels like the course is a mish mash. The University of Adelaide is running a similar course on a well known competitor site, so I have signed up to that.
Material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative. It gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense. You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of "cue cards" so it's a little flat. For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.
I like the materials, but I don't like that you need to pay to take the quizzes. I think that it is against the spirit of Coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but don't have enough money to pay for the course. Many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying
I think extra knowledge is needed cause while studying from the PMBOK, i found that 10% of the topic is being lectured and the other 90% are to be self-studied and technically 30% of not self-explained so more time is wasted in looking up for info that were not in the lecture if you know what i mean.
I wish the course had more examples taken from real project. It would be useful to consider more meaningful case studies and to analyze their actual documents and deliverables.One last thing, reading the slides through the website instead that having pdf to download and read was really annoying.
I learn more from this course such as how mange project, how I understood concepts key elements of project,  the performance cost work. Finally, Thank very much to all instructors or anyone contributes in preparing this course to content all these information that really gain more to background
the processes explained in the PMBOK Guide are very dense and neither white or black but grey. It is important so ilustrate with little examples in order to be able to understand the processes, documentation, deliverables and tools of each of the 10 knowledge areas of Project Management
The course is great resource of information. The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture. This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I "attend" Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.
I really liked the case studys, the bonus videos and the panelist interview at the end of the course. This course is a good opportunity to gain basic knowledge about project management but I think the videos were too short and the majority of the course consists of reading.
I thought this course had a lot of great information, but I didn't like the order it was shared in. I felt like it jumped around a bit and did not give a clear picture of the correct timeline and steps I should be taking, when initiating and starting a project.
Really nice but a little complex for people who just want to learn the basics.  This would be very helpful for current college students as the course includes optional readings that are very informative and helpful for a deeper understanding.
Too much PMBok & PMI methodology promotion - it is indeed well structured, however looks artificially overcomplicated. Final exam is almost 100% consists from quizzes; additional reading only available through books you need to buy
The speed of speaker is really fast which may not be suitable for those whose English is not their native language. I had to listen at least twice to understand what was taught. The course is otherwise well structured and clear
The course went through too many concepts too fast without providing enough scenarios for better grasp of application. I also expected templates for various artefacts mentioned in the course, but they did not include any.
Some useful stuff in there, but a lot of unnecessary jargon, and the way of testing does not stimulate learning: it's often literally copy-pasting things from the readings, rather than testing underlying understanding.
It gives a good overview of the subject but still can be much better adding more subjects to the content and case studies for review. A forum would add value to the course by discussing with others about the subject.
I would like to see the more practical information. The course is 90% built on PMBOK. I can read this guide on my own outside the course. In the course, I prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory.
I wish there were more practical cases than just PMBook in online version. I doubt that anyone of an entry level needs all those endless theory lessons to get the grasp of what project management is about.
The content balance of the course feels very stretched thin over the 5 weeks. Regular, concentrated study could see an average student complete this course in a matter of days if not less.
The course contained some valuable information, but the lack of projects even small ones didn't help much. I would prefer a small project/assignment during the last week of the course.
It isn't as engaging as I thought it would be. Since this is an introductory course, it would have helped if this were more interactive to build the interest for the latter courses.
the information is presented well, but not in an engaging manner, I would describe the course as mono-tone.  I would have abandoned the course but I needed the certification.
sharing the experience was a great initiative but the links for reading is not working on google chrome or internet explorer, also I couldn't find the presentation materials.
I realize this course isn't expensive but it relies too heavily on the PMBOK without actually discussing it. I'd be happier with the course if the PMBOK had been left out.
I think the discussion on initiating and planning projects could be improved to be a bit more comprehensive and It would be great if the lecture slides were downloadable.
A nice intro course into what is a project and who is involved in a project. Some of the lecture material did not match the paired video which led to some confusion.
The Modules which were in the form of HTML files should have been in the form of lectures which would make them more understandable than reading for oneself.
The course is quite alright. The videos were too long and had too many messages in just one video. Nevertheless, I learnt how to be a better project manager
It's a good course, if you're looking to learn the basics of planning projects, and it doesn't take more than a day to complete, it's just a bit of reading.
Informative and clearly structured course. However, its content is aimed at professional project managers - useful but not exactly what I was looking for !
I suggest update content media and incorporate material to create a toolkit for students. Benchmark vs. Linkedin learn PM course which I consider great.
Reading materials were detailed but can cause information overload if the presentations are to be presented alone without discussion of instructor
Content is good and qualitative. But lack of real assignments beyond quiz, applying this knowledge to use case, and having peer reviews for it.
Please add exercise for a real-life project scenario that I can work on. This course has many pieces of information but no practice.
This is great. The manner in which so much details are compressed in a few lessons running over a short duration is impressive.
It is a good course for beginners. The exercises that include imagining could be changed with something else more proactive.
Pros: Very clear explanations, useful slides for PMP preparation.Cons: Very easy questions and exams. Not challenging at all
This course enhanced my knowledge about initiating a project and how to plan it and get success in your projects
Although I understand it was a beginners course, it was far too easy. I finished the entire course in 3/4 hours.
Good course for novices. Not enough new stuff for people have some experience in projects, formally, informally.
I would have liked to had more relevant examples of how to apply the concepts learned to real life scenarios.
Course can be further detailed and digged dipper to understand the concepts explained in the video lectures.
The exercises should have examples which we can solve because as students we don't  have many to work with.
The pattern of the course was too repetitive. There was not detailed feedback on the questions of the quiz.
It is a very good introduction to Project Management, but very simple. I would say only for very begginers.
test questions far too easyslide show lessons not well structured and too focussed on repetetive concepts
The lessons were really informative, however, I wish the structure of the lessons were more organized
If you're right brained it's very hard to get and stay into.  That said, the information was helpful.
Video lectures contains too many definitions requiring too much to pause while viewing the video.
The conecepts are difficult to understand because of the difficult language used in the course.
It helps get your feet wet. Also, I like the professor. She's enthusiastic about the material.
the assesments were not very helpful in testing your knowledge, you could add more examples.
Good way to refresh your knowledge about PMP .. but not qualifying as a professional course
It's just theoretical. We didn't get a change to apply the planning process and so on.
Good course, easy to follow. Stayed away from complicated, deep-dives of information
Useful if you want to take PMP exam, beginner info about PM, but not very deep.
Real live scenarios of running a project would add a great deal to the course.
I have no background in project management an even I found it too elementary.
this is very described and detailed information and lessons, good examples.
I did not enjoy this as much as the first course. Still interesting though!
Very high level course, gives a few hints on the main concepts of PMI
The content is good but the quiz and final exam are way too easy...
The site is not very user friendly. The information is good though.
Initiating and Planning Projects is a good course and I like it.
Covers basic understanding for Initiating and Planning Projects.
Too easy to pass! But thanx for your time devoted to the course.
Just a format introduction to Project management, but good one.
Need to me more technical. It was covering very basic concepts
A little too easy - can easily be done within 2 hours...
I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.
Very interesting!!!Let me go ahead with more courses
more practical projects&homework would be great!
It should include some assignments or projects.
The course is very basic. Almost common sense.
Good if you know nothing of project management
Very informative, and easy to follow format.
that's ok to who know less or nothing !
This was a good series for beginners.
The course is just okay.
The course was helpful.
Good for the beginners
Not enough exmaples
Well structured course, great presenter, really interesting materials, overall the whole 3 Part course is well worth doing. The bonus videos that the presenter does on real life examples are excellent and I've watched some of them multiple times. The course is useful not only aa good introduction to PM tools and techniques but also to reinforce what the role of the project manager actually is.
I hope there can be more examples and practise in real cases we can do so that use all these theories.
Very useful to start project management role with the right tools
Comprehensive start to understand PM concepts
If you're looking to brush up or learn some project management fundamentals and learn a little about the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), then I recommend this course for you.  If you already have some experience and confidence as a project manager, then this course may be too fundamental for you.  This course covers a lot of the material from the "initiating" and "planning" stages of the PMBOK guide.  There's also a good section on authority vs. influencing and managing conflict.  The professor is great.  I would be interested in some more involved exercises or projects though, as the exercises are more so just a reflection question accompanying each week's lesson.  The class may be significantly enhanced by the optional reading, but, having not purchased those books, I can't say.
The course is well prepared, thought through, coherent and structured in a way that it supports the content. However, it felt very much like being in an advertisement program for PMBOK. This feeling was supported by the unavailability of all course materials.Throughout the course the PMBOK guide was included as the suggested reading. The PMBOK materials were featured in each and every lecture and the guidebook was extensively presented and recommended in an extra video. This gives the impression that the course content cannot be sufficiently understood without this literature. Therefore, I would expect the specific recommend chapters to be made available for the participants of the course, especially since this is a paid course.
This course packed a lot in and was very direct and efficient, giving helpful examples to illustrate the points. The project management tools learned can be applied in so many situations even for those of us who will never have the official title of "project manager". Videos are supplemented by flash lessons that go over the information, which was great for learners who may not learn as well by video alone. I would have liked one or two written assignments, but quizzes were relevant to the information provided and it was nice not to have to wait on peer-reviews. Overall, a great course.
That was really good and useful for me. The lector is great and the 'homework' really deep. But here are 2 problems for me:1. For me (I'm not a native Englishman) "homework" were not a 10-minutes light walk. I'm not against long and hard working, but I still think that the time which shown as "normal" for doing this work isn't truly and honestly make. 2. That was disappointing to see the last final exam in form of compilation of previous. That upset me a bit and make this course easier as I think.But summary the course worth this time and cost.
All information is relevant and useful. However, there are two points I would like mention.1-The lecture part should be more dynamic because it contains a lot of definitions and data. I find it really hard to focus in all that content; I needed to take many notes and sometimes re-read pages in order to get and understand what it is explained.2-The activity part where you have to think about your actual projects, should be checked by a tutor or someone who can tell you if your assessment is correct, I think this is part of the learning curve.
Good introduction to project management basics. Deals with the definition of a project and introduces the student to a set of formal ways to document things to consider when starting a project, e.g. scope, stakeholders and responsibility assignments. It is on times a little bit too theoretical for my taste. There are some small case study videos that are well done. Could be a little bit more hands-on.I still enjoyed it, learned a lot and will continue with the second course in this series.
Russian language is stated but some videos do not have subtitles in Russian. And the presentation is copy-protected, so it can't be translated into your own language either. It is also very difficult to find the theoretical materials on which the course is based in an online format in your own language. In General, the course is interesting and very practice-oriented, but training videos alone are not enough, you need to study theory.
Overall, the course was good. It offered recorded sessions, examples, case studies, control questions during lessons, and a summary of key principles as extracted from the PMBOK guide. However, it could benefit from having more of the former four items, which should satisfy the need for explanations and application of knowledge. The final exam had some questions repeating from previous quizzes, which can also be avoided.
I like the teacher a lot, I think she speaks very clearly and is very animated. The video/content is very fast though, which doesn't allow a lot of time to take notes. I feel the videos should give a high level overview of the reading, but I noticed that the readings sometime have a lot of important topics that the videos does not mention at all, so it's really important to read the accompanying materials carefully.
I feel so blessed that I was able to complete my first online course and achieving such certifcate. I am looking forward to completing my certificate and building a professional career. I reviewed the course with 4 stars as I think that the reading parts were a bit boring and confusing despite what it has as a variety of information. I am looking forward to finding a simplier yet an informative reading articles.
I liked everything about this course except that some of the lesson materials couldn't be viewed on my iPad as they were flash based. Other than that, the videos were good - not too long, not too short - and the quizzes were suitably based on what was discussed beforehand in the lectures and lessons. I also picked up one of the recommended readings "Fast Forward MBA in Project Management" which I also liked.
The course is great but can't give 5 stars because the times for completion are lazily derived.  For instance, every lesson that has slides is allocated 10 minutes, but some may contain 40 slides, meaning you only get 15 seconds for each slide!  There's no way!!!People learning online are often very schedule sensitive so it would be good to at least use accurate estimates of time required.
Very great course offering the basic introduction to project management that anyone can easily understand even if they have no experience!  The lectures were very useful and were supplemented with case studies and other interactive lessons.  I just wish there were assignments attached to the course rather than just using quizzes to check your understanding.  Very excellent course overall!
I like the videos and structure, but the assignments here are very weak--would be much more effective and useful to work with actual case studies. Simply asking us to 'think of some projects' makes it much more difficult to map the learnings to real-world problems. I'd strongly suggest using examples, like in the case study videos, so that we can really properly think it through.
Course goes over the most basic points, but also allows you (if you are interested) to dive much deeper into the content.  Seems it has everything any project manager would want, so definitely worth taking.  Would have wanted the questions to be a little more difficult and potentially more questions to help make sure the information was retained.  Overall a great course.
Since I have no other point of reference I gave this course 4 stars, but I really enjoyed it.  I like the layout of each course and the content.  The way it was presented made it easy to follow and understand and prepared you for the quiz and final at the end.I'm excited to complete the other courses in the Project Management program, in hopes of advancing my career.
I wouldn't mind having a concrete Project that will follow me from the start (week 1 - course 1) to the finish (week 6 - course 4), specially when it comes to the assignments (which could include quizes, "real life problems", brain storming and what not). I think that would definitely make the (whole) path of these 4 courses more interesting and more valuable.
While my job at a large software company is not a project management role per se, I could identify many of the concepts discussed in this lesson occurring right before my eyes each and every day.  This course could be helpful to anyone who is starting their ascent into a supervisory/managerial role or those asked to take charge of any project, large or small.
I just finished week 2 (of 6) and I feel like I am learning. I am taking this course because I am an entrepreneur and would like to acquire tools and techniques and explore processes that can help me manage my company's projects. Though we are a year in, this is a great guide for starting to rein in runaway work and control the processes of the organization.
Course content is well-structured and good references are given. What can be improved is that I want to see how these skills can be applied in real life situations. It'd be great if discussion session can be organized by Coursera, basically coordinate students to form discussion groups and meet at least once a week to discuss the topics covered that week.
Course gives a fantastic overview of initiating and planning phases of project management for those with little or no formal training in project management. The video lectures are excellent: very clear and concise. The flash slides, however, are not as good although still helpful. Revising them would help (especially the ones for the lesson on scope).
Course was good, but in the end I feel that I could have gained the same information if I just purchased the PMBOK Guide, and it would have been cheaper than taking this course.  Also, the flash lessons were really annoying, I would much prefer a PDF or something similar, so that I could more easily go back and review content.
I will give it 4 star not because lessons were bad or anything its just that there was more reading then visual/video explanations so thats what was down but over all it was a great experience.  Learn allot and most of the this were new to me and was an amazing experience thanks UC irvine and thanks coresera.
The course was well designed and its pace was quite good in order to to grasp the basic and deep understanding. It also includes real life case studies creating different scenarios.  At-last but not least  it broaden my horizons and give more confidence in order to solve the real life business problems.
Excellent introductory course to project mgmt. Could use some clarification/streamlining on the terminology vs test questions throughout. (subject matter does not discuss "scope"; but test does have questions surrounding it).  Overall I did end up learning a lot and looking forward to the next course!!
Hi UCI  Master's ,In the way of Presenting the teaching is Amazing and its very easy to understand the language with classic case study to review the Subject . This is really useful for me to scale up my Project management Skills to next level of thinking . Thanks & Regards, Parasuraman. Ramasamy
There does tend to feel like a big chunk of reading material but its not death by power point, the videos are good however the American PM gentleman at end bursts the bubble a little with his 'are you sure you want to be a PM' mentality, yes of course otherwise I would not be investing my time.
The course level was high with very detailed explanations in project terminology. The only one that could change in my opinion is that, at the bonus videos could be presented professionals with certain problems or situations that were encountered in their workplace and what actions they took.
Good, relevant information. My only reservation is the structure — the same phases are often revisited since the course arranged according to bodies of knowledge within the PMBOK. Wouldn't it make more sense to walk through the project from start to finish, i.e. using time as the main axis?
Learning was relevant to any project and put forward in a concise manner. The teachers used real life project management experiences to emphasize concepts and principles. I especially enjoyed the panel discussion with experienced project managers where they talked about their experiences.
Really enjoyed this class.  I am a very detailed note taker and there were a couple of instances that the information provided didn't match the quiz answers; i.e. The Triple Constraint.  Overall this is very convenient, good layout and I enjoyed the professor.  Ready for my next class!
Very nice course for PM starter, the ways and tricks presented in this course really gives you the tools required to start your project management learning journey. Great thanks to the tutor Ms. Margaret Meloni and defiantly to Coursera for giving me such nice opportunity for leaning.
Thank you Margaret for this course. It was great and I really enjoyed it. What I would maybe add as a point is the length of the video materials (longer), additionally, it would be great to have more videos included but still keep reading as backup information or refresh. Ekaterina
Although I had already some experience with project management I still learned a lot in this course. It really broke for me certain ambiguity I had from the theoretical education compared to the real work experience and my personal identification with the role of a project manager.
This was a great course, and I espesially liked the last bonus video. The creaters have grosely underestimateed how much time you are going to use on week 4 though (about scoping). For those of us who does these courses in our work time, that makes it really hard to plan the day.
Almost perfect. It would be perfect if more practical examples, as well as more tests (some of them were repetitive), will be added. Besides, open-end and/or case-solving questions, if added, would make learning and assessment during the course better. Thanks for the course.
this is a useful course, the only thing that is very upset is the lack of ability to translate text materials using Google Translate or other means, although the text can not be copied, which means that to master the course if you are not a native speaker is very difficult
It is a very good course who want to know about project management skills.It is introductory do not expect to learn many things. The course is very easy and introductory level. Before deciding a career or paid course doing this course can help in your decision making.
The course is very flexible and easy to understand. The instructor was amazing, but she should have contributed more to the course. The lessons are helpful, but the instructor excluded most of the topics from her lectures. The quizzes were easy but thoughtful.
Very good high-level intro to PMBOK-based project management. The UC Irvine classes are not particularly demanding, and won't by themselves prepare you to take the PMP exam, but they will give you a decent grounding in the terminology and principles involved.
I thought this was an excellent overview of project management. It didn't overwhelm with all the nuts and bolts of how to do this, but instead gave a general idea of what needs to be considered. I've already started using some of the tools presented at work.
Excellent introduction to Project Management. This course give definition to the field and provides foundational context for any level of practice. I especially appreciate the clean visual presentations and valuable bonuses provided by UCIrvine.
This course really covers the basics and the videos help organize and summarize a lot of the information. The readings and slides help provide even more information and they guide you to sites and other readings to learn even more on your own.
The lectures of the course are concise and well thought out. The provided text gives a lot of detail and examples of the concepts.  The real-world practice sections could really use some work, but otherwise, I really enjoyed this first Course.
The course was so easy to understand and the way it was taught was smoothing.Audio frequency needs to be little more audible. The quiz were so relevant to the questions studied under the course.Thanks for this Course and this Opportunity.
The Course is good for a beginner as it is easy to understand. The final test should be a little difficult. If possible the videos could be more elaborate. Instead of slides, Videos could be added to make it more interactive to learn
The course was very helpful for undersatnding basic concepts in project management, with interesting and insightful use cases. The pacing is excellent, lectures are just the right length to not get you overfluded with information.
Great, high-level overview of the project management process. The slideshows were easy to access and provided condensed and highly relevant information. The platform was well used, and I appreciated the flexibility of the format.
I loved that the course was short and sweet and provided a quick overview to PMP, PMBOK and how to initiate and plan projects. The practical tips provided by the instructor and panel discussion were very informative and useful.
Very good introductory course if you are new to Project Management.  I also liked the fact that the course is designed to help you build your project management knowledge and provides a clear pathway for more advanced training
This course is definitely aimed mainly at professionals who want to work for big organisations, but the content was explained very clearly and the panelist videos are very interesting for aspiring project managers. Thank you!
The course is a little bit hard to follow for the people who are just starting in the Project Management Area. It would be nice to have more video lessons and less additional material to consult. I liked the weekly exercises.
The course offers an inside into Project Management and what are the various parameters that project managers need to do and how to make decision to run a project smoothly and efficiently with cross domain functionalities.
Very useful information and a good start. My suggestion would be to have more interesting videos. There are more creative ways of presenting information that helps the student stay engaged. Perhaps a less formal approach.
A comprehensive introduction to good practices and approaches provided by the PMBOK framework, emphasizing the importance of criteria over methodologies, and establishing a fresh perspective towards conflict management.
the course is good and it gives basic ideas about planning project the video lecture are very easy to understand i like the last video where expert panelist shared their experience and the flash reading material is good
This is a good course for anyone in a project management role or is looking for a role similar to project management, the course modules explains the concepts from the PMBOK really well and keeps the learner engaged!
Margret Meloni is an amazing expert. She simplifies very important topics in a very interesting way. The issue that I faced, that the lessons were in flash format not a pdf, which didn't allow me to print them.
Its a very good course for beginner which makes you familiar to about project. How to initiate project and planning for the project. WBS is best part of this module that is really helpful in real time project.
That's an amazing course for beginners to learn how to planing and initiating for your project. In addition, you will know some basic information about your organization, stakeholders, and conflict resolutions
The course is great, the information is very realiable and well presented. I would suggest breaking down the information into several video lectures. More than one video lecture for each week would be awesome.
very informative course that gives basic understanding of project management. The materials are easy to read and prepare you for PMP certificate if you wish to. Yet, I hope to have more quiz or practice test.
nice course, I would have loved more video, they were engaging and useful. Also, the course needs more exercises and quizzes are far too easy. A good recap on the subject, helped me, could have been better
A very brief and compact course. I would really like it more if even the tools and techniques are introduced in between inputs and outputs. otherwise course was very useful for beginners like me. Thank you
It was a good course to initiate the project planning and management but needs more work on the exercise and final exam. As all of the final exam questions were already done in the individual weekly exam.
This course was tremendously helpful for someone who, like myself, may have a background in planning but was never taught a formal approach to it.  It really was a pleasant surprise to find this course.
Superb way of explaining, courses materials are concise and to the point and the panelist videos are also awesome-It would be more better though  if you add a hands on project with this also at the end
I think out of all the options for learning about project management and eventually to pass the PMI, this ranks near the top. There is certainly room for improvement, but overall a reasonable approach.
I really got hooked throughout this course. I loved the idea of expert panelist at the end of course. I have much confidence to apply this knowledge in the real world. Looking forward to other courses!
Great course. Teaches you a lot of new things related to Project management. Only issue I faced was the flow and how it fits together. A quick summary of all week courses in the end goes extra mile.
It was great way to start the journey to the Certification. The videos were very good. I feel the reading requires more depth and probably more case studies for better understanding of the subject.
Would have liked to have known about the additional books required to buy to fully understand the course. The instructor never really gives an overview and the flash lessons should be downloadable.
The syllabus is carefully structured. Well defined topics and the content is very well written and easy to understand. As a beginner I had absolutely no problem whatsoever in completing the course.
Great initiation into what is a project and getting started with your project. Great learning environment and presentation providing a good quantity of information without overloading the learner.
Interesting overview of the start of a project. Shorter thanks i expected. All the material can be covered in a week.Video content is good and clear. Written content could be more user friendly.
The course content gave me a good idea on project management. I think it would have been great if the reading materials were not so much definition based and had more example and visual content
Course was very informative and case study section was helpful. But I would like to see more of questions in case study section because it actually test your knowledge with real time situations
The course is very structured. It has started with basics and helped me to understand the content by taking real-time case scenarios. However, the quality of case studies should be improved.
Very informative. The professor is knowledgeable and relatable, and easy to listen to. The structure of the course supports all learning modalities and is effective if you put in the effort.
I think , you need to take more quiz and exercises in your course outlet, otherwise it showed bulk of garbages( sorry to say )..please add some more quiz tests in our course. Thank you MAM.
The course is good for a start in the Project Management field. It has covered various terms and techniques required by a Project Manager to Plan, Execute and Close the project efficiently.
Great course! It would be even better if lecture and study could be blended a bit more (occasionally felt like the material was just covered twice), but overall good content delivered well.
Very interesting and well organized. Sometime it's pretendet to have the pmbok that should not be essential for the book. In geleral there is a week connection between lectures and classes.
Fantastic course, very interesting. Useful even if you are not looking to become a full time project manager and just are simply involved in projects and would like a better understanding
Good planning and execution of this course...a little dry, and too much repetition for me, but I can see where that helps to reinforce learning for various learners and their styles.
its have a lot of very useful information including the bonus videos, but the way we are examined could be more challenging and the discussion forum would have been very interesting
I liked the course - it's detailed, short and provide a lot of information.The only thing I did not like is the final exam that include all the same questions as from other quizes.
pretty good, maybe it would be better if the supplemental materials were provided, or instead they added more richness to the course material rather than leaving optional readings.
While the nature of the work is not new it gave me the language to articulate what I have already being doing throughout my career. The videos and concepts were well presented.
The course is a good introduction to the topic.One improvement I'd like to suggest is to avoid using the questions from the intermediate quiz'es in the final test, if possible.
A lot of information, the explanation is clear and intriguing, wish the course could provide more detailed cases and examples so beginners would find them easier to visualise.
Inclusion of a little bit more of some interactive content and videos will be greatly appreciated. Overall a really good course. Please rely less on PMBOK Guide. Thank you.
I thought this course was excellently administered and was much better than than many of the online courses I took as an undergrad. I'm excited to start on the next course.
Great course, a good overview of project initiation from an American PMI perspective. Video's are clear and correlate with the lessons and exams. No ambiguity, enjoyed!
A great course with to-the-point lectures and lessons covering all areas related to Initiating & Planning Projects. Would like to see inclusion of more case studies.
It is a great course, they should just expand more and do more questions, the TMBOK  guide goes why deeper, they should also but nether the less it is a great course
It was a nice journey with this course. It will be helpful for the project starters. They will overcome their fear & will be confident after completing this course.
Good information, quizzes and exams reasonable in competency relevance. "Flash Lessons" are quite wordy, difficult to process information portrayed in these slides.
A good and comprehensive introductory course with valuable pm tools. However, the tests and the final exam were almost too easy. Could be created more challenging.
Great pace and content of instructor. Helped put a actual perspective rather than what can become a dry and very process intensive effort to learn this material.
Interesting course with a good business and scientific approach to Project Planning - the course lacks of real life examples, but again the content is clear.
I love attending courses in coursera. The lecturers explain every details along with examples, real instances. This helps to get a good idea on the topic.
Great information for beginners. Having more cases and practical examples to apply what we learned would be very interesting. Overall, a very good course.
Nice basic course of project management, with basic to medium level information. Good introduction to the subject if you follow the whole specialization.
the course was nice and clear in all ways through to the end and the videos really give you a clearer picture of what is to be covered.I was so grateful.
lack of organization, most of the course is readings, lack of case studies, acceptable in general, one of the rare courses in project management anyway
I wish the lectures were longer and more comprehensive and the reading was less of the bulk of the course. Still - learned a lot and love the lessons.
I would give it 5 stars but I had an issue with the final exam and had to take it 5 times before it stopped throwing errors. Otherwise a great course.
The lesson are very helpful and the course is  full of interesting  knowledge at project planning, however the teacher is kind of passive to explain.
Good as a touchbase course on Project management. Too much time spend on conflicto resolution vs other skills Sucha as managing costs or deliveravles
The only comment I have is regarding the week 4. I've got confused sometimes. I read, read again but I think need more examples to understand better.
the power point slide buttons are slightly off so you have to pay attention to when clicking the interactive lessons. Otherwise a great intro course
Overall, a great course backed up strongly be doing the optional background reading. Would recommend to new and experienced project managers alike.
Loved the learning and tools described and clear definitions of the scenarios arising and their respective handling. Very helpful for any manager.
Naturally, I found this section more difficult than the previous courses. I still suggested this to other coworkers, subordinates and supervisors.
I like this coruse and I hope to allow downloading the lessons "PDF" for the students to get more benefits and to save these lessons as References
Very interesting approach to the Project Manager world. Even if you have already some experience this course allows you to have a different view.
Easy to understand concepts on PROJECT MANAGEMENT. Best for all LEVEL of professionals who wish to enhance their knowledge on Project Management
While this course delivers satisfactorily the basics for project management, the content could be updated by including more expert interviews.
I enjoyed the course, I like the lessons and the material. Easy to understand and good real life examples of what you face managing projects.
Thank interestny course, get for yourself a new required information, a mild form of lessons .Moya difficulty only in translation. Thank you.
Some terms are used before ever being defined. I wish there had been some exploration of the actual online platform and tools, such as Jira.
Well-structured lessons, comprehensively covers planning & initiation stages of project management. The quizzes felt a little easy at times!
Very easy to understand the basic concepts and not at all dull. Bonus videos could be better quality and more structured, but they are good
Good Course for beginners. Easy case studies. But there should be more videos than reading content. Overall, would recommend this course.
It's a very interesting course in order to get a overview about all processes involved in project management and how important they are.
It is a good beginner course. However, I wish they had more and better exercises and quizzes to test our understanding of key concepts.
The course was great and informing. I would like to see when you answer something wrong on a quiz/final that it show you the correct an
The course was quite interesting with some practical cases. Could be much productive if become more comprehensive. Thank you very much.
Great Course...Advise it for new people in project management world.  Exercises could be better (putting scenarios or simulators...etc)
I liked how the course focused on key concepts only, and kept out unnecessary information. The quizzes could have been more difficult.
Very informative and fast-paced. Allows review of past lessons. However the final video with the panelists have a poor audio quality.
As someone with no prior knowledge in Project Management, I enjoyed this course, and I look forward to the next course in the series.
Text heavy, but fairly easy to follow. I enjoyed the course and look forward to continuing the speciality. Thank you for this course.
I'd suggest this course to anyone whom wants to get started with project management. Clear and specific points on the various topics.
It is a good introduction for beginners to PMBOK or a refresher for experienced personnel preparing for the PMP certification exams.
Great introduction to the basics of project management.Fast Forward MBA in Project Management text required to get the full benefit.
It's a nice and informative course, although grading could be a tab more difficult, especially the final quiz. I am here to learn!
Interesting and carefully delivered.Too theoretic for me, especially as  I'm trying to get acquainted to project management field.
Decently engaging. In this course I am too obsessed with verbatim type questions as opposed to questions concerning best practice.
The course is great especially for starters. Very academic approach though. Some practical examples were given from time to time.
It was an interesting and good structured course. It would be just great to update it to the newest edition of PMBOK. Thank you.
A lot of speech and no real case study, only one example. Need to have the PMBOK guide otherwise this course is not interesting.
Very crisp course, well explained. Maybe they can include a few activity/ assignments/ peer reviews to strengthen the knowledge.
Easy to understand and can refer back to the notes easily. Would be better if we could download the slides for future reference.
it is a great course that helps you as a beginner to understand the principles of initiating and planning in project management
A well detailed and certainly practical approach to learning and understanding the dynamics of project planning and management.
Recommended for beginner to know basic knowledge of project management. The course easy to understand and full of interactive.
Very informative and challenging, however, I was hoping it gives more in depth information. Still great course for the money.
More Video Explanation would be wonderful. It will help us, the students to understand better. All in all enjoyed the course.
Amazing, course. Gets you started on what you need. Just wish that the PMBOK guide book was included in the course for free.
Very nice course! However I would like to watch more videos, otherwise there is not a big difference between reading a book.
For Project initial planning & understanding it is very helpful. The course has the scope of all aspects with key knowledge.

Insightful and rich content including relevant study cases that are good to visualise different scenarios in real life.
Great guide for tackling down the PMBOK, by providing a sense of progress while going through the very extensive PMBOK.
Good course. I like the way the lecturer explains thing. They are very easy to understand, even for a beginner like me
Very good and interesting course.  But I had to go back and fourth to complete my notes as the course was progressing.

Good basic introduction to Project Management. I wish they gave more examples of how it comes together with forms etc.
The course is informative for beginner who wants to know basics about different aspect to consider managing a project
8/10, Ι am very much satisfied and looking forward to completing the other 2 courses on Project Management Strategy.
It was good course but can be finished within 4 hours instead of 6 weeks which means the content isn't large enough.
Interactive lecture, with good breakdown to the core of the knowledge area, but also with a look on the big picture.
I enjoyed it, It was my first experience doing a online course, I can definitely recommend these courses to people.
Very good and simple to understand, the instructor was very clear and uses simple example as well simple language
They cover the basics of initiation really well. I just think that the lecture videos are delivered too quickly.

This course provide a overview of project management. Also it leads me to think the PM problem in real business.
It is most usefull course here i have joined I got a lot of infomation from, with high Efficiency!thanks at all!

The resources are helpful and the Professor has a wonderful demeanor making it easy to understand the content.
Useful and interesting, but seemed a bit easy; I completed the whole course in only a few hours worth of work.
I appreciated the course I think that could have given more tools for project managers to apply their skills.
multiple abstract cancepts in this course that need some concrete case study examples to apply and understand
I liked the course very much but at the same time, I felt the need for more case studies and video lectures.

Many examples in this course helps a project manager to become accountable and responsible for his job
The pillars to planning a project are well described, but I would like to have more practical sections
it is ok for the first beginner like me, and this is suitable for busy people to learn the main ideas.
It is a good start but not for engineers .if you are engineer i think you should go to the next course
Short introductionary course with some pointed directions how you can follow further into this topic.
Its really a quick learning program in busy schedules and specially a perfect place for new learners.
Very good summary of the material. The only bad thing Is perhaps the long presentations for reading.
Great course and very comprehensive . It comes with additional videos to help you understand better.
Loved it! It exposed me to a lot of insights into project management that I will surely put to use.
Great class.  Very practical knowledge.  I wish I would have taken this class earlier in my career.
Presenter was easy to listen to and having the additional exercises helped understand the material.
The course is very good but they should not promote that much the PMBOK. It is extremely annoying.

I have completed the initiating and planning and project management course and I must confess Molony made it simple in the videos by explaining the secrets to decipher the PMBOK in very simple terms
I enjoyed this course, the mix of the video presentations and the powerpoints are well done. The instructor did an excellent job. the 'bonus videos' and 'panelist interviews' are very good as well.
I found this course to be very helpful to me in understanding what a project and project management is. Though, I may not handles projects for my current employer, the processes discussed here can help me to be more productive and efficient in my work environment. I am able to have a project attitude for non-project assignments. I also enjoyed the mix of videos and reading powerpoints. Plus, everything is at my own pace so that makes it less stressful.
This is absolutely worth everything that I invested into this course. And I do not mind studying it all over again! I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn project management.  Thank you Margaret.
It was a very good experience joining in Coursera
Doing this course 'Initiating and Planning Projects' gives learners, practical skills on Project management based on PMBOK methodology which is framed by PMI based on contributions from experienced professionals in the field.  Prof Margaret Meloni is a great teacher. Students will enjoy her crisp, clear and lucid style of communicating ideas. Slides are  well designed. Video  quality and sound quality is also great. You will encounter lots of good  quality reading materials. Quizzes will help you to test your knowledge  as you progress. Overall, an excellent course fit for project managers  and project team members who work for construction projects. Also good  for the aspiring project managers. Thanks to Prof Margaret and UC Irvine  for the great course.
I have never been so glad to take an online class before. The instructor did a phenomenal job in choosing which parts of the lessons to elaborate on and just how deep she should go into the particular she chose to focus on. This is not to say that she didn't give a balanced and complete overview because there can be no doubt that she did. What was especially impressive with the class is that it was the perfect amount of information covering all the basics plus a few optional additions that adequately and efficiently introduces on to the world of Project Management. I highly recommend this course especially as taught by this particular instructor. 5 big stars without qualification. Thanks from Oceania.
There is a LOT of material in this course. The videos go a little too fast at times, so a 10 minute video would usually take me like 20 so I could get some notes from it. The presentations are perfectly structured, but they are a bit long, so again plan on spending a good 20 minutes per presentation if you plan on taking notes and all.Finally, the role of the PMBOK Guide as complimentary material to this class is strongly under-emphasized in the introduction. However, all optional reading is from this guide and another book also mentioned in the introduction. Maybe mention this in the intro so people can make a more informed decision as to buying those books or not.
It was very helpful for me to understand what the project management is. I am just thinking about starting this new career path and i was feeling comfortable in this field during the learning process.
Amazing overview of the project pipeline
First of all, a big THANK YOU for offering MOOC. It enables me to gather knowledge on subjects I am interested in and to help boost my career development. About the moduls/lectures taught here: there is no doubt that there are lot of definitions and sequences of processes in Project Management that need to be learnt by heart. I have borrowed the PMBOK and after taking a brief look at the contents I felt confused and do not know where to start.Thanks to the brilliant Margaret Meloni, she showed me the way out of this labyrinth. By her easy-to -understand lectures I am able to grasp the overall picture of Project Management. The bonus videos aber her experiences as a project manager habe been wittily narrated and very essential as they give us a glimpse into the practises in the real world.Thank you all for your efforts!
Very good course to cover the basics of Project Management.  If you have been on projects already, this course can provide insight as to why somethings went wrong and brings you back to the intent of the PM role.  I have been encouraged that the process of becoming a PM can be daunting, through daily work, I have been exposed to much of this and can now assign industry terminology and methodology to what I am doing.  If you have never done any PM work, this will give you a glimpse of what is involved.  The format is so direct and simple (in the best way :) ) I think that people currently in some type of this role will appreciate the content more than someone who has never done any project work.
I like the way how this course is structured and easy to follow in addition to the way it directs your attention to things that you really need to be aware of in your career
This course provides some practical situation which enriches my acknowledgment about being a responsible in any project  and it also helps me to understand the planning process management proficiently!
The course is a very great asset to any aspiring project manager. You get to understand the fundamentals and essentials in any given project and the means to ameliorate conflicts amongst stakeholders.
Thank you to Coursera for such a great platform to improve our skills and literacy.The learning environment offered here is completely a learn at your own pace environment,making it flexible to learn.
I really enjoyed this class because it is truly SELF paced. Yes there are deadlines  for submitting the quizzes but I feel those are just to keep me on track. I got to go as fast as I needed, still received feedback from the quizzes that I was learning what she set out to teach me.  I enjoyed watching her videos.  They were engaging, short enough to keep my attention and long enough to really present the material for me to understand.  Plus I liked that there was optional reading that was really optional.  I would recommend this class to others. I put in the amount of time she has listed on her time suggestions at the minimum so this was a great course that worked well in my personal and work life.
In addition to luck, the most important factor that determines the success of man is his perspective on life.

Carol Dweck of Stanford University says that the common feature of successful people is their perspective on life. These people are focused on continually improving the opportunities and abilities given to them. They see life as a journey of "learning", "growth", "development", "maturation". For this reason, they are always focused on development and self-renewal (Growth Mindset)

Others think that the opportunities and abilities given to them in life are fixed. These people with a fixed mentality think that they will complete life with the innate opportunities and abilities given to them. Therefore, they believe that it is not necessary to strive to learn and progress (Fixed Mindset).

However, life proves the opposite. The reason for the failures of the very talented, well educated children of the wealthy families is the “fixed mentality” they have. This mindset prevents them from learning, developing, growing, maturing and being successful.  I learned a lot thanks to coursera, thank you to everyone who contributed
My sincerest gratitude to the University of Nueva Caceres,Naga City Philippines and University of California, Irvine for my successful On-line Free Course Completion on Initiating and Planning Projects as I worked hard to get the course completed amidst the challenges I confronted like time constraints, pressure of daily field and office works and especially the stress of the deadly COVID19 Pandemic which caused so much thinking and abiding of the strict implementation of health protocols to keep safe and well and cramming due to poor and fluctuating internet connection. These opportunity keep us active on line putting  considerable measure of finishing the course whatever it takes and the outcomes was truly satisfying. A debt of gratitude is in order for everything.
Initiating and Planning Projects by University of
California, Irvine taught me a new skill set of knowledge applicable to
my overall career and self-development. The topics are all relevant and
delivered professionally by the subject matter experts. The discussions and activities
are well organized for learners to gain a better understanding of the course.I really appreciate University of California, Irvine
and Coursera for granting me financial aid in completing this course. This opportunity
gave me a life-changing learning experience.Completing the course is worth the time and effort. Highly
recommended to all learners to take this course.Thank you Initiating and Planning Projects team!
Thank you University of California, Irvine!Thank you Coursera!
It was a very good course to get the basic knowledge regarding role of the project manager during the initiating and planning of a project. Since the actions of a project manager during this part will be impacted throughout the project, this phase is very critical. In this lesson series that importance and risks were well delivered. Videos were short and sweet which makes them very interesting to watch. Reading contents are also very briefly presented. The interview session with the expertise in the field which is presented in the final week is very valuable and also the additional videos which were provided after completing the  quiz every week.
This course was very informative and new to me.  At first I thought it was going to be a great challenge because it was different, but after reading the PMBOK and doing the required quizzes I got a better understanding of what I was doing.  I was able to mirror what I was learning to things I encountered daily while working at the construction company and this provided a great point of reference and made it  all seem real.  I will definately be completing the full course available.  Happy that I attempted this and enjoyed doing it..
High level of video and reading material. One of the best courses I’ve taken on Coursera. Be advised through, the time reference for the reading material is rather misleading; due to the volume of information in each reading module, reading through it all and taking notes (which you will need in order to pass the module and final exam) will definitely take you longer than the stated 10 mins. Overall, a great course that’ll definitely be useful in my pursuit of a career as Project Manager.
This course is unique way to improve professional skills to imbibe the basic contents of project management for professional development of Young project managers. Especially I would like to thank Margaret Maloney ,Course instructor for her patience and simple language to explain and make understand each and every phase in project planning and also thanks for the panellist interview with 
















Marty Wartenberg ,Neil Sahota ,Karen Nguyen for sharing their experiences.
It was an exciting opportunity to follow an online course such as this one. This was my first online course experience. It worked so well. It has been planned and  organised very effectively conducted by the course instructors, especially Ms Margaret Meloni. Her vedios and the introduction to PMBOK were informative. Doubly contended about having put my COVID-19 lockdown days to achieve something useful from home. A big THANK YOU. Wish to follow more courses soon.
I really had no clue how much I had to learn about Project Management.  I thought because I'd spent a number of years doing project management on the job, I'd be flying through the courses easily.  What I discovered was basically a new language with practicable and meaningful applications that deepened my appreciation for the materials and courses.  I have so much to learn (hope this is always the case anyway) and look forward to future courses in this arena.
Amazing in it's simplicity! It allowed me to understand the core concepts of Project Management without all the fluff that exists in some on campus courses. Truly designed with the professional in mind. Quick, simple, comprehensive, all with a very professional appearance. I especially appreciated the real life examples and the case studies Melonie presented. They really helped me better understand the principles she was trying to explain.
I have been working in various  indigenous and international based  Humanitarian  community development projects for over ten years.  Working  in these organization has given me the opportunity to attend  training organized both at home and international levels. compare to all training  I attended, I found yours really exciting and helpful to person like me who have ambitions to enrage in  project planning,design and implementation.
Love the Bonus video part of the course! The course has a simple structure and helps you work through the key factors in Project Management efficiently. I recently began to work on a project. With the ios App and self-paced course, I can learn the course while I am commuting between work and home in one week. I plan to work on stakeholder registry and WBS with team members to bring the concepts into practice. Big applause to Meloni!
A good course .I am pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and this is my first course in PMP and hence find it very informative from my perspective since I don't have any prior knowledge of Project Management .Very informative , Lot of material for reading is provided with good examples for application of the knowledge.I guess most the CS or Engineering  students would find it Very informative . It is Worth taking the Course
I have attended a few project management online courses and most of the time, the material is being presented in attached, theoretical form that you spend most of your time trying to stay interested. However this course presented interesting topics in a way that is relatable and understandable . I am invested because Ms. Meloni gave her real life experiences, showing  the importance of the  material to success. Thank you
First course of the specialisation "Project Management Principles and Practices Specialization".You will learn the basis of a project, how to manage stakeholders, what is a project charter,...It's a great course about project management. It's a 6 week duration but you will work less than 2 hours a week.I recommend this course if you are ready to do all the specialisation because doing this course only makes no sense.
Excellent course! Very well organized and great integration with the reading material. In particular I found the workload and learning material easily digestible as a full-time working professional. Ms. Meloni is fantastic at communicating the critical elements of project management academic material while simultaneously integrating the curriculum with 'real-world' situations. Well worth the money and the brainpower!
I enjoyed the course immensely. Excellent course material, and an outstanding instructor make the "Initiating and Planning Projects" course rock. Bonus videos are a treat and and filled with practical advice and wisdom. You can be confident that this course is a great value add, and a wise investment of your time and effort. If you are studying with your PMP exam in mind, then you now know where to look.
Comparing the other courses, this course is very accurate and target-specific. It helped me to understand the project management theoretically and also made me realize how challenging it is by the real examples. I loved all parts but my favorite part is the week 6 which includes the panelists, because they are the real mentors for a new beginner project manager. I am thankful for this course.
a big WOW to Margaret Meloni's style of instructions!I've tried taking  a few online project management course but lost the interest half way,  I am determined to complete this one,due to her simple approach of explaining the concepts related,very clear and precise.My understanding about the project management gets better after listening to her lectures.Keep up the good work!
One of the best Project Management course I have taken so far. The concepts are explained in a simplistic engaging format. The additional PMBOK related material covered through PPTs and as additional videos is extremely helpful and beneficial for someone who is planning to get their PMP certification. Case studies are also very interactive to understand the concepts.
This course was an excellent course for a Civil Engineer like me who has the potential of becoming a Project Manager in near future. Specially the course content was really high standard, and the presentations were very clear and attractive as well. Also the interviews were very useful in order to get an idea on field exposure.Thank you! Keep it up the great work!
This was very comprehensive and easy to understand with tasks and exercises that was very helpful in implementing every knowledge gained per modules.The program manager did a good job in breaking it into smaller units/modules for proper understanding. I strongly recommend you take this course if you interested in starting or growing a career in project management.
Great course to learn online for every individual aimed in becoming a successful Project Manager in the construction industry, public and private sector, and organization. I really love and enjoyed my period of learning this course with my Instructor Margaret Meloni, MBA, PMP. Though it requires time, dedication, and commitment. So i have earned my certificate.
Excellent course, especially for project managers like me, who have not had a formal training of project management. This course showed me several ways to do things in project planning that I have been doing the same way over the years. It has also impressed upon me, the importance of getting formal education/training to get to a higher level of understanding.
It is a great online course.  Although I am not an English speaker, nor having any experiences about initiating and planning project, now I have general ideas about what it is about. The lessons are not too hard to understand but at the same time, they are challenge enough for a beginner like me. So, thank you, UCI, for creating this online course.
This was an exceptional overview of project management, with a lot of information that was very well presented.  I look forward towards finishing this specialization.  I took a year long project management program with Boston University and this specialization from UC Irvine is a excellent review of that material.  I highly recommend this course.
The course is a fantastic refresher on basic principles of Project Management. Margaret Meloni presents material in an engaging format. In fact you can see her wealth of experience shine throughout the whole course. Case studies and panel interviews also did add a bit of 'practical' flavour to PMBOK fundamentals. Recommended by a Project Manager!
Honestly, I didn't know a lot about project management that have learned here. PMBOK guide is really a helpful supplement. And the matrix-based analysis was much more understandable for me. I Experienced as a real project manager. I tried to learn the lessons more efficiently. Thanks to Coursera, UCI, and all the associates for this opportunity.
This was first course with the organization, having 20yrs above experience in the industry. Planned to upgrade my knowledge skills seeking your help. Well must say morale is boosted & feel quite motivated for having learnt the strategic ways of engagement which were missed so far in my role towards the organization working for. Thanking you.
This course is highly recommended to all those doing and planning to make projects.The knowledge and skills in this course can make someone to make and have a successful project.Great thanks goes to An instructor and the coursera supporters for enabling me to attain these skills and knowledge.99% are applicable for a successful project.

It was an amazing experience learning about projects. This course has helped me understand various ways in which organisations can work. It has also provided me with knowledge to manage human resources. Overall, its a good course for the beginners to get the basics. Thank You to the whole team for University of California, Irvine.
I really enjoyed this class. I liked how it was structured and the duration of each video. I was able to take this online class during my work schedule, because it did not impact my program. I enjoyed a lot professor Margaret Meloni and the way she delivered her speeches.  She inspired me on how to deliver my own speeche
I am not a business major or something. In fact, I'm a premed student but I find this course very helpful as it can be used in any situation be it something big or small. The course is also well-designed and everything needed is there already. I don't regret taking this course! I think this will help me in the long run!
Very nice introductory course to PM. Well-balanced in terms of content, with a mix of videos and powerpoint presentations. Really enjoyed the case-studies and the interview with panelists. Easy and comfortable to follow. The instructor did a very good job. Thank you to the whole team for providing this amazing course.
Great course. Gave me a good overview, actually more than an overview, of project management.   Lecture was to the point and easy to understand.  Lessons were presented in a very informative and logical manner.  I really enjoyed the video tips at the end of each lesson and the panelist discussion in the last lesson.
This course was an excellent introduction to Project Management. The material was well laid out and the pace was good.  I recommend that any one challenging the course obtain a copy of the PBOK guide, for the recommended readings.  You can successfully complete the course with out it but I found it added depth.
I found this course to be invigorating, knowledgeable, and relevant. I am very happy I took it.  I will be able to immediately use the skills I learned. I hope to learn as much in the next course leading to my goal to a specialization. Thanks for all the support,  and making my time here worth all the effort.
This is a well written course, the video lessons are very helpful. Because of  Coursera.org, I have improved my knowledge and understanding of project management 100%. This is a big help on my job, thank you so much.  Since I am working, being able to stop and come back to finish the lesson is a huge benefit.
Thank you very to UCI for such opportunity. I am fully satisfied with the course and I can't wait to get into the next courseI highly recommended this course to those who would like to take Project management as part of their career.Thank you so much once again  Margret Melon , You're really incomparable
Good trainer and very informative! The best I like is the videos do not spent too long to explain the concept if compare to some other online courses that I have taken in another online learning portal. Sharing of experiences also make us have a better overview about handling in the real world. Awesome!
This course covers all information regarding Project Planning, formation of management team, organizational structures, and documentation process which enhance the quality and learning in the course.I will recommend this course to all candidates who are willing to opt Project Management Career. Thanks !
Amazing course and platform.  For the first time I learnt about it, and the way the concepts were cleared was amazing. I wish if I could enroll some other subjects, or in the near future. Last but not the least HEC Pakistan played a great role for the students to use this productive and free platform.
This course is really great cause it covers the basics, meaning students or individuals who are beginners will have no problem learning the basics of Project Management. This initial part of the course may be quite technical and easy, but it's a nice means to start how a Project Manager should think.
I really liked this course. I find the content and materials delivered very interesting and useful for my career development. However, I find that there are too many opportunities to pass each week, which makes the course extremely easy to pass for everyone even without trying hard (moral hazard :) )
Extremely interactive, simple to understand and I enjoyed the different teaching styles with the readings, videos and little exercises within the material. Very engaging. The panel interviews added a nice practical touch to the course as it shows what we learn is not just theory but rather useful.
excellent prep. lots of info in this course. i personally passed it 100% o first try, but feel in need to take once or twice in full to digest all info within this course. overall great learning opportunity and very comprehensive. Good mix of video and reading and valuable blend of info sources
Very Good course to initiate yourself on Project Management. It makes a good job at teaching you the basics and showing you which tools are available to project managers. That said, it doesn't do a lot of emphasis on how to use those tools, but that information you can easily find it elsewhere.
First of all i would like to thank Margaret Meloni for her sincere efforts for making us understand the basics of project management. this course gives us very good idea about the initiation activities of a project, human resource management , organization structures and conflict management.
It was a very wonderful and well designed course. Module wise extra reading and the perfect quizzes have built the confidence in the learner as course progresses. The lecture videos are very good and helped me to comprehend the concepts. It was a very nice and pleasing learning experience.
Extremely well versed and well read instructor with a very good understanding of what is important and what is not so much in an introductory course. Relevant subject matter and the course was laid out in a very organized and logical way. Would recommend to anyone interested in this field.
This course was very easy to follow along with. The videos and the course activities were interactive, tons of important information from all courses. This certificate took me less than a month to complete, working for a couple of hours twice a week. I highly recommend this certification.
This was  very informative course, especially with the optional readings. I learned a lot of the basics around initiating and planning projects as well as the terminology around this area in project management. The videos were informative while being short enough to watch in one sitting.
This is a fantastic introductory course for anyone with Project Management responsibilities. It gives you an overview of the basic skills and requirements needed to be a successful project manager and introduces first techniques on how to best manage scope, key stakeholders and conflict.
I love this course. I love how I can slow down the video for the professor to speak slowly and she actually does so I can take notes. I also like how she provides you with a slide deck on the lecture so you can also go over that as well to learn (or re-learn) the information. Thank you!
Many thanks for this course. I would love it.Materials of the course are were very exactly formulated and understandable.Margaret Meloni made this course as colorful with her melody voice and good explanations.I think i will use knowledge which i got from the course in my future works.
The videos are rather short, concise, and very informative. Ms Meloni is quite clear and explicit with her explanation and general understanding of the terms she is teaching. Highly recommend this course for anyone who is just starting out their learning process in project management.
An excellent introduction to initiating and planning projects for which you are PM. The material was presented in a clear and precise way with frequent reference to PMBOK, allowing further study and reading. I feel like a gained a good overview for this stage of a project as a PM.
This is the best course I have ever seen. Margaret Meloni is an amazing speaker. It's really a pleasure to hear her. Her explanations and real-life examples help understand the topic very fast. I recommend this course to everyone who are in any way related to project management.
Wow! what an experience! The course was so informative, it has ignited my appetite and I'm now thirsting for more and more of such learning. The professor was very excellent in her delivery of the content, I enjoyed the course all the way to the end. Thanks for the opportunity
I just audited this course for free to acquire some additional knowledge about project management. The course is easy to follow, well written, and I enjoyed it. The author gives valuable information about the PMP certification, if this is something that you intend to pursue.
Informative yet easy for the layperson to understand, this course felt like a great in-depth look at the first two process groups of project management. I feel like I have gained useful skills for a future career in this field and will be continuing with the specialization.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. If you are a beginner and are just getting into Project Management, this course will be a good fit. The lectures were good and I liked the fact that the course included lessons from the PMBOK to further expand on what you just learned.
I don't regret taking this course. By curiousity I just wanted to do something different, learn new skills and at the end of it I just realized this course spans through all domains of life. I am looking forth to use the skills acquired to upgrade my working standards.
This course has helped me better understand the field of project management. I have now a very good grasp of the project cycle and have been introduced to the PMBOK. the instructor was friendly and has wonderful pedagogical approach. I strongly recommend this course.
Great introduction to project management! Videos were easy to follow - delivering real life examples of the challenges within project management! The best part was the tools to help you get the job done! Thank you! Thank you! Will be following up on the next course!
It's a very good course, that focus on the essential in the videos and provide a lot of detailed and useful information in the material. The bonus videos bring additional insights that are relevant and which you would think as "I could use that" in real situations.
It's a very knowledgeable course and it is very beneficial if someone is interested to take the path as a leader and and a Project Manager. Although I don't have the PMBOK Guide, throughout the course everything has been explained in a neat and organized manner.
The form of knowledge stimulation is very well organised throughout this course. I am highly satisfied with the materials, as well as applications. What I highly value is the presence of real situations, which stimulate the implications of the given information.
Content of the course is very clear and very well structured. I have started this to improve my skills under a different area where I'm not engaged in day to day business. This course gave me a very positive start and helped me to put the foundation strongly.

concise and clear way of teaching. Best regards to the UCI team for putting up this amazing and esaily understandable version. Its easier to read the guide now for details which would ot have been possibe without the video lessons & bonus sessions
Really great job of explaining concepts in detail and their relevance. This gave me a great idea of what project managers do and whether or not this was something I wanted to pursue. Also includes tips and suggested readings related to PMP/PMBOK.

Excellent course. Great professor. I especially loved the interview with the panelists. I loved the bonus videos because they were about personal experiences in project management, such as conflict between the project stakeholders. Great course.
I found a lot of the topics covered in this course helpful for Project Managers. Going forward I would like to see more case-studies involved. But to summarize, I would certainly recommend this course to professionals new to Project Management.
Great overview of the core initial basic principles of project management. Helpful in enabling decision making, to pursue project management in more depth; as well as providing useful concepts, techniques and methodologies to apply immediately.
Very good instruction and I really liked that I can start and stop everything on my schedule.  Also it helps when you miss something and you can just restart or go back to it.  I also liked the discussion at the end with the Project Managers.
The course was really initiative and it helped me in recolecting a lot of techniques and terms from my Business school. Hope there are more simillar courses that can improve your skills for carrer building and a lot more insights on reality.
Great coverage of the early phases of a project.  I'd like to see the content reference PMBOK for newbies, but this course does a nice job of developing awareness and understanding of the Initiating & Planning Phases of the Project ifecycle.
I have really enjoyed this course and learnt a lot from worthy instructor and grasp adequate knowledge to initiate project as well as planning process. The Panelists videos are amazing to get knowledge from the experienced project managers.
Its a great platform to study , to learn many new subjects , many new topics which is very useful for the Professional Career I Thank all the team members who provides such a useful and Grateful platform for all Professionals  and Students.
Excellent and thank you very much. really appreciate everyone for working hard and your time and attention.Education is for everybody and your organization has gone an extra mile to help everyone with the knowledge to make this world grate.
It is a very nice course to get an idea of Project Management and how to deal with the different situations that you could have to face on your day-to-day activities during the Project development. Very helpful and quite easy to understand.
Project management is usually associated with nervous activities and hard emotional states of participants but Margaret Meloni shows that it can be calm and smooth with excellent and clear explanations! It's amazing, she changed my mind!!!
Great place to learn the application of the theoretical concepts that are given in PMBOK. The bonus lecture were great and the expert interviews also gave an insight into the project management practices followed by top level executives.
I needed this course to more understand the work my organization deals with. now I have the knowledge i need to assist my manager in preparing and understanding the stakeholders, scope and human resources in planning our future projects.
It was a beautiful experience learning  and I enjoyed learning because I was able to gain alot about initiating and planning project with team members and communication skills in the office environment. thank you so much for this lesson
This course is a must try tour of insights in project management specially initiating and planning for all project managers, each lesson will deeply make you understand the importance of role and responsibilities of the project manager.
Very inspiring. I recently know how to planning project in detail with step-by-step. Previously I did some project management just go with the flow, without solid and rough planning. But, after this, I will do based on the lesson learn.
I feel much more knowledgeable about Project Management after taking this course. I've already used some of the lessons learned as I continue my job hunt. I plan to continue taking the courses in this series to earn the Specialization.
Am glad to have taken up this course, it has widened my understanding and more knowledge of carrying out a project, processes to follow , how to solve conflicts. I appreciate for this wonderful opportunity May you be blessed  Margaret.
This introductory course was amazing. It exceeded all my expectations about it. The course is developed for a smooth growth of knowledge through the weeks. The videos and the interactive material helps the student to learn more easily.
Fast moving course. Covered a lot of material quickly. I took this course as a refresher since I have managed a number of large projects in the past bit do not have a pmi certification. I learned some things! I glad I spent the time.
The course structure has been extremely flexible , allowing me to study at my convenience. It has also simplified the complexity of  studying  and understanding PM. This course has also greatly enhanced my career opportunities .
I think everyone who is interested in project management should have to take this course. Here you can learn how to tackle problems related to stakeholders and much more about planning and executing the project assigned to you.
This is a good course to learn project management with very detailed information and good explanation. I'd suggest to add more study case especially on risk management and "how to" create a good plan and execution of a project.
Am so happy that  my current project is propelled by the knowledge and skills of Project management acquired from UCI . Thanks a lot , it has really worked for me. Never will my projects hit dead end. Am sky rocking at moment.
This course is perfectly designed for the professionals in the field as well as for the fresher professionals. The concepts regarding the project management are easily taught in an easier and more user friendly wayBest wishes
Very well organized course. Not exactly what I was hoping to get into, but I'm glad I took it. I think I will be a better and more organized project manager, even if I am not applying these principles to such a specific task.
It is a very basic course. If you are a beginner thinking to take the course, do not get scared just start it. I understood the basics for project management through this course without any previous knowledge in this sector.
I had a lot of fun learning this course, Margaret made it especially easy, and the Panelist interview answered questions I often was confused about, and it also gave me the confidence about my approach to project management.
Enjoying this very much. It is directly applicable to my current line of work and I am finding ways to employ what I am learning on a daily basis. This is making me better at my job and I am happy to be part of this program.
