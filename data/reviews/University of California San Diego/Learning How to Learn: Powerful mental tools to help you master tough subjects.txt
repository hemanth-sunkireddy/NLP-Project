this course states tons of info that is obvious. I mean tons. at one point the instructor says if there is a class review before a test it would be a good idea to attend. At another point her colleague says you can get a lot of intellectual stimulation by having smart peers to talk to. They also say your brain will work better if you exercise and get a good night's sleep. Are you serious? This is your advice? Could this be any more obvious? The course is filled with obvious statements like this making it much longer than it needs to be. Seriously, it could be cut in half if not by two thirds. They also tell you the names of different chemicals in your brain. How this helps you learn better I don't know. There are a few good pieces of advice here and there. It's a shame you have to listen to so many lectures to hear them. They could have cut out the obvious stuff and got to the point much quicker.
Extremely boring and it doesn't provide anything really practical. All the concepts(that are really basic) could fit in 10 or 15 A4 pages, instead they wasted my time with an enormous amount of videos with no real reason. A waste of time. I can't understand why this course is surrounded by such a hype as the one it gets. A waste of time.
I took the course....and while I found it interesting it- I started to get emails from them every Friday since I've taken it.  The most recent email included information about an "important article" by racist white supremacist Adam Perkins.  They also called his book 'the welfare trait' - 'interesting'.....  A simple browse through his twitter will show you what kind of garbage this man believes.  After receiving this email- I can't trust the advise that these people give.  Don't support this course.
You can just complete the tests/exams without the need for reviewing the material, meaning it is pretty awful TBH.
How do people not know these basic fucking things. Bullshit that I have to spend my time on this crap. cheers
not good. i didn't learn anything, it was boring and quite frankly if you don't know how to learn already, a free course is not going to help, you need a professional.  this course is bad.
Filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbed-down and slow-paced. Offends the learner.
This course tells you to use a timer while studying without the TV on and to avoid procrastination. It also stresses review while learning. This isn't anything new. The course discusses diffuse and focused modes. Diffuse modes are described as being as important as focused modes.  Running, day dreaming and sleep can help enter diffuse modes and integrate focused learning. Save you time and skip this course.
I have finished the course, but I can't understand why everyone is giving such a high rating. Each and every advice in this course can easily fit in one 5 mins video and honestly I have learned far more simply by looking for learning techniques on youtube several years ago (I think now you can find even more information!). I thought in this course I could learn something new and interesting, but it was beyond measurement boring. I came to a point where I just made the quiz without looking the video or reading the text, because it is pretty obvious what the right answer is and you do not need to bore yourself with time-wasting videos or texts. To sum things from this course up: everyone can learn better through avoiding procrastination, focusing for short period of time, rewarding yourself for good results and doing basic stuff like training and good sleep. Here you go, the whole course content in one sentence!Save your time and certificate money (! I really don't know who would pay for such a crap!), it does not worthy to waste your resources on this course!
I had to do this course mandatory, unfortunatly I found the examples used for brain activety etc ´raping neuroscience´ (Given I have a background in this field) .  I understand that these methods work to let other people understand these 'octopus' brain stuff.I only had to take a look at the summary videos and could do all the 'exams' without any problems.I had some chuckles with some of the wrong answers, but that is about all the positive feedback I can give. It also brings some joy that I can see that you really enjoy what you are doing. Sincerely,Jelle de Poel
Dear Professors/Instructors/TAs/moderators/coders:It is very good for you to start your work in a very early time! BUT it is so rude to send emails/notifications/greetings/reminders to me in a very early/late time (e.g.,  7AM, 10PM). During that moment, I was waked up frequently by your emails which do NOT include a big deal.
To be honest, there are no techniques here that cannot be found in many other places. The only difference is that they explain the science behind the techniques, which in terms of practical application is not very useful at all.
Videos aren't of good quality and the tools aren't concrete enough to be useful. There is not enough material. I hope they will improve it because the subject is interesting.
It over simplifies everything... The only thing that is remotely difficult is reading the quiz, not because the questions are hard but because they have been written poorly.
Incredibly dated I couldn't stay engaged
its boring
The reason I gave just 1 rating is nor because course is well designed or bad content. I gave simply 1 rating because inspite of very intresting course content, voice quality is very bad. Specially when Barbara speaks, I tried to listen her with higest volume but she was not speaking louder enough.So I decided to sto stop the course. I didn't even complete week 1. I LOST MY INTEREST
I am very much grateful for the video. But I find the videos very much boring. Further, the concepts were not new as well. I believe that rating and giving an honest feedback would help the community.
Practical  tips  are few,  and neuroscience  is not the title of the course, but is widely discussed. The title implies  "Tools for learning" but I didn't get anything useful out of this course.
This course did not motivate me at all. Videos where mainly repetitive and the questions seemed to be there to serve no purpose.
its too bad course
not very useful
waste of time
This is definitely a course for someone that has finished a higher degree. if you've done that, there's a very big change that you already know about 90%-95% of the techniques presented in thous course.
Only part 3 was partly interesting and usefull. All the rest is vain.
Fuck this shit
Barbara Oakley (INTJ) is a living example that people should do what they have abilities to. Look at her verbal and non-verbal ways of communicating. Her sentences are logical, intermittent and structured. Her emotions are poor and monotonous. Even interrogative sentences look like declarative ones. I liked almost all the tools you gave, but the main idea is wrong, because it leads the brain of young people to mental disorders.
The irony here is that the "Learn how to learn" course teaches nothing. What's worse, it has vague references to dubious, and likely apocryphal tales of late geniuses and how they supposedly solved problems. So instead of teaching science based learning techniques, it is teaching folk tales of the "secretes" of geniuses.Don't waste your time. This is an embarrassment. I have come to expect far better from Coursera than this.
I completed my honours assignment and in my certificate no where it is mentioned the term "With Honours". This is against the policy of coursera.I am very said to say that I put so much effort and it was not worth it.But if you give me honors certificate I will give you 5 STARs.
The first chapter was pretty good. But everything else was just obvious things - check summaries and you will see. Learn, do breaks, sleep well, do sport, don't forget to repeat what've learnt. There are some interesting facts but they are not worth spent time.
this course is very important and will give a good remote to my study level and bring it upper than before, however the forum is one of the most crucial because gathered many classmates from across the world this might be made this course a significant.
this cours miss a lot of information and need to improuve i will give advice  please check cours edx how to learn mathematics and openclassroom  learning how to learn and thanks
DOES NOT WORK PROVIDE ONLY PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES IF ALL THE OTHERS MATERIALS ARE ONLY IN ENGLISH. YOU CAN MADE THAT COURSE MORE ACCESSIBLE. AT THE REST ALL WAS EXCELLENT
really slow videos with 0 detail, really weird questions after videos with answers such as "a million billion" idk what this is supposed to be
My friends gets this course certificate for free but i didn't get it for free any one can help to get this certificate for free
It was really useless and boring. The authors give some obvious advices which everyone can find in social networks.
"Learning how to learn" should also have had a few dedicated lessons about ANKI.
Very poorly recorder, a lot of distractions, hard to finish the course.
Water over water. Just selling the books and personalities.
kindly i want to unenroll from this course
I have to unenroll this course
Good teachers but... frankly the videos look outdated, very basic and talk a lot about concepts but nothing about how to apply what is supposed to elarn. It would be interesting to see someone studying and learning by applying what is stated above.I frankly don't understand all the hype around this course, found it boring.
In general, the course is very superficial. There are only a handful of useful ideas for learning in general (physical exercise, pomodoro for battling procrastination, analogies, interleaved testing and recall, spaced repetition) that can probably be taken from one of the teachers' TED talk.Another negative for me is that the focus is clearly for high-school students or early college. The final section, especially, is simply about passing exams. It never questions whether exams are actually effective or relevant to learning. Finally, there is the testing in the course. It goes against most of the ideas they taught. All of the questions are multiple-answer, often repeating the videos word for word, relying on superficial cues to finding the correct answer rather than actually knowing the material. The questions are also in the same order that they appear in the videos, which is exactly what they've advised not to do in the videos. Many of the possible answers are also obviously wrong, making it extremely easy to distinguish between the correct answers based on irrelevant information.It's not a completely worthless course, but it should be taken as a very small start, in my opinion. The extra materials (interviews especially) are good, at least giving people paths to follow depending on their specific interests.
The course has useful information, but I think it was a little superficial and too focused on studying for exams, instead of focused on studying for your professional life or just intelectual self development.
Based on the reviews I read, my expectations for this course were pretty high. However, the course ended up being very basic and I didn't learn any new learning technique. I think that for most people who have Googled study methods at least once, they will already be familiar with most (if not all) of the methods introduced in the course. The material may be useful for someone totally new to studying, but even then I would not recommend taking it. You can learn just as much is less time watching YouTube videos or reading brief guides on procrastination and learning techniques. The quality of the course was also disappointing. The volume in each video jumped up and down across lessons or when different speakers took the lead. I am surprised to see there's so much hype around this course despite its simplistic content and poor quality. I've taken more than a dozen courses at Coursera so far and this one doesn't even come close to the best ones I took.I'd recommend finding something better to invest your time on.
It really didn't help, and all the test questions and answers were jumbled and hard to understand. And i found it extremely difficult to follow along with the videos which just made my quizzes that much harder.  It's a good course and all, just not organized and everything the people were saying sounded exactly like the last one. Good idea and concept just not well prepared.
Some interesting information is presented that could be potentially helpful to students, teachers, & curriculum developers. However, there is little of practical value beyond a few simple statements, e.g. "Spread out your studying over several days." Or "Trying to remember is better than re-reading." Additionally, the course does not practise or model what it preaches.
Most of the information I learned was either already known to me or not that effective. I prefer more exercises and practical methods that would teach me discipline and let me implement the methods I've learned. The tests after each material are good and helpful for remembering the information; however, they are not practical to implement the methods themselves
The content is nice -- a few useful techniques with some scientific foundations, but why Barbara after EACH video reminds us her name, and this strange arrows with very unpleasant sound in the start of the videos about chunking -- why? There are a lot of things I can not understand in the production part, but overall course is worth taking  in 1.5x+ speed.
I found difficult to navigate within the course and the style of the course is not very modern. I felt difficult to follow the whole program, which might be also linked to my level of English that might not have been good enough, considering the technical vocabulary used in the program. However some interesting and very concrete tips to learn
This will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of education.Teachers show mastery on their subject matter , though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated, to the point that it may feel boring.
Interesting enough if you do not have any previous experience with the techniques.  You learn about the 2 different modes of Learning - Focused & Diffuse.Learn more by Remembering/Recalling, Testing yourself, learning from mistakes and using metaphors or analogies to understand concepts.
it has a lot of nice information about the brain and ways of study, but this whole course is a way of procrastinating.I feel like it could have been summed up really much better into written text and finished at a much faster rate.
Too school focused, I wish there was a version to help people that aren't being tested. I thought it would have more information about how to find useful information instead of just remembering what was presented to you.
While the instructors may be well versed in their fields, I felt the course took too long to get to the meat of the issue.  I suppose I wanted a faster-paced course without a lot of hand-holding.
this is a good course but if you think better and deeply you will understand that deep inside you your self know this things but maybe you did not do in daily life.
Didn't learn as much as expected about learning how to learn. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Really basic, with some interesting stuff but could be reduced to a third of the time...
Very basic and useful only for the students in high school... not for professionals.
Boring techniques for remembering. Nothing related to learning or understanding.
i think the coming classes will be great more than that ... but it's good
The interview at the end was the best part of this course.
extremely easy and sparse content.
I want it to be more exciting.
This is a course about common sense. People should save their time and money, and not take this course. It is less about learning techniques, and more about learning hacks, and biology to give the illusion of competence, mentioned frequently here in this course. The best way to learn how to learn is to expose yourself to different material, and see what pace works best for you, rather than take a course that supposedly teaches you how to learn. Go take a philosophy course instead.
I had a hard time staying involved. I kept falling asleep and still passed all the tests.  And the test questions are not worded well.  I had to read some questions multiple times before answering it.
I had high hopes since this course is quite popular, but it didn't add anything new to me, and mostly it was too vague to be practical.
I did not learn anything new...
Nothing special
What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki. The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.
This is a really very theoretical course, not really sure how much I can use this in real life. Let's see.
There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and "chunked" into real knowledge.So, a better name for this course would be "Learning how to learn academically". As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.
My background is a degree in Cognitive Science, and I believe my review may be more specific to this perspective. If your background is psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience, then you may not learn a whole lot of new learning techniques in this course. However, it was an easy and light refresher and provides a lot of useful analogies to reshape (or ingrain deeper) learning techniques you are already aware of. I did learn a few additional learning tools that I plan to implement. If your background is not from one previously mentioned (or similar), this is a great, easy course that will help you learn in all areas of life and is worth taking, esp. for the small time commitment each week relative to the potential life-long benefits.
The course is interesting, and packed with some easy to understand, easy to apply techniques. On the other hand, the real theory behind why these techniques work is deliberately omitted from the videos. This creates the feeling of a bit of esoteric knowledge, or, what it is worse, a feeling of trial and error techniques, like the ones anybody can develop on his own... Also the total lack of exercises makes it a little bit boring to follow at times. Overall, a good experience.Quick note of speaking speed: I understand that reading slowly is best sometimes, but Prof. Oakley is EXTREMELY slow, so much so, that I watched the videos at 1.25x and still felt like she was speaking at slightly slower speed than a normal person..
I found the production quality to be low enough to be distracting. Similarly, I think the scripting and performance are in need of being stepped up so they don't detract from the course. The concepts are useful and the facts of the topic are communicated well. However, many of the analogies used are childish and cheesy, I think. Also, the presentation is , awkward and amateur/primitive, imo. These days, there are kids putting out more gracefully performed and highly polish productions than this on Youtube. That makes be believe that it's within the realm of possibility that the caliber of the MOOC be increased significantly. Thanks, for learning how to learn ;)
This course targets mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago. Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts. What didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course. But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people. They were really motivating and inspiring!
It is very important that everyone knows this information, because it will make their lives better in a huge variety of ways. As it is a short course, I understand that many of the subjects were covered in a very superficial manner and that it couldn't be helped, but I would've loved that the focus of the lectures were on difficult concepts to grasp, and not merely the simplest of ideas that can be spoken about them. Another thing that I consider should be improved is the utter simplicity of choosing the right answers in the quizzes. I think that anyone could answer those questions correctly without the need of watching the lectures.
I was not too fond of some of the comments/thoughts presented (ie. test gods, lady luck, that zombie talk, and the discreet mention of evolution as THE fact - referencing to Charles Darwin as some great intellect). To me that was drawing the idea that the Almighty Creator does not exist. But that is silly, given that only  now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function - when He had that all figured out and established from the beginning. My point is, give credit where it's due. T
The contents were interesting. Presentation rather poor. The speeches seemd disorganized. I had to rely on transcrips: downloaded and edited. The comments are at times too casual. And other times too much special terminology. Most of times I understand what she was trying to say. But listening attentively was very difficult. Heavy americanism impedes understanding; especially when the student does not have familiarity with US pop culture. I had to check how a pinball machine works. Zombis and four-armed (impossible) octpus were obstacles.
Meh.I appreciated the new perspectives on learning, and the smaller chunks of video and assignments (which allowed me to spread the work out over the week).The "Thanks for Learning about Learning" phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module, but became annoying as the closing phrase. of. every. video.Dr Sejnowski's skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me - I suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the TP won't be such a distraction (watching his eyes track back and forth didn't do it for me).
Very good material for high school, college or university students. Not enough for more serious applications such as business people or researchers. Course challenges / Things nor properly addressed: - Relationship of Learning to emotions and meaning. - Skills depvelopment vs Academic learning - What drugs / supplements are good to improve learning, besides doing exercise. - More info about subconscious, emotions and their impact on learning.  - Please do not include links you need to pay / subscribe (NYT)Thks for all.
Interesting course and worth doing. Could be completed in a day or two if you're just viewing the videos and answering the quiz.Positives: The content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about, and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide to.Negatives: First week doesn't add much. The videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrived.Overall, a good primer before moving onto other courses, as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable.
The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animations, etc.) but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course. Barb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resonated with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas. I am contemplating a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done.
There are some very interesting parts to this course, especially those which explain the neuroscience behind some of the techniques. However, it is quite easy and many of the things you will pick up you will already have discovered for yourself if you are an experienced learner or test-taker. I would recommend this course to anyone from 14 to the first few years of college. The female presenter is very good but the male one is pretty bad and it is hard to follow what he is saying.
I enjoyed the simplicity of the Course, the good structure and easy Tests. The interviews with very outstanding personalities in the wide field of learning were helpful and impressive. At the same time, the design of the Course seemed a Little outdated to me. And often the Questions in the Tests did not really challenge my brain to test, if I really understood a subject, because the spoken sentences from the Videos were copied to the answers.Thank you very much!
Many useful techniques and perspectives in this course!Take this course if: you are looking to learn new techniques to improve your time-efficiency and performance in learningDon't take this course if: you are put off by pseudoscientific assertions (an explanation based on the insula being the "fear center of the brain" comes to mind) or interspersion of useful information by neurobiological theories that have no relevance for improving your learning performance
No offense, but watching Dr Sejnowksi's videos was really hard (unable to read the teleprompter correctly, no 'natural' way to talk which made it hard for me to feel interested in what he has to say). The final assignment requires as well a lot of time to be done correctly, which i think isn't worthy. Some good things though, particularly in weeks 1 and 2 . Didn't feel concerned by most of the week 4 part based around taking test (not relevant to my situation)
The first two weeks of the course were amazing, you know more about your mind and understand why "practice makes perfect". But by passing those weeks, course started to deviate from that idea to more theoretical concepts which i thought it was hard to relate. I think the first and last week are the most interesting they present more realistic information and tricks which can be really very helpful.
It was an overall good course with some magnificent inspiration. However I found it a bit basic, and especially in the later stages to much focused on a specific productivity agenda. Also I was at times taken aback by the "one size fits all" approach, which works kind of against kung-fu: the art of hijacking your own negative aspects to work for beneficial outcomes for yourself.
The score could be 4 but I downrate it cause in my opinion this course is a bit hard to follow, cause it combines the scientific explanation of  how the brain works with some tools/tips for learning as a consequence of that scientific explanation.If you feel confortable with neuroscience or newurobilogy  you will enjoy... but if you don't it may be a bit dull or hard to follow
The test taking tips and physical explanations of the brain's processing were fabulous.  I learned that a MOOC is a massive open online course.  Given the number of "MOOCs" I wish educators would help facilitate students selection of the best topics to learn about and help them navigate the self learning.  The world is going to look a lot different a year from now.
Although this course did have some helpful tips and tricks, I also read the book midway through and found I could of learned the same material through the book. So it really depends on how you learn, if you learn better from books, buy the book. If you learn from projects and quizzes, you should take this course online. Overall solid course and helpful tips.
This is a good course and I got to learn a few things from it. Even though, I feel the content could have been covered in a lot less time than it took. But I would still recommend the course because of the huge difference it could make in your life. One piece of advise. Consider the weeks as days and complete it within 4 days. That's what I did.
When the course started it was very interesting. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works. Barbara Oakly was great.However, towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating. Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter.
Very good course, but I did't like how the last week focused on test taking. The course should focus more on 'learning how to learn,' not how to ace a test. In that regard, I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults. Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively?
Very basic information, focused strongly on test-taking strategies.  Nothing bad here, but not really specifically adapted for lifelong learning.  If you're a student and don't feel like you have effective, robust study strategies, check out this course as there are handy tips and tricks and some may be new to you.
The beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some pragmatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the POMODORO technique (excuse me if spelling is wrong). The later portions could have been better although they weren't that bad either. Overall, I learned how to learn!
Good Course, but it did not help me learn anything new. The quizzes take a long time to read the questions and choices, as they are paragraphs on their own. Sometimes the choices feel sort of forced humour and irritate the reader. Would recommend to first/second-year college students and school students only.
Various helpful techniques but I did find the course rather boring, especially the multiple-choice questions and all the "scientific" facts about the brain. It also seems more geared towards high-school or university students than towards the general public, so maybe I was just not in the target audience.
It is an interesting course, however, it focuses a bit too much on current students and test-taking. Learning is not something that stops after graduation and I would appreciate if the authors gave some attention to those who are already done with school, but do not want to stop acquiring new knowledge.
This course was a succinct overview on improving your studying and learning processes. However, for those no longer in school or taking group classes, I struggled to find its applicability.  I will certainly recall ( ;) ) many of the strategies as I take further online classes or study other materials.
I thought this course will be a bit more helpful, there were some good methods I learned like the pomodoro and other concepts I wan't aware of before. Dr. Terry Sejnowski might be very knowledgeable but he can't read a teleprompter and it makes his videos very hard to focus.Overall it was a good course
Til the end of the course it became boring. All the videos recorder by Barbara were of low sound volume, so that it was complicated to listen to. Tests in this course has too many tricky questions, so that for non-native speaker of English it is very complicated to define the correct answer thereof.
Had a few interesting points on the way that the brain works (focused and diffused mode), gave one tip for beating procrastination (pomedoro technique) and stressed out the technique of spaced repetition. Also, enjoyed the idea of using a memory castle for memorising unrelated item list.
Personally for me who had read about neurology, psychology and human behavior. This course does not build a lot on my formal knowledge. However it would be useful to anyone who is interested in learning and curious about brain facts and psychology of learning.
The course is too some extent useful It indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning. One thing I do not like is the testing questions. Some of these questions are poorly designed. Using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them.
Too repetitive. Each session has a useful part (about 20%) and the rest is all beating about the bush with a lot of interviews to shows how efective the methods explained in the course are but that don't provide something really interesting.
I've been enrolled to this course for over a year already. I abandoned it after the first couple of classes presented by extremely boring teachers. I wouldn't say that their way to deliver the message about efficient learning is motivating.
Fascinating overview of the neuroscience of learning and understanding. The practical tips seem more directly relevant to high school and college students, but it's not a huge distraction from the rest of the course. I enjoyed it!
I felt the course was a bit general. I wish the information could have been targeted to fit our individual needs as learners. That would've been a course worth paying for, but this was a nice introduction to learning how to learn.
Great class. Learned a lot of interesting and valuable info. The big peer-graded final, however, 1 of the 3 people to review me didn't bother to score anything, just hit submit, thereby dropping my score to a failing grade!
In general, it gives away some practical advices and techniques on learning and studying, however, half the lessons I found to be slightly repetitive and probably oriented for colleague students mostly.
I really like it. The course was a bit to short, but still I managed to learn few new things. It was definitely interesting plus interviews with well know people is a huge plus. Keep up a good work!!!
It gives you information that we usually already know The techniques are things that most students already use without knowing the technical terms. But worth just going through if you have the time.
I liked it, but I felt like they didn't get very in depth about a lot of the topics. It was hard to take notes because there seemed to be a lot of skimming of subjects and jumping around.
Pretty low level, but has good energy and can give useful all around info. It was lacking in technicality though, it seemed more like a high school lesson than a legit university course.
The course is good enough to learn a few concepts about techniques to improve the learning process. Four hours per week is all you will need to finish it with good grades. Great work!
Too much hype. Maybe because of that I had very high expectations and get disappointed. Concepts were good. Nothing completely new. Not fully satisfied with the way it was presented.
Verbose and lightweight with no original concepts, far too easy to warrant inclusion in this MOOC.  It took me 6 hours in total to complete - play at 1.5 speed to hasten the finish.
The course was ok. It is a little out of date and I would have liked for more practical applications of the learning techniques. I would have liked more techniques for note-taking.
If you have a lot of trouble learning, studying, or testing, this might be really useful.  If you don't, but are looking to take things "up a notch," there's not much new here.
This is a decent course if you are looking for some very general guidelines and concepts about how your brain works to learn things. I find it rather vague, but it's alright.
It was really helpful insight into learning and testing skill.  It shows me a better way to an understanding of how to prepare for a test, and i should help focus on.
I feel a bit disappointed about this course, it was undeniably interesting but my expectations were high since this is one of the most popular courses on Coursera.
Very interesting and applicable advices. But the theory too "empirical" and "metaphoric" for my taste, a little more rigor would not hurt!May 2016 - French student
it is a useful course that give you the right methods of learning and how to  avoid wrong way of learning that we thought it is right but it is completely wrong .
Most of it is good and interesting idea. I think some are general ideas although the course help me recall it better, I still think that they can be briefer.
The course was good but some parts where not able to understand easily, but overall a good experience. Thank you coursera andd the two wonderful professors
A lot of quite obvious material. Bad quality videos and constant repeating "It's Barbara Oakley, thank you for learning how to learn" made me sick =(
It gave a few good advices about learning and introduced some noteworthy concepts, but the videos became quite boring and repetetive after a while.
I like the material of the course, the interviews but I think it is pretty strict with the answer(s) the ask for in some of the first assessments.
Video quality could be improved. Some were distracting, with videos and other media happening while the presenters were explaining a topic.
Too much neuroscience, but it is a useful course for unievsity/college students. It provedes two or three valuable stuying methodology
I did learn things about the way I think and the way I learn. I am an Anatomy and Physioligy student so I appreciated the information.
Interesting learning course. You need to stick to follow the videos (may seem a tedious by moment). Overall, a good average course.
Videos are good and explain the topics very well, however the tests were very tedious and it was hard to concentrate on them all
It is on a very basic level as far as the neuroscience and level of material and for that reason it was not super useful to me.
Worth your time in seeing new things about understanding, how mind works when it is learning, procrastination and memory, etc.
The coding sequences very much spoon feed you the solutions. Good for a way to get an initial grasp on these concepts though.
It is okay.  The instructors need to practice working in front of a camera.  I found that they each came off a little stiff.
Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond.
This subject proved to be very effective for me.I learned how i can use my abilities to doing tasks that seems difficult.
Good start but the material got a little thin in the second half. Would recommend the first 2 weeks to any student
Relevant at few places while not impact-full at other. Examples need to be more comprehensive and understandable.
I learned some interesting Tools about Learning. I would love the course to engage us with more concrete Learning
I found the initial videos very informaive. Then it suddenly chnged the order and  I didnt find a conclusive end
This course is way too much concentrate on studies for students, not well correlate with studies for everybody
It was going because it taught things that I did before such as sleep is very important for our brains.
Well presented, great communication and relevant content. The course was well designed and coordinated.
Nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes, to get you to use the skills
I found this very basic (compared to some other courses I have done). It was still interesting to do.
I learnt a lot of new things about learning how to learn. I now have a different perspective in life.
This is an excellent course . We learn how to learn from this course . All should do it at once 👍
I'd expected a little more Techniques. But what was part of the course, was really well selected!
Very elementary. Also please record the lectures appropriately - I had a hard time hearing you!
I liked the course, however, the instructor needs to be more human less robotic while talking.
This course has helped me find the best ways for me to learn, and I am thankful for that :).
Found it useful. But for people who does not have science background, few terminologies ca
Actually I was expecting something more, but still it was a pleasure to watch this course
Though the concepts and practice exercises, the voice quality of some videos was a downer
The teacher is not very enjoyable to listen to, however the content is very interesting.
This is a quite good training, but videos are aged and a lot of concepts are foregone.
Useful and applicable to daily life, but some habit-forming techniques are intuitive.
Good content, well presented. Just too short, and should provide more content.
Module tests are weak = too easy. would have loved some more depth included
It wasn't I think will be, but it was interesting and I learned so much.
looks good ...lets see how much of help it can be to me Thanks  coursera
For me ro much about how brain works. I was expecting more useful tips.
Interesting, although course content and test questions were very easy.
Too slow, too vague, but you can feel the ideas behind have potential.
boring lectures, maybe much more helpful for high school students.
it's a good course, for learning the basics about learning process
it is good but a lot more citations and examples could be included
One of the best way to maximize the learning with minimum efforts
A good course, but the tests in it are terrible and incompetent
Helped me to focus.Now i can focus on my study  while online
Talking way to slow, other than that I enjoyed it very much.
could have been summarized in a 2 weeks program I guess
the course is not as informative as I expected it to be
Different Techniques to help you learn and concentrate
first two weeks is great, but kind of falls off later
Accessible introduction to basic learning techniques.
Worth doing, but hardly enough content for 4 weeks.
lots of dry theory, not as practical as I expected
there isn't much more helpful information for me.
Nice tips, long for what you get out of it though
it had some useful tips on learning how to learn
Good stuff. I learned some useful techniques
A basic course with a few helpful insights.
Some useful new points. Mostly revision.
it really helps i feel changed already!
Not so informative.Lot of self branding
Quiz answers are sometimes too obvious
Ive learning a lot with this course.
It's good tips for learning, thanks
great course, have learned a lot!!!
nice course but it have more exams
Very interesting but not practical
Found 1/5 of the content useful.
Very easy, but probably helpful
good, but not in-depth enough
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
Good course, very education
good and worth to be learn
Thank You for this course
This is a nice course
It's good till now.
Its really good
enjoying this!
it was alright
it was helpful
Good course.
Very Slow...
Overrated.
I've learned a ton from this course. It encouraged me to look at some of the techniques I've already known from a fresh perspective. One caveat, though, is that I feel the course could've been slightly more practical - possibly having more actionable tasks included, such as "Practice deliberate practice for 25 minutes on a project of choice, then journal about it". Moreover, I feel it didn't cover memory palaces well enough, which I believe is a great tool for memorization. For anyone interested, I'd recommend to look up https://mullenmemory.com for more (which, by the way, I've discovered following Nelson Dellis, who has been interviewed in the LHTL course).To sum up, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more efficiently.People to follow later on:Scott H. Young - https://www.scotthyoung.comNelson Dellis - https://www.youtube.com/user/punknellis14/playlistsAlex Mullen - https://mullenmemory.com (surprisingly not included in the course, possibly due to production date)
To be honest, it's kinda terrible.
Thanks for this great course!2 points to make it better (as per my POV): update it a bit with a new visuals (it feels like studying in the 90's with); the test Q/A's are sometimes too easy and even if you don't know the material you can easily guess (which might create an illusion of competence haha).
I have taken more than two dozen online courses in a wide range of subject. This is an excellent course filled with universal practical skills and insights to make the most of your own learning potential in any subject or discipline. Just as useful are the tools and tips provided to overcome the most prevalent bad habits and ingrained behavior that impede learning. The material is presented primarily through short video lectures (less than 10 minutes) in plain spoken English accessible to high school students yet useful to scholars and life-long learners at any age or level. The lectures are supported with abundant supplemental optional videos from learning experts and scholars along with reading from popular articles and professional literature. The lectures are comprehensively documented with references. My only regret is that I didn't learn what is taught here very early in my academic career.
User friedly style of the lecturers Barb and Terry impacted possitively and enhanced my comprehenssion as well as retention. I even managed to achieve 96% marks. For me, it has been a great course for rejouvenating my memory as well as boosting my confidence. Mahender Khari, London
Its really an amazing first journey with coursera. The content provided through this course was exquisite.i have understood all those key mistakes i make while learning and all those obstacles i face while studying.Mrs. Barbara Oakley [ hats off]
fantastic. the quizzes were really helpful. But some lectures were extended unnecessarily. Like that famous scientist with a big name that babara mentioned that she read the biography.
Very nice explanation
If you're like me, you probably thought that the steps to proper learning were obvious. And in a sense, they are obvious, so you'd be right. Those people who told you to stop procrastinating, start early, and try harder/smarter if you weren't putting in enough effort/reasoning were right. But most of those people who tell you those things only focus on trying to persuade you into doing better. They never tell you HOW to do it better.If you're stuck in understanding the how of learning, this course is great in helping you figure that out (I mean, that's kind of what it's supposed to do considering the title, but take this as a confirmation from an "alumni" of this course. I put the quotes because I'm not sure if that term is appropriate, but humor me for a bit).Adding on to what I said earlier in this review, this course does indeed talk about the obvious in terms of being a good student, but it also goes a step above that by providing details that I never even considered. Now I understand the process of learning better, and because I understand a little better, I've become more motivated in trying new things out. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if you learn noting from this course, this course can help you re-open your mind if it ever felt closed at any point in your life.The only reason why I'm not giving this course a perfect score is because while this course teaches you how to learn, it's hard to confirm if it actually works. Yes, it tests you now and then to see if you actually understand what it's trying to teach, and personally I think it does a pretty good job at it, but I have yet to find out if this applies to other topics that I want to learn. It seems that the course tries to get your feet wet with the learning that you have ahead of you too, but until I actually get to those topics and try to understand them in greater depth, I can't really confirm if these learning methods that were presented will be effective for said topics.But I hope you won't let my uncertainty scare you. While I don't know about how the rest of my learning will go or what it has in store for me, finishing this course has gotten me to look forward to studying them. It's made me more active than I've been in a while, and I can't be more excited than I currently am to tackle new subjects and broaden my horizons.So to close up this review, the last thing I want to say is that I would not waste my time writing this extensive review if I didn't think it was enjoyable or worth the time. For me, it clearly was. In fact, I've never written a review this long. This is a first. Consider me a believer of this course, because I am convinced it did something for me. I don't regret going through any of these lessons one bit. Thanks for reading.tl;dr - If you think you know how to get good at learning, then you probably do, but this course can help you get even better at it because it has details to learning that may not seem as obvious. It was worth my time, and I feel like a better person after finishing it.
Learning how to learn is an important concept that we don't spend enough time thinking about. This course teaches you a bit about the science of learning based on psychological and neuroscientific research, as well as the experiences of educators. It also provides a number of helpful tips that can assist you in understanding and memorizing new concepts in any field. However, I think this course has more "filler" than necessary. Some videos will spend 6 minutes making one or two good points that could be made in a minute and half. Personal anecdotes, redundancy, theories behind why certain techniques in learning work the way they do, etc. contribute to this "filler." It's not that I don't find some of this stuff interesting, but when I start a video, I want to focus on the fresh subject of that particular video and how it will help me learn. The personal anecdotes and theorizing would fit better in the "optional material" section. The redundancy is entirely unnecessary and is actually a bit like "rereading" in a way, which is a point the course teaches you is ineffective. Make your point clearly, then test us to see if we understand it. It does not need to be rehashed throughout the course. Further examples and explanation can be provided in the "optional material" section if people want to read more about it.Secondly, quizzes should be more difficult. They contribute to an "illusion of confidence," which is another concept that the course itself discusses and urges you to avoid. I honestly feel that many of the questions have such common sense answers that I could've skipped several videos altogether and still passed some units. They could be designed better to see if people genuinely understand the perspectives and techniques that this course offers.Despite my critiques that this course would benefit from some sharpening of the lectures, and more difficult questions, I enjoyed it, and am glad I took it. I feel that I have more guidance in how to approach my learning effectively.
This course is a lite and approachable collection of tips on how to work with your brain to learn more effectively. It won't blow your mind with advanced techniques you haven't heard before, but it is a nice succinct overview of what works better and what doesn't work so well. I picked up a few tips and had to sheepishly admit that I was guilty in the past of studying in a less than ideal way (I have a Bachelors degree). I would say this is a particularly useful course for young adults to take as it's not too heavy and is useful in explaining to them how to be more effective and why the techniques in the course work. That is not to say of course, that it is not useful for all ages. I found Barbara to be reasonably effective as a presenter. She speaks a little slowly for my taste, but I sped up the playback speed to 1.25 and that made it comfortable. Her lectures are well thought out and smoothly delivered.I found Terry Sejnowski contributed little to the course however. His explanations were fumbling, muddled and confusing. I found myself reading Wikipedia more often then not to get a better explanation on the concepts he was supposed to be teaching. He just didn't explain them well. He also didn't really explain why he was explaining them at all. The lecture on neurotransmitters was particularly bad. In what way did any of that help me learn how to learn? I think most of his lectures are just not that necessary to the course. I also think Barbara could have done a better job herself. But I understand her wanted to include him as he is an apparent authority in the area and it lends some credibility to her course. I think it's well worth taking and again I think this would be ideal for school kids (secondary) to help instill good practices early and steer them around a couple of easy to make mistakes.
This was a very well prepared and nicely assembled course. Maybe I've read too much on the subject already, but there was nothing fundamentally new to me in terms of strategies or brain mechanics.  I hoped to find something new, because I haven't found "my" strategy yet. However, there were tons of more in-depth information I appreciated and I will have lots of material in forms of citations, references and links I will further explore in the future still. Maybe sone of this will provide a twist or change to something I've already tried and make it more effective. You can definitively see that the creators put a lot of enthusiasm and effort into it.The only thing I really wish they hadn't done was falling into the advertisement trap of proclaiming that some of their techniques are seemingly "easy" or need "minimal effort". I nearly dismissed the course after the "harvest your zombies" video, because it felt so much like cheap advertising and also a bit dismissive of the struggles and efforts connected to this.They always got more realistic relatively fast, especially if you also listened to the bonus interviews with all the experts still having the same struggles that we all face while learning, but it still left a somewhat bad aftertaste.Also the end focussed a bit too much on just explicitely test-taking, which is not what I am facing anymore, but I recognize that lots of people probably came to the course to find strategies for exactly these stituations.In general: they present a lot of nice strategies to try, just don't let them fool you that it will be easy.
I've been struggling with the learning process since high school. Over the years I've initially approached the chance to learn with enthusiasm and determination ("this time it will be different"), only to be derailed by unwavering perfectionism and the steadfast conviction that I can't possible live up to expectations ("if I'm not perfect, then it doesn't mean anything"). I've fled more often than not, taking a fail or missing an opportunity rather than face the possibility of being merely average, or worse. So taking Learning How to Learn was not just about understanding the process of learning from a tactical point of view, but showing that I could follow my goal all the way through to the end. Fortunately Learning How to Learn provides a very supportive environment in which to learn and, importantly, make mistakes, without the whole world come tumbling down. The purpose of the course is not to identify the good learners from the bad learners, but to provide everyone with the chance to learn in a non-competitive way. As someone who has feared learning for a long time, it was incredibly, monumentally important that Learning How to Learn be a place to enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome of it. And that's what the course provided. I'm going to be testing the ideas and strategies from Learning How to Learn over the next few months, leading up to the start of my second year at university. My goal is to focus on the process of learning, not the product (an important point from the course). It's my first small step in overcoming my fear.
This is a very helpful course to improve your learning habits. This is one of the courses I wish I had done when I was a student. It is backed by solid research and is presented in an user-friendly way. It will drastically improve your ability to absorb and retain new material.  The techniques, tips, quizzes, discussion forums, additional reading material, interviews are all very helpful. I enjoyed doing the course and looked forward to each week's session.My only reason for deducting a star is that occasionally they get carried away by the analogies and metaphors in order to explain a concept (a case in point is the module on chunking). And then you are left wondering how do you actually apply it to a real subject - the metaphor is very well done but the real-life example is something that was not clearly explained. That said it is an occasional issue and almost all of the course holds up well. You will find many counter-intuitive ideas (such as highlighting is not as effective as making notes in the margin; exercise and sleep actually help your brain) and useful techniques (such as deliberate practice, interleaving, pomodoro technique to beat procrastination, recalling, spaced repetition etc.) to help your learning.I think school children from 13-14 years upwards of age can grasp much of the course on their own. Younger students may at times may need help from their parents to understand a few of the concepts.
I was skeptical at the beginning but I loved the way the videos were kept simple and ordered (I think). I loved Barbara's eloquent narrations and her voice and style kept me occupied. Great insights from Dr. Sejnowski on human brains, I think I learnt a few terms for a non biology person.On of the reasons I proceeded with the course was to understand the reasons for procrastination and overcome the same. Though the course had taught  few techniques to overcome I feel they scratched the surface of procrastination itself. I didn't do optional videos to know if they have covered bit more over there.Overal the course resonated what I have thought, believed or practiced on how to go about learning something new. Thus, it actually helped me validate my methods plus learnt additional insights on how our brain works and few more techniques to become a better learner. Regarding quizzes, I felt they were too simple and repetitive. Maybe they purposely made it inline with what the course was trying to teach us. At least, they could update the time duration to 10 minutes or so for quizzes/reviews that had 4 to 6 questions. Most quizzes I could complete in  5 to 10 minutes. There were moments I felt so good, particularly, when Barbara touch on simple philosophies, such as, "lady luck favours the one who tries"! Well, I really enjoyed it and many thanks to the entire team who had put it together a superb course.
It's been an absolute joy, navigating my way through this intricately designed MOOC! Week after week, there were numerous different and interlinked concepts, covered in detail with the help of various interviews with learning 'Maestros' across the world. The overall development, observed by me in my overall tendencies regarding the various aspects of learning, have drastically changed for the better! The most prominent concepts - which I can safely recall, test myself and deliver an explanation to anyone interested - are definitely 'Avoiding Procrastination', 'Chunking', 'Two different modes of thinking (Diffuse and Focused)' and 'Techniques used to tackle exam stress and ensuring maximum output'! If I may, I'd personally like to express my gratitude, especially to the wonderfully talented course developers, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, along with the supporting University of California, San Diego, and much needed one to Coursera - to make this wonderful MOOC available for everyone, free of cost! As for a note of recommendation, the research and hard-work went into bringing this course to life seems almost unparalleled... With scientifically proven techniques along with the delivery of these techniques, makes this course a must for pretty much everyone who gets a chance to do so!
Great course. The lecturers are able to group seemingly scattered ideas in a systematic way and gradually tell us the core of learning and introduce relevant techniques. If you are a good learner, you probably can echo with a lot of these techniques which you are already subconsciously applying in your learning process. It of course doesn't hurt to refresh and reinforce those key ideas. If you are struggling at learning, it is good to learn to change your behaviour in learning, although on this aspect the course is still quite abstract and it does require a lot of extra determination and self-regulation to be able to make those changes. For me learning is a combination of techniques and perseverance. Absence of either is detrimental. This course teaches general techniques and you are required to decide your own techniques that work with you the best for a specific subject. Perseverance is sustained by motivation - this is what this course lacks (it does introduce the idea of practice though but how to keep practising?). Why do we learn? What are we seeking in learning a specific subject? Ask these questions and get convincing answers to yourself is key to be able to hold on and not give up halfway.
Summary: Overall this is a course worth taking. It gives you tips and tricks into how to learn backed by scientific evidence. I really liked the discussion of focused and diffused modes as well as how you're supposed to chunk things you're trying to learn int small bits to better understand it.The course covers also a bit of neuroscience and how learning really works in the brain. It was interesting to know that the working memory is very limited while the long term memory is basically unlimited so trying to remember too many things at once just doesn't work. The great thing is that the course provides a lot of supplementary material that you can delve deeper into if you want to know about something. One of the papers cited talked about 10 different learning techniques and it was a revelation to me that highlighting text is actually not efficient in learning. Overall the course was nice, I found the quizzes a bit too close to what was said in the lecture. It might have been better to get a reading assignment that delves deeper into something and then some questions on it.
I came in with my own theories based on my experience only to find there is scientific backing almost everything I have been doing. An example would be dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test. Sure, the horror, or, that's ill advised. However, dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test allows my brain to go to diffuse mode. When I snap out of it or wake up I suddenly know the answer or how to go about reaching the solution. There has not been a single test I've taken where I took a nap and did not score within the top 5%. Everything I learned here will further augment what I know by experience but did not have scientific research to back up. Everything I learned will help me explain to others what it is I do to learn efficiently and how they can go about doing the same thing (maybe not falling asleep on a test ;P). This was very helpful, and includes loads of resources to read and or watch long after you are done to really solidify those chunks. Would recommend to anyone with the drive to learn deeper and better.
I would rate the course 5 stars but for parts about Charles Darwin's theory of evolution."Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the preservation of FAVORED RACES in the Struggle for Life" is a racist work by a masonic and racist man with a family history of dark connections that leads people into mentalities such as survival of the fittest which leads to racist ideas like eugenics, superior races, think Nazism, etc.After completing Learning How to Learn, I highly suggest using the tools to learn more about the following books and their respective subjects:Tragedy & Hooe 101 a shortened version of Carroll Quigley's Tragedy & HopeThe Franklin Cover-Up by John DeCampThe book of Enoch by EnochThe Scriptures, Old & New Covenants (using concordances, dictionaries, and older versions to cross check)As an accountant (statement reconciliation) and former atheist of about 20 years, I know, not think, these subjects are one of the best investments of anyone's time. As was this course :)
I like writing lists and don't like writing texts, so here is my concise +/- list:

+ easy to learn, most of tests are done just using common sense
+ emphasizes importance of simple techniques I already knew (spaced repetition, exercises, sleep hygiene)
+ has some really worth points (focus vs diffuse modes, focusing on process to beat procrastination etc.)
+ lots of new English vocabulary, especially during last week (for non-native English speakers)
+ nice lecturers

- lack of in-depth view; Dr. Sejnowski did some effort on subject, but still. Mentioning neuroscience makes me expect much deeper immersion
- some lack of actor skills (sorry, sometimes a play looks a bit exaggerated)
- some techniques are pretty obvious (like recall)

And, «as the videos specifically discussed», without spaced repetition and practice, everything you learn from this course will be washed out like neurotoxins within a couple of months. So good luck and keep practicing!
This was a wonderful course that has already helped me in remembering things and giving my brain time to find the information that I know I've already placed in there. I ordered the guide for kids and teens and plan to share this with my grandchildren by going through it together. The tools provided were really helpful. Understanding how the brain works and your ability to change your thoughts/life are powerful motivators to learning. I also appreciated the encouragement given by Dr. Oakley throughout the videos. The references, optional videos/interviews were interesting. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (if I could've given it a 4.75, I would have) is because I thought the video quality could be improved/updated and content delivered more smoothly (some parts were obviously being read). However, I would certainly recommend this course to anyone. Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
This course gave a good insight on how to develop the way we learn our current as well as new skills with the perspective on how we can use our brain effectively with respect to learning abilities. Although there are of lot details shared, but there aren't any use case or real life example like if somebody might have used these techniques to achieve success when they eventually failed one or multiple times. I believe theory without experiment is like a glass with a water but still it looks like empty and hence one can't drink it believing it's "empty". I am not sure if the use cases or experiment papers would be incorporated in this course, but honestly I enjoyed every bit of course and I am trying to practice what is preached. Also good that optional materials also gave good insights since those material bought some information closure to experimental methods.
I could have given 5 stars because it is a very interesting and great course with an approach on learning that I discovered. If I mentionned 4 it is just because I think it could ask for pre knowledge or background in education and should be defined like it (sorry for my english, I am french and it was also a course to improve my language competencies :) hidden aim...the fact that we can postpone dates by ourselves is motivating. I have done lot of Moocs (mainly French ones) and it gives me an idea of different pedagogical approaches of this "new" modality in learning. I am currently working on implementation of internal academy for a company and want to change the culture on how to learn today in organization..and society. This Mooc is a kind of link between education and learning in business life. I have particularly appreciated that.  Thank you again!
This course is very interesting. It teaches several and useful study techniques, which are also rather easy to understand and to apply. A feature which I liked very much is the message that, by applying these techniques, also those who are not specially gifted in a field (the "less brilliant") can nevertheless obtain good results. If I can suggest an improvement, is to add more  detailed information about the brain, how it works, how neural cells interact each other and with the other parts of the body, how the brain evolves in the life of an individual, from birth to old age. These information may shed some more light on the brain functioning and may provide a firmer foundation for the understanding and the application of the study techniques outlined in this course. Or these subjects may be covered in another course at a higher level.
I found this to be a great introduction to several learning techniques. I took this course after recently graduating through college, and while some of the material felt like review of tactics I already used, it provided a further look into why specific methods worked. I highly recommend this class to anyone in high school, college or looking to self study. I additionally used this class to become familiar with coursera, and the general environment of MOOCs.the only negative I have about this class is that the additional readings were so numerous it was difficult to choose which ones to look into. If the instructors maybe had a favorites section, I think I would have had better guidance for the readings. However, the readings they provided were numerous and I plan to come back to their lists in the future!
This course's  material is useful. I knew many of things which are pointed here, so there was almost nothing new here. Also, I always was an ace student, so.. maybe this course just wasn't impressive enough for 5 stars.However, it featured many, many tiny tips and tricks, which, if mastered, can vastly improve learning trough the whole life, save time and become more efficient. Great, huh? This course's main material will give you direction and basic, most important tips, which you will remember. However, there are many more nuance things, which may require additional research (memory palace technique, for example).  I recommend this course for everybody, because it, obviously, will benefit everybody who's determined enough to go through this course and take learning tips into practice.
I enjoyed the course very much, it is actually one of the few which I finished. It provides a lot of helpful tips about effective studying. Lots of the material is presented in a metaphorical form which was also fun. Optional interviews are great, so do not miss the chance to view them! The course is both pretty scientific as it relies on scientific data about neuropsychological processes of the mind, but it is at the same time very easy to follow for those with no corresponding background. The only thing is that the tasks were not challenging enough for me, I would enjoy them more if they were little bit more difficult, a bit more brain-racking, though it is surely a very subjective personal impression. I would like to thank all the Learning How to Learn Team for a great course!!!
Very useful information provided in videos that can be downloaded and 
listened to offline, which I found incredibly valuable as I could listen
 to the videos while driving to work. Then I completed the short quiz 
(10 minutes) at work. I could therefore get through the whole course 
without needing to set aside much additional time. I also saved most of 
the additional reading to Pocket, which also enabled me to listen during
 my commute. I thought that this was an excellent course and look 
forward to completing the followup, Mindshift. The only reason I didn't 
give it a 5 was because the videos aren't always edited well (you can 
tell where the cuts are). Also, some of the optional interviews seemed 
contrived and didn't flow very naturally.
I thought this course would be too difficult for me but the method and clarity of explanations gave me more and more confidence and taught me how to better deal with all the information on the course. The biology videos  had to be watched and transcript read and subtitled but overall it was a great and illuminating experience. I re-trained 6 years ago to become a teacher of English and my trainer said I would never have the same relationship with the language again. She was right. And I continue to learn from that fact, it's so much more complex and fascinating and the chunks keep growing! I feel the same way about this course - Learning will never be the same again! And it's a very positive rewarding gift. THANKS to the whole LHTL Team. Avril.
I found this course very helpful. It was interesting to learn that my shorter working memory is connected to my creative abilities and my need for making daily To Do lists is already recommended. Something that I do on my lists is I add short fun tasks that are easy to complete and I tell myself that I can do the fun tasks if I do the more undesirable tasks first. I also find that highlighting things on my to do list is like a little pat on the back for completing tasks and less messy then crossing things off which would then distract me and I would have to rewrite my list so it's neat. I will most definitely apply the tips and tricks I've learned such as writing lists before bed to my day to day and not just for tough subjects. Thank you!
In today's rapidly changing society, in order not to be left out, it is of utmost importance to practise lifelong learning. This course is extremely useful and timing given the global changes. It provided me with useful information and helpful tips for making my learning more effective. I believe that if I practise the tips shared in this course, I would be able to learn effectively, for life. The course was presented in an interesting and easy-to-understand manner. The pace was a tad slow for me as I am only taking two MOOCs. But I find that this pace would be just great if you were taking many MOOCs or if you were not a native speaker of English. I highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to supercharge their learning.
This course was exactly as described, and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach.  The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have, in my opinion, been set up s their own unit, instead of into others, which I found to make it harder to digest.My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end.  I'm sure some learners like the term-project-like assignments (creating pdfs, videos, etc), but from a casual standpoint (ie, I'm not paying for a certificate for this course), I was just relieved to find them to be options -- ones I didn't exercise.   But overall, those two annoyances would not keep me from taking another course from UC San Diego or the instructors behind the course.
Very insightful course that taught me generalized techniques that I can use to learn new things. Some content was very specific to test-taking and high school and/or university students though, which I struggled to find applications for myself, as someone who's employed and doesn't do many tests, but it's the exact reason I'd highly recommend it to students or non-students who will have to take tests for some reason. I really enjoyed Barb and Terry's upbeat attitudes and their attempts to breakdown complex studies into digestible and accessible chunks. In closing, this is a course I wish I knew about when I was in my undergrad as I think the strategies taught would have enhanced my learning and helped me score higher on tests!
A bit of it was a little too focused on students in school (test taking strategies for example) and not good for lifelong learners, which will all need to be these days.  I wish the hate on concept mapping were better explained.  I find it helpful  This course  was helpful in explaining certain ideas like chunking, diffuse mode, and pomodoros.  It helped clarify what spaced repetition is, and what makes it useful (I'd previously only encountered it in relation to  language-learning flashcards).  It also covers some, but not all, the benefits of note-taking.  I would have liked to see the instructors's views on visual note-taking, but that was beyond the scope.Overall, I wish I had encountered this decades ago.  It's brilliant.
The information contained was very useful and immediately applicable.   I felt sorry for the professors during the videos, as they looked very uncomfortable in front of the camera and was sometimes a bit difficult to listen to as they didn't seem to have comfort reading the teleprompter.  The information of how our brains function in long term memory building and understanding procrastination in more of a neuro/chem response was greatly appreciated.   Techniques provided were all immediately applicable and can easily be expounded upon.  I am recommending this course to anyone intimidated by STEM. Also recommending for several girl scout troops.  Thank you for the opportunity to audit this course and learn deeply from it.
What struck me the most was the fact that some of the concepts that are taught in this course are things a lot of people are already doing on a subconscious level. It really helped me look at things like this from a different perspective.While you could argue that some of the examples and metaphors that  are used by Dr. Oakley are a tad childish for older students, they get the point across very well.The book pretty much covers the course material and in that sense, I don't consider it a necessary purchase. Having said that, it helps to read through it to help you solidify the things that are taught in this course.Thank you to everyone that helped for these life long lessons and sparking my interest in neuroscience!
Learning How to Learn is an excellent course for people who want to learn better, especially students.The materials covered in this course are interesting, and the instructors are able to present them with analogies that help me understand them easier. While the knowledge and advice given by the instructors may not apply to everybody, there are sources that link to research concerning them at the end of each video, so you can easily check their credibility yourself.The best thing about this course for me is the amount of extra reading and interviews provided. They not only extend what I learn from this course, but also help build the bigger picture of what I learned and how I can implement them in real life.
This course is overall nice and pedagogic. I am not giving it 5 stars because it is highly oriented to "scholar learning", meaning that you have class mates learning the same subject and will face an exam at the end of the course. However, in my view, most of the learning in life occurs out of a scholar environment. Even during my PhD --which still is an Academic environment--- all learning processes did not involve exams or even classes. Today more than ever we have the opportunity to learn by ourselves --e.g. through the web--- and without everything being about exams. This is a key feature that this course missed. Nonetheless most of the insights learned can be transfered to such non-scholar situations.

Great, concise course with some very solid and well-founded recommendations on how to improve your studying and acquisition of new subjects. Also great advice on test-taking techniques. The introduction to memory techniques is very light, but it really is a really rich and detailed subject in itself so it's understandable that they didn't dive too deep. Some recommendations for additional learning for memory and advanced reading techniques would be a valuable addition to the course though.Overall I highly recommend this course. Barbara is an excellent and very likable instructor and the lessons and learnings are well-sourced and easy to follow. I'm already using the techniques and seeing good results.
I learnt a lot of things from this course, which I began to use some techniques covered in this course. When it came to projects, it was encourage to use different formats (eg. videos, presentation, etc), which you had to download in other to review it.  The problem I notice is that certain projects created I wasn't able to open them because of the file type. I think if you are giving projects it should be a link (to a site/google doc, etc) and not a download file, as every reviewer may not have the program/software to open such files. Or you should have the option to skip the review instead of flagging the project, (because its not the fault of the person who created the project) .
To be honest in my review I would have to say that I learned a few key idea from this course (such as the distinction between focused and diffuse mode, emphasizing the importance of exercise, and a few others), while I had already realized and applied some of the things by myself (and were happy to see them confirmed here).I can completely understand why the course has been simplified to an extreme degree. This makes it easy to understand for almost everybody and is more inviting for all people to continue learning with the course and benefit from it (and it is clear the course is aimed at everyone). But I felt sometimes the oversimplification came at the cost of more needed detail.
this very helpful course especially for the prep school students and also it can be useful for the college students as it's contains a lot of basic facts about our brain and how it works during studying. Also the nature of ourselves while we are studying and how to control the bad habits of studying. you learn how to overcome frustration during studying and how to prepare for the exams. what is the most common and important mistakes we are making while w're preparing for the exams. it was very informative and very basic. but not enough college student as a medical student. i hope it will help me in the future to build good habits and commitment in studying. thanks a lot
(Four and a half stars) I think this course can be valuable to anyone who likes learning... or, more importantly, anyone who *doesn't* like it because it's tough (you might find it surprisingly addictive after you try out some of the methods covered here). The instructors have done a very good job of boiling down scads of information into a handful of essentials. I admit I was annoyed that some of the quiz questions were more focused on whether I'd memorized a specific metaphor than the information that the metaphor represented, but, overall, I found this to be very accessible and, because it is about the methodology of learning, itself, very worthwhile.
This course is useful stop before you start any other, however it is geared more towards students and people who study for long periods of time during the day, rather than working people who need to make do with shorter schedules. This is not immediately clear from the course description. In any case, you will learn some very useful techniques applicable day to day. Some of the content does boil down to tried and tested 'sit with it' method. Tests sprinkled throughout the course were a bit underwhelming, in terms that its mostly about picking an answer and not enough of chance to put learned techniques to practice, such as free form recall of lessons.
I landed up reading the book that this course was based on and I feel it did an excellent job condensing the concepts from the book into an easy to absorb fashion.  I plan to use many of the recommendations this course made and already found the lesson on the diffuse mode helping my more creative endeavors (made my Best Man speech much better when I just let my mind wander first!).  However, while I found the HW assignments made this course easy to complete which is likely the goal, I'm wondering if the course could be more creative in providing assignments that really help the students practice to absorb the concepts for this book for the long term.
The concepts and techniques in this course are very helpful, and I appreciate that multiple approaches and techniques are shared - learning isn't a "one size fits all" situation and I found that, while some of the techniques suggested have not worked well for me in the past, other techniques from the course have really opened up my understanding of my own learning process.My only complaint about the course is the quality of the videos. I'd love to see the course updated with less errors and sound drop-outs from the recordings. Perhaps one of the students who has benefited from this course, and also has video editing skills, could help out!
It is a journey of one's own inner self as experienced throughout the years of compulsory education and later during the life-long studies. One gets to know oneself better and think about improvements s/he can make instantly. I downloaded the pomodoro timer to my Mac and realized it's time to fight the zombies who help in retaining my bad habits of losing time web-browsing or using too much of the precious will power for trying to start learning anything.I will definitely stick to studying the optional material as I have time having finished a project of my life at work. I will miss both Barbara and Terrence and their fun way of teaching.
An essential primer before starting MOOC. Developing the right attitude and understanding how to learn, has undone years of bad habits and perception that it's not possible to learn difficult subjects. And yet, Within 3 months of taking this course, I have dabbed in Game theory, Big Data, Psychology at work and other diverse courses. The sessions are informative, not only on the theoretical aspect of learning, but also the physical aspects of the brain that help us learn. The tips and techniques I learned have helped to create regular habits and practices for learning, learning broadly, building the blocks for more in-depth learning.
It took me quite a while to complete this course! YES, I have just completed and found it very useful to make the most of your time and try to learn on your own. One of my goals this year was to take the initiative and take a MOOC to see if I could learn something on my own time. Despite taking long time to achieve due to mainly my own habits and procrastination, I believe this course is a very helpful tool if you are to make the most of your studies regardless of the subject and avoid relying in the classrooms just like I did.Note: Not sure this was the case although the videos on mobile app were a bit low volume.Thanks!!
My profession makes me to constantly learn and practice new things, most of the time I end up in panic mode.This helped me to justify some of the processes I am already following which I didn't know the actual purpose (Chunk -  for example is how I always work) and learned new things which I could motivate myself to learn better.The test was a bit boring after week 2, which could reduce the number of questions.  Overall it was worth spending my time on this course. I have skipped some of the interviews which I would come back and visit later. I hope these interviews could be edited and inserted in each relevant topics.
Simple techniques that came naturally to you as a school student have been conveyed in this course in a much more scientific and interesting manner. The instructor does a great job of keeping you addicted to the course. The techniques learned can be applied anywhere starting from your day to day activities to learning that skill that has long been on your bucket list.Don't think twice ... If you have trouble completing other courses, take this one. You ll finish this course and all subsequent courses you take up. Thanks to University of California for providing such a great course and Coursera for bringing it to us.
I really enjoyed this course and it was truly helpful to me. Although English is not my native language, I could easily follow the material and the amount of time one has to invest is quite low. Of course, many things taught in this course are quite common knowledge (like exercise and sleep is important etc.) but learning about WHY these things matter and what our brains do respectively in these moments was new to me. However, something I got to criticize are the quiz questions. They are often too easy or even unserious. Anyway, maybe this is on purpose to stimulate certain brain parts to feel better - who knows?;)
Excellent way to revisit/rethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it. While unquestionably a boon to students, as an adult (past middle age), I took away many important and unexpected tips, techniques, and perspectives. Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Testing, it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I'd known that material when I was a student. One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self-testing to assist with day-to-day, non-student procedures and learning situations. Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence.
I thought this course was really helpful to understand the meaning of learning as well as learning how to learn better. Even though it seemed quite boring at first, it really wasn't when you jumped into the course and just finished before the deadlines. The woman has a very nice and easy to follow way of speaking, which makes it easier to understand the learned material of this course. Also, using a lot of metaphors (e.g. zombies) made it easier to follow/understand/remember the learned material. In conclusion, I would really recommend this course to other students who don't know exactly how to learn.
This course is an eye-opener. It should be made mandatory in learning and education circles. Barbara Oakley is an amazing person and kind lady whom shares candid experiences of her life. As a non-native speaker I do have slight difficulties to understand when she speaks but the scripts have been very helpful.  Dr. Sejnowski is a man who knows his stuff, his confidence is reassuring as he makes a complex subject into learnable bits. As a person with Biology major the lessons bring back warm memories and have given me a new connection to my careers a Corporate Learning & Development professional.
A beautifully structured course that I enjoyed very much. All the information presented in it was packaged in an easy-to-comprehend manner by both the instructors. An added bonus - the bonus interviews and extensive resources (most of which I still need to finish) add on re-emphasize the points made in the video presentations. I have started applying the techniques taught in this course and I am sure with practice I will be able to gain a better hold on those techniques and improve my learning. Thank you both Barbara and Steve! It was a pleasant experience taking your MOOC. :-)Best Wishes,Swati
I thoroughly enjoyed the course from start to finish based on the following:1) The simplicity of the program from something that could be difficult to explain2) The content and delivery were properly presented3) The tools shared were easy to model even though a bit technical4) The pre-tests or assessments including the final test were greatly helpful in consolidating the entire learning5) Well done indeed Barbara & Dr Terrence for a great Job done! Bravo!!!! Currently enrolled on Mindshift and so far it's solidifying some of the learnings from this course and am enjoying it as well. Thank you!
It is well designed course and it's actually the first online course I completed. The only thing that I didn't like is the fact that this course is unneccessarily long. If you like I do, have more time at hand, this course can be completed in less than two weeks. I understand that this is done to accomodate more people with different background and time schedules. Also, the right answers to quiz are too obvious most of the time. Other than that, this is a great course and it must be taught in elementary schools. Thank you, Mrs. Oakley and Mr. Sejnowski and San Diego University!
The course is very good and useful for teaching students how to better learn and understand the material they are dealing with. One drawback, however, is that it focuses excessively on test-taking and methods of succeeding in an undergraduate degree rather than a career. It would be nice and interesting to show how the techniques being presented can also be useful outside of class. not just by examples related to great people in various scientific fields, but also by more general parallels. Otherwise, it is a very good course to help combat anxiety and procrastination.
Having doubts about being able to study and retain information is what brought me to this course. It was one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I've ever had. Barbara Oakley has an authentic, non judging style and clarity of communication I can aspire to. The quizzes were fun and tough enough to check that I actually did listen and read the content. Highly recommended if you have any doubts about your ability to learn or want tips for studying. The last star not awarded is only because I think it could do with an update or Mach II :) Thank you for this course.
For an online course, it's pretty good and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to spend their time being educated about learning and how to make yourself an effective learner, as well as, why you use those techniques - I already knew that spaced repetition was the best method and that sleep was important, but I only really understand HOW important until this course. I also did learn some new techniques for learning and, in particular, test-taking, which has been a weakness of mine. Please take this course - it will definitely benefit you in some way.
I enjoyed doing this course very much. Barbara was very good in keeping me interested and I missed her when she wasn't doing the lecture. I especially loved the optional interviews, they brought a new element to the course, almost like a visiting lecturer of sorts. The recall questions or polls in between each video was also good. Over all the course flowed smoothly and I learned a lot  from doing it. Time well spent. Thank you both for your hard work and the time you put into making such a useful tool for the world. Blessing in all your future endeavors
I truly enjoyed the lectures and the material and I hope it will help me whilst trying to learn new things, subjects, more deeply in the future.I found the tests a bit too easy though - patterns can be recognised, helping us with the answer -- creating the illusion of competence :)I want to learn more and more deeply on this subject and some aspects of it - memory and so on, from a scientific perspective -- maybe the course could dig deeper, or I might just look for more info elsewhere.Thank you to both Professors and the team of people involved.
This course is very helpful and practical. Especially the opinion that we should focus on the process rather than the product makes great and obvious change to me. I now gradually apply myself in one thing and void to think finish it soon. But  some material of the course make little relationship and I do not know what should I do actually. Such as the four phases about "procrastination". I think if it can offer an exact example to show how to deal with them will be better. In stead, the course only make a little further explanation on the "cue".
I never learned how I can learn better, So this the course which tells how to learn better with different techniques. Most of us think that learning new subject matters(out of our own branch of study ) will unnecessary burden us. But, how important is to learn new subject's like Learning How to Learn, which improve our life. It is very important in this dynamic world to study different subjects and interrelate them to do better things. MOOC are very helpful to learn wide verity of subjects from experts.All the Best, don't think take the course.
The material was nicely presented and easily understandable. They made an effort to make the lessons vivid and rememberable, though sometimes it could have been a little less repetition. After each module, there was a little quiz to test yourself, and often enough you were asked to think about situations in which you were encountering the situation described in the lesson. The weeks lessons are not too much, I actually 'raced' through the material in two sessions of 2 hours each. I liked it and think will be helpful in the future. Thanks!
Good course with some very interesting techniques/facts about how we know the brain to learn new information.

Barbara Oakley does a good job of presenting. Terry Sejnowski has some 
valuable information too, but his on-camera awkwardness was a bit 
distracting from what he was communicating.

Course is very focused on college students, but the information is very 
much still valid for all others looking to optimize their learning of 
new subjects.

Was it worth my time as someone working in the tech industry? Definitely.

Recommended.
With this course I could get an interesting look at how our brains work, various study methods and how to make the learning experience more fluid and intuitive. The content is presented in an approachable manner, although sometimes it felt like the videos dragged on for simple concepts. The assignments felt oversimplified, almost unnecessary, they definitely didn't help much in terms of retaining the information. The interviews presented at the end of each module where very interesting and a good complement to the main content.
I found this course quite useful for gaining a basic understanding about learning and how to be more efficient in my studies. It would be great with a part II with maybe a more in-depth knowledge of learning or simply more tips like the ones tought in this course. I also find the two professors teaching the course to be really good at conveying the concepts that they were teaching which is really important, this made this course both very informative and easy to understand(and at times entertaining). Thanks for a great course.
Good followup to the Learning how to learn course. I liked the pace, the visual approach to explaining the concepts and the quizes. To make this course really great please try and bring a lot of the content from the optional interviews into the main course and adding quiz questions will ensure benefits from key items like Adam Khoo's advice on obsolesence: "Make yourself obsolete before the world does". I am concerned that a lot of the really powerful stuff is in the interviews and many might not spend time reviewing them.
I found the course really helpful. It helped me in getting the pace to take up learning. One major issue I found in people , who  procrastinate is their touch is lost and they don't to put up more effort or move out of comfort zone. Adding that also as topic in this course, importance of continuous learning will guide them. Overall course was really helpful.Quiz was repetitive- Adding case study of any comprehensive reading to learn and solve, followed by, story telling would be best to add to the course assignment.
This course helped me with my procrastination roadblock. I learned new idea of practice repetition over time and interleaving which helped me form chunks in my memory and master tough subjects/skills. I also learned about analogy and metaphor and how to tap into the visual center of brain which I hope will increase my memory power and help me learn more skills/subjects I want to learn, since learning is something that is perpetual. Thank you for this course and Coursera for providing such courses for free to learn.
Before start taking this course, I was aware of some of the concepts and principles explained in the course. But in that well organized order: I think it's more beneficial to every one who wants to study in the right way.I want to thank all the people who participated to make this course available to all the learners across the world, starting with Coursera, Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, and finally McMaster University and University of California San Diego.thanks for helping us learning how to learn.
I enjoyed the videos and material. They were to the point and practised what they preached by using  metaphors and analogies like zombies and octopuses. The retrieval practises also helped me retain the material better. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the context in which the course was in. There was a focus on test-taking in week 4 which was not relevant to me as i am a working adult. However, I could see how some of the tips would be useful in my work. Good job, guys! Very useful and I appreciate it.
Very good course, would highly recommend to anyone trying to learn any subject. All the information given applies to anything you would want to study not just math and science. Includes great tips and advice, would highly recommend reading the book "A Mind for Numbers" as well, it does a great job reinforcing the material. Lectures on the structure of the brain seem a bit forced and almost out of place though I did see the relevance. They were not integrated very well into the overall course in my opinion.
It touches on many very useful and interesting concepts and I am very happy to have gone through it. As an initial overview it's excellent, but you really have to dive deeper into the subjects yourself to get everything out of it. For example, the course briefly discusses techniques like the memory palace, but you are not given any clear guidance in how to really use them and definitely have to do more research on this yourself in able to do it effectively. But overall, really nice and useful course!
Dr. Oakley is very easy to listen to, and her pleasantness allows for smooth understanding and retention of information and important points. I've taken away many helpful tips on improving my learning abilities and look forward to applying them to my upcoming degree. The addition of extra reading material and interviews with professionals was also full of interesting points and provided me with new insights and pointed me in new directions. I would definitely recommend this course to others!
This was a very concise & thorough class on learning and how to utilize it in your studies. They focus on describing the methods as valuable for science nad math, but as a designer I don't see the argument behind limiting to those subjects. They identify flaws in our natural studying practice and point to reserach in the neuroscience to help explain ideas behind the improved understanding. It was simple to do and gave me new perspectives on learning. It's worth the 4 weeks they set up.
Great course with plenty of helpful insights into the learning process.I thought that the tests were useful in implementing the recall technique cited as part of the course material. If I could make any suggestion for the improvement of the course, it would be further models for the implementation of techniques mentioned throughout the course. Otherwise I look forward to working them out myself for further study as part of lifelong learning. Many thanks to Doctors Oakley and Sejnowski
I would put five stars to it, if the fourth week wasn't so focused on testing. The learning process is much more wider than this, and It felt that after all this great interviews with people who accomplished certain level of learning ability these paragraphs about going through tests felt out of place. Nevertheless I found some ideas that can be helpful to fight procrastination and once again I read a proof that we are capable of building better version of ourselves every single day.
Fantastic course, presented in a very accessible & engaging (& memorable!) format. Barbara has a unique charisma that makes it feel as if you're chatting over tea with your sagacious Aunt. That being said, the course was not particularly challenging. It was more like a structured youtube playlist of casual, inch-deep videos. Which is fine considering they are purposed to give you skills & practical tips, not fill you will knowledge. If you go in expecting this you'll leave satisfied.
The true test of a productivity course is how much of an impact it actually had on your life. So, writing a review a few weeks from now will be the most logical thing to do, once I incorporate the teachings in my routine. However, I enjoyed the course, learnt a lot of new things and it provided a morale boost. My only complaint would the quality of the quizzes - they were poorly designed and questions were often repeated! But for 12 hours, you do get a condensed dose of learning!
Thank you very much. I learnt a lot from this course. I apply the activities in my real life and they help me a lot. Although, it could have been better if the videos were a bit more detailed. I completed this course in two weeks. So, it wasn't like a 4 month course. I was slightly disappointed that it was so short and less detailed. But, overall it's very good. I like the idea of people helping other people to understand how they should train their mind to learn and remember. :)
After 10+ years of no formal education I chose this course to get back into learning. I'm very happy with the course content and after having my speakers break midway through the course, happy that the subtitle option allowed me to watch Barbara and the graphics whilst still learning what she had to say which the transcript wouldn't have done. I would certainly recommend people getting back into study do this course first. Barbara and Terry, Thanks for teaching me how to learn.
On the positive side, I enjoyed taking the course. It is well suited for high school and first year college students, and I think that the mechanics of the course are well presented. That said, I also feel that the course could be re-structured to remove the emphasis on being a student, and concentrate on the principles of how to learn effectively, that anyone, of any age, would use.  as a mature adult, I found the last week's content less informative and almost disengaging .
INSPIRING course! It gives so many great advises on how we should learn more efficiently. People should practice their diffuse mode by practicing regularly and continuously. Professor Oakley has mentioned several ways to avoid procrastination. I have to admit I usually have this problem and hope that Pomodoro can help me reduce the habit. Keep concentrated on a subject, while taking good rest can not be overestimated. Wish those who have taken this course can learn from it.
Good one!Few areas that can improve:1. Visual representation of concept, that can easily stick to mind, when they are being described-like many courses, host can cover a part of window in corner. 2.Summarized slides of each week, so that people can review and refresh. 3.Ease and spontaneous presentation - in multiple interviews the host describes with ease and spontaneity, but when she speaks to camera its effortful expression, that gives an impulsive push to the concepts.
This course was informative, light-hearted, and brief.  Prof. Barbara Oakley shows enthusiasm and spirit, which livens up the material.  Prof. Terrence Sejnowski is less fluid in front of the camera, but his scientific knowledge--the precise explanation of how Oakley's concepts work--is uncanny.  I would love to see professors Oakley and Sejnowski produce an even more polished version of this course.  I learned a lot and raced through the lectured thru sheer enjoyment.
my word can't even describe how i'm thankful of what I've learned, my journey at University jus begun, and those mental tools that I've learned are extremely going be helpful to rest of my life, many problems used to stop me and interrupt me from learning new subjects , thanks to this cours tht's problem solve, I' can now learn any think I wants easly and with no difficulties and in short time. moreover the professors did a great job to influenced us, thanks Coursera.
It is very helpful course for almost everyone,  I think the main pattern is : define an learning activity(memorize), explains how the brain works( create connections, and vampire destroy connections), how to make the brain work better( spaced repetition), how should you do ( arrange the memorize in time spaced fashio 1,2,3,5,8).   I would practice all these techinique in daily life and really open the door for me the know more about cognitive psychology.   Thank you!
This was my first course I did on coursera. I very much enjoyed it. Even if you think you've already got your learning nailed down, you will pick up little things of this course that will help you learn even more efficiently. You could decide your on pass because all the material was online which was very pleasant. The MOOCs were very clear, and the little quizes at the end of the videos gave you direct feedback if you understood the discussed material of the video.
Content: A couple of simple tips and tricks that can definitely help people to learn better and faster. I personally discovered the "Mind palace" technique which I trust can help me a lot, so thanks !Form: Lectures well prepared, and the combination of ideas/slides is rather well made.Sometimes some videos could be shortened as the concepts are not really hard to follow. Some more practical examples could be used in the material.Thanks for this teaching material :-)
Great course.  Demystifies the learning process. The course taught several new techniques that I've already started applying to my own learning, and I'm confident this will make a big difference.  The design of the course (short videos, quizzes, range of content) is structured to help you retain the knowledge, and it is pretty easy to complete. (Of course, you will want to not only complete the course but put these techniques into action!) I did the free version.
it's a very nice course i gain a lot of experience i am sure it will change the way of learning for me but in my opinion i had a little bit of trouble about the chunking section on how to apply in real life i get the understanding and the practice but i feel that some thing is missing but again maybe it from my side .and again its a wonderful course thanks for every one that has been a part of this course and helped that this course came to life for other people
I've learned about this already from the book Your Memory. However, I believe this course has been a great refresher and I've even learned a few more new things as well.It's amazing how some of the techniques taught here seem childish (make acronyms, imagine/ visualize w/ humor, etc), but are underestimated, overlooked, and ignored.I recommend every person who wants to improve work ethic to take this course as to form a foundation to their learning structure.
It is always helpful to review good study habits. A lot of the
information in this class is intuitive, but after years of studying we
sometimes need to be reminded of what works, and see solid studies behind what
we have intuited.  It also debunked some several popular erroneous
theories on what works when studying.  If
you’re looking for verification on what works and what doesn’t this is the
class for you. Why waste any more time doing what doesn’t work.
The instructors should include a video on 'why we forget and how we can fix it'. This will reinforce rest of the study material of this course.Whenever there was a follow up question after a video, it was not completely visible on the screen given the size. It is technical issue which can be fixed by reducing the font size/increasing the screen size so that every word is visible from left to right. It will eliminate scrolling left to right & right to left.
Many thanks to the Lecturer.This lecture is very useful and makes me able to learn more efficiently.A minor critique of mine: Introduction part or the first week lecture seems not coherent with the final part. The week four lecture is narrowed to "taking test techniques" while since the start I expect that the lecture will cover broader techniques in mastering certain skill like: studying, playing guitar, doing office activity, etc (as explained in week1).
The course is very interesting, we already know some of the tricks but we might not know, why a trick can help us, and the given course provides the answer to the same. It is way better than binge-watching series on Netflix as you gain a new perspective and oh well, the teaching is pretty interesting, so drop what you are doing and learn "how to learn" I will try to apply all the useful information given in the course and will update about progress.
I think this is a fantastic course. It was helpful to get insight into my learning process and tips for improving my learning curve, offered material I can share with my ESL language students, and offered ideas on how to optimally present learning materials I develop for my program. Simple but detailed presentation. Clear illustrations and great metaphors that help you grasp concepts, and quizzes to test that you really have grasp the material. Top.
Although instructors mention quite useful techniques, there is no magical or very surprising ones. Personally I had already know many of them. I appreciate the effort, especially of Prof. Barbara. I mostly recommend this course to unexperienced learners about learning although rest can learn some things too. I only check a few optional readings and did not go over all but I think these provide much more detail and very valuable in this respect.
The course is very well structured and provides valuable advice for effective learning. It should, however, be noted that the concepts discussed are rather basic, so anyone who is already very familiar with the topic will probably not hear too much new things in this course. Nevertheless, if one wants to integrate various learning techniques more into one's daily life, I would still recommend this course even to the more advanced learners.
Enjoyed doing the course, really liked the way it was presented. Lots of the content and tips seemed useful and will definitely try them out, but it's difficult to objectively assess their efficacy or if they were based on a specific, and perhaps contested, understanding of learning (for example seemed to be quite strongly based on neuro-biology). Pace of learning seemed a little too slow for me. Would still recommend the course to others.
This course covers some interesting topics and may very well help you better understand what you already know.  For me, it was a bit slow to start but gets better as the lessons progress.  It solidifies some ideas and methodologies that you may not have been to sure about when going about your own studies and learning new things.  I would recommend this course to everyone, unless you really aren't learning new things every so often.
Really loved this class! I am a pre-med student and when I took this course I was studying for my MCAT exam. There are so many aspects to this course that cross over to the psychology section on the exam, however I do think that the most valuable information in this course is the practical application of how to specifically refine and improve my focus in learning and my personal study sessions. Dr. Barbara Oakley is definitely
Overall, I thought this course was designed well, and did a good job of communicating serious information while staying mostly light.  I think the professors could use a little more experience presenting this sort of thing, as some of the videos were kind of awkward, but this is a new style of teaching so I don't really fault them.  I would recommend this course to most people who have an interest in how the human brain works.
Good course, helpful as well as entertaining, with interesting information.I wish if it had more techniques and less abstract information, or the described techniques were  explained and applied with examples on the videos, rather than talking a lot about theories and researches, as I found some of the videos were a bit boring, when I needed more explanation on the tips and techniques themselves.Helpful tips though.Thank you!
I was a bit dubious about the course to start with, and thought it might be too easy, too full of common sense, but in the second week I felt I was learning things, and boosting my ability to learn and focus, which is so important today. I'm considering further study to help me find interesting work, so this course has really helped to get me on the right track to study again, with a bit more confidence and method. Thank you!
Would give a 3 1/2 stars. This course if very simple and light. Have wonderful insights that help with time management, memorization, being efficient and becoming a better learned. If you have extra time and would like to improve upon your skills, I recommend to take this course. Compared to other courses available, this is one of the simplest course out there and requires around 30-45 minutes a day of video watching.
The Course is very well laid out. relevant subjects have been covered and all the concepts have been well explained. I'm presently looking at a prospective career transformation & as part of that transformation, I shall be undertaking a few courses & certifications. I wanted to 1st do this so that I can study better than I've done during my students days. Thanks to the team of instructors, specially Professor Oakley!
The course contents, the execution of content delivery, the study materials provided, the interviews conducted - everything is excellent as far as the student's point of view. As I am also a faculty member, my suggestion is that, if the curriculum is going to be revised, let there be a coverage on fast reading techniques, and on memorizing techniques. Also, in the quizzes, the obviously wrong answers can be avoided.
A lot of the useful new information about the way you can learn how to learn. The only thing, I found extremely distracting the way one of the lectures was reading his lecture, quite bitty and without much flow. As a not native english speaker, I struggled to focus and understand those particular videos. Otherwise, I very much enjoyed the whole course experience! Thank you for creating it and sharing your knowledge.
I realized that I have been using some of these techniques for better learning - sometimes. Now that I am aware I hope I will put efforts to make these into habits. However, I also feel that sometimes all these points may not be valid, for e.g.  if you have exams on consecutive days without break, I find it better to sacrifice sleep rather than showing up for exam without revising the important sections of course.
I took this course as a preparatory course based on my intent to invest more time in the Coursera course catalog. In addition to providing useful tips and practical study habits and techniques, the lessons also provides insight into brain function and specifically those techniques which help the brain register and maintain the information it absorbs. I found this course to be informative and useful in application.
Interesting course that not only teaches some good learning strategies but also discusses the neurology of learning. Very useful and although I wasn't thrilled with the presenters, they did a good job. What made the course particularly interesting were the bonus interviews with various people who had accomplished some pretty incredible learning feats. I learned quite a lot from this module and I am glad I took it.
It was an interesting course if you have never researched or informed yourself on the topic of learning and procrastination. While a lot of information was not new to me, the scientific background was very interesting to learn about and helped me understand and remember the information better. While there is definitely still a chance to improve the video quality and production it was a fun and interesting class.
Very good course and amazing intro to what is a growth mindset. Teachers are very good and refreshing. They provide good techniques to look at a problem from a different aspects. I also very liked the story of the teacher of the course as I find it very aspiring. It shows us that we set our own limitations in terms of knowledge but if we can give dedication and commitment to learn we can almost achieve anything.
This course is very useful for me. Its taught me how to release my stress. After this course, i know how to face my working when I in stress in future. Besides that, i will also try to use the Paradomo technique to solve the problem. And also I will read and familiar all the task guidelines before I'm start a task. in additional, this course is very amazing as its let me more understanding about human brains.
I enjoyed this course. It seemed to me that it focused more on younger students, not older students like myself. The topics still apply to students of all ages, but it's not likely that when I'm learning something new at work that there will be a study group or other things available to school students. I'd recommend it to others because there are a lot of good points and techniques for students of all ages.
If YOU want to revise what learned during childhood the basic concepts taught by teachers about studying and if you forgotten these mini sets with your work schedule or just don't know what are best ways. JUST DO THE COURSE. And complete it with calmness and with in time according to comfort but not too long, it will definitely leave a mark on your life if made into practice.As said by mentor,HAPPY LEARNING
Very good & educational course, teaches you how to learn & understand new subjects, skills, tackle stress, procrastination & much more. Wish i had come across this when i was in school or university my life would have been much easier. Anyways will use these lessons in my life henceforth. recommend everyone to take this course, Teachers are very good & the pace of the course & structure is also well put.
Good course on how one could improve one studying. It emphasizes a lot on the 'no pain, no gain' mentality. Many techniques are mentioned and are very helpful. Some may find this to be a bit redundant since you may already been doing lots of the things they are talking about in the video. Nevertheless, it is a very interesting course. Would recommend the book by Dr.Oakley since it is a lot more detailed.
I learned so much from this course. It was probably the first course where I actively and deliberately  tried to follow steps of new information as I learned it. So very helpful and simple when broken down to digestible methods, techniques and language. Thank you professors for such a useful and interesting course! I will constantly review this information over and over again. "Practice makes permanent."
The pomodoro, the emphasis on 4 working memory slots and the supplemental videos with SMEs around memory palaces and focus learning were a big help.I also appreciated the focus on how to combat your zombies and work on procrastination were very helpful as well as the focus on the law on serendipity.I also liked the emphasis on testing yourself with questions and recall as a way of mastering the material.
Although I haven't learned much which was extremely new to me, the course itself is a great way of gathering all of your knowledge about learning in one place (that being said, 'chunk' it) as well as learning new techniques and intersting facts about the process of learning and the brain itself. With all of its bite-sized lessons and friendly atmosphere, I think this course is perfect for summer break.
This course was very interesting and provided lots of advice for 
studying and learning. I bought the companion book, "A Mind for 
Numbers", which I found pretty useful as a complement (though is not 
strictly necessary!). I recommend this course to anybody interested in 
how to learn effectively, but specially to students in college or 
university -- they are the ones who can gain the most out of it.
I am just over half way of this course, but already convinced that this is the best introduction to MOOC's  I could dream of. Not only is the subject clearly explained by Barbara Oakley and her team, the way your progress is measured and presented helps students to stay on track. I would have given five stars if the MOOC offered more formative tests and a wider variety of questions and assignments.
This is a great course for those who study not for not studying. Shows many good and practising methods for being better learner and improving yourself psychologically. Sometimes it is better be psychologically efficiented than educationally. I graded 4 from five only because of this is not mathematical course. Nevertheless I am appreciated team who made this course. Thank you, and good luck ;) :)
One of the best courses I have attended.  The content is amazing and adds a lot to every learner.  It actually gives the keys to master tough subjects.  There was only one problem which is some boredom. I felt while watching videos because it was clear that the trainers are reading rather than explaining and talking naturally.  I hope you can fix this in the future.  With much love,  than you.
Some useful knowledge and some interesting study techniques. The teachers were engaging and well spoken. They seemed to have passion for the subject which helped me stay interested. I found the speaking to be too slow, but that is just me, and I sped it up to 1.5x so it was fine. Some of the graphics in the lesson were sort of confusing, more than helpful. This was my first course on coursera.
This class has helped me reignite my learning career to be a lifelong one. Barbara is a perfect professor for this class because she can empathize with students who may shy away from techinical subjects like mathematics and science. However, through this class and her book I've gained new learning techniques and, most importantly, a new confidence to pursue a career in the technology field.
The course designed is best. The contents are also excellent.It will a great improvement if the more points will be added in pdf file instead of giving reference details. For every session there is session pdf which gives some bullet points to remember - we can improve that pdf. The techniques ( analogy , metaphor )and method can be more elaborated and information should be provided in pdf
Excellent tips, though I found most of the videos somewhat patronizing, to be honest. Still, this course include many tips you probably didn't know and recommendations from teachers and professionals on how they study and learn. Overall, quite good! It certainly will teach you a thing or two about everything you did wrong when learning something new or everything you should've been doing.
I really enjoyed this course and found it to be very helpful. A lot of the information was common sense, but the science behind the rationale was very interesting and useful in learning anything new. It will also be very helpful to me as I commit to learning and retaining new information. I know the steps and their value in creating a better working memory and long-term memory for myself.
Although I've studied in this area before, I still learned a lot in this short course. I particularly liked that alongside the academic concepts around neuroscience, there were plenty of actionable tips and 'brain hacks' that I can use in my everyday life as well as my studies. My only criticism is that the sound was a little variable in a few of the videos, including some being cut off.
This course is done so well, that it is itself easy to learn. I would recommend this course to any high school or university student.Unfortunately, most of the advice is not very useful for someone who spends 8 hours at work and has two children at home :-) This course does not have people that are juggling work & life & study in mind. But if you are a full-time student, do not hesitate!
The course was really good and it helped me to get some new learning techniques and ideas. At first when we had to do this course for school I was like: 'This isn't going to be any helpfull at all'. But then while I was learning how to learn, I discovered some great techniques and helpfull tips! So I recommend this course to anybody who wants to get better and more efficient at learning.
The course introduces some sound basics of how we learn and remember things, which enables us to adapt our strategies to be more effective and increase recall of topics we want to tackle. The way the course is held, because of the animations and simple examples, makes it look like it's adapted more to people of younger age, but I this when that's put aside, it's applicable for everyone.
A lot of useful and practical advices and information about learning. Definitely worth the time you'll put in it. Really enjoyed some of the tips applied in the video (powerful pictures used like zombie, mental palace etc) Some of the technical/bio video should use more of that model to explain the concept. Not sure I can quote properly any of the scientific concept that was explained.
i loved how to course was build and developed .i really enjoyed how any assumption here was scientifically based , and how everything was explained by diving into the structure of the brain.a little tip for improvement i wouldve add a wrriten summary of the tips and bottom lines for every week and also add a little bit more practical material as there were in week 4.thank you so much!
I am an Engineering student before doing this course, I used to believe that I am not made for mechanical. but while doing this course I understood my mind clearly, now I know whether to be interested in something or not is also a choice and not predetermined for your personality. I understood if I try to focus I can come over my problems with tough subjects. Now I know how to learn.
Content was well presented. The reading of the teleprompter was sometimes awkward and distracting, but ended up being an exercise in focus in itself. I feel like there could have been more description or examples of actually consciously creating a "chunk", as opposed to the more theoretical description of what it is and how it works... something to research, I suppose. Thanks much!
A scientific insight into different techniques for effective learning is offered in this course but I wish the way it had been delivered had incorporated scientific methods for effective teaching too.The contents of this course were excellent but its pace was very slow and hence boring at times.Reading the transcript was better than watching the video since the video was very slow.
This course help me to structure my knowledze about sevreal learning principles which i once heard or read about (e.g. overlearning, focused/difused modes,procrastination problems) plus I was first acquintated with some new learning techniques such as "pomodoro". Good "delivery" of material from lectors, and several really exciting additional videos. My overall score for course 4.5
This is a concise add content packed class that made me think about how I study and learn. It introduces a lot of great techniques as well as great explanations for those techniques. The way the class works employs the techniques they teach us such as interleaving and repetition. I feel much more confident about the range of material and skills I can learn now after this class :)
A great basic understanding of the neuroscience and psychology behind learning. Some great tips for improving study habits and test-taking. I haven't read/listened to the book yet, but it's on my list. Definitely recommend for anyone nervous about going to school or back to school, especially returning adult learners with no background in learning/studying or needing a refresher.
I enjoyed this course and now feel more confident to tackle subjects that I normally would avoid. The tips and strategies taught in this course will help me to learn more and have less anxiety taking tests. I always have had test anxiety and I think that now that I've learned how to learn I will do better on tests! Lots of content and a great course for anyone who likes to learn!
Thanks to everyone who participated in this course , i think this course was very helpful to me and i will benefit from it a lot in the future . also i have learnt a lot of information related with best techniques in learning and also information about brain which i love to know about it more. this course will help me to change my life so again thanks to the staff of this course.
It was a good course and helped me out of misconceptions i had about ways of learning and also helped to re-enforced  some of my own belief systems. I specially liked the section on procrastination and how to handle the same. I will definitely try to imbibe some of the learning in my professional life and as far as possible will try to disseminate the learnings with others.
Dr. Oakley was fantastic. However the other instructor was very bad. Every time his video came he was clunky in presenting and clearly reading off a teleprompter. When taking quizzes I was confused on questions related to his videos because they were so hard to follow and understand. He is clearly a very smart Doctor but I think should not be involved with this course.
Have many interesting aspects for teachers too understand, especially on how focus and defused mode of the brain works, and how to use it effectively in your lectures . only thing i think there is missing is a bit more theory about the serotonin, Dopamine and Acetylcholine. so it's not only  primal function mentioned , but also how it interaction with the brain itself.
i love it, every information was a joy and presented in an attractive and excitement way.thanks for the doctors effort to make learning this approachable. i only wished if there is more about the memory and more exercises and logic issues to solve. and maybe some experiences from students that were successful to boost their learning and got a better result afterwards.
I enjoyed the course, and I felt that it provided many valuable insights for a beginner in learning methods. While some of the course work seemed intuitive, I believe that Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski did a wonderful job of ensuring that there were no gaps in the fundamentals. This course definitely feels like it will positively impact me even years into the future.
Quiete an interesting course. There are helpful techniques that can be used. Barbara Oakley was speaking clearly and in e very fascinating way, meaning that it was really interesting, no other way to express it. Though it's still unfortunate that to get a certificate you have to pay. But thank you for the opportunity of getting to pass this course through for free.
I really had a great time learning this course and it really helped me in learning new things, i find it easy and i have tried my best to get rid of procrastination which is working, i'm thankful that i'm able to participate in this. Thank you Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski  and every other persons that help put this together, great appreciation to Coursera as well.
Very interesting course. Gives new perspetctives on learning. Provides many usefull techniques on learning. The cons of this course, for me, was the form of presentation (especially in terms of design- some graphics, animation effects, audio and video montage, overall layout was sometimes irritating), but the content of presentations covered all the minor defects.
For me this is great course. This opened my mind to how study better and more eficiente.Two topics called me attention "procrastination" and "how unlock your potential".
Other simple technique called "Pomodoro" help you study simple and better.
But the principal message from course is "Dedication and repetition". 

Thank you for teach me "Learning how to learn".
This is a really helpful course very intuitive and interesting interviews  I think Barbara has done splendid job kudos and lots of thanks  for the wonderful tips and tricks. These tips are not only handy but easy to learn and once master can really change your life. Once again thanks for putting all the hard work in bringing such a wonderful course in Coursera.
This is a very good course describing some very powerful tools for learners. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it is oriented towards classic students, and a huge chunk of the course is concentrated around how to take tests, and participate in study groups, rather than describing some more techniques on how to master whatever is being learned.
This course was tremendously helpful in providing powerful tools to fight procrastination, which is one of my biggest problems in learning. The course also provided interesting insight into the workings of the brain and how we learn. I now use what I learned in this course to realize when I am procrastinating, then employ the tools from the course to fight it.
A wonderful course that has taught me a lot about my brain, memory and various techniques that I can apply in real life to learn more efficiently and long term. I will take these lessons with me throughout my life and hopefully review them spatially to move them into my long term memory and have them readily available, when there is something to be learned.
This course helped me to learn new things. It helps me how to be an effective learner. This course is designed effectively. I think it will be beneficial for all background people. I feel pleased for learning especially the learning method, Pomodoro technique, the advantages of sleep, chunking. These topics are inevitable for becoming an effective learner.
This Course has taught me a lot about what learning at it's height looks like, and has also let me learn a lot more about the brain, and had backed up my growth mindset. Not too long of a course, and engaging too! the only problem I have is confusion, because some things they say aren't very clear to me, and some of my ideas become jumbled and scrambled.
This course really provides effective mental tools and methods for a better learning. Many of these methods seem to be effective for me and other methods would be effective in other specialties. The effectiveness of exercise in promoting the brain and the process of learning really impressed me and was probably the best thing I learned from this course.
Exceptionally good course to enhance one's soft-skills on learning; in a quick and effective manner validated through various scientifically proven techniques.The course helps in using the techniques of effective learning in academics as well in personal life.I found this course very impressive, motivating and interesting.Thanks a lot to the professors.
This the course everyone should take before taking any other course on coursera- of course, if you really want to learn! This is the course, every educator should take and try and incorporate these ideas at their institution. An amazingly crafted course and uses most of its techniques in this very course to make us learn how to learn more effectively.
The material in the course is very good and introduces a lot of good tips and processes. My only concern is that I may not internalize the ideas and make them habitual. As the course says, it is a process. So the course teaches techniques which is probably as much as it can do. Will I remember to implement them....well that's my  problem, I guess:)
This course provided me with right direction and attitude for all my future learning.Thank you!Although the material and the style of presentation was absolutely excellent, the 1 star off is only due to some technical glitches of the course presentations(mostly Coursera I guess)  - no sound or no image on videos, sound and video not synchronized.
why am not doing this ? I cannot get this i never well? when will i ever  be able to remember ? you get the whys and how it happen . you get to understand alot about learning about yourself and the most important procrastination the number one reason you do't do anything you want to do .Fun and informative and your life will never be the same :)
The kind of course that every school should have in their first semester whether if it's in the primary school, high school, or the university. Learning life would have been so much better with this course for the students. I recommend to study this kind of course every once in a while (I will review how I learn again in the next 3 or 5 years).
This course was brilliant on the whole! The videos and interviews were good, although it could have gone into more depth into how we use our brains to harness the concepts and our thinking to come up with solutions to unfamiliar situations. This has revolutionized the way I learn, and given me a fresh perspective into how the human brain works.
I found the course helpful.  As an older life long learner, I have had experience in identifying and modifying bad study habit.   This course reinforced what I have picked up along the years.  I applaud the clarity of the short segments of each lesson and  think that this course would be extremely helpful for those of us with poor study habits.
Real interesting course. in the end, a lots of useful tips to learn more effectively in every days life.and some insight of understanding why it is the best way!!nevertheless i woud have love some more details and help on creating for instance a memory palace which seems at the end of the course still enigmatic!very pleasant teachers!thank you
Considering my age (75) and state (alas retired) it's obvious that my 
motivation to take this course may be different from that of younger 
people in the course of their studies or career. Anyway I found the 
whole course stimulating and for sure a lot of concepts and tips are 
beneficial at all ages and situations. Thanks to the teachers !
I find the videos to be a little bit dry, and sometimes i end up accidentally focussing more on the visuals(images and little clips and things) than the content itself. But things are explained very well and the videos are in very manageable chunks. I find the information really helpful and i look forward to putting more of it into practice.
A very useful course, especially if you are returning to an academic environment and want to improve your approach to your studies. Not only can you learn techniques to be more effective as a learner, but increase your understanding of why these techniques works. There are also interesting optional materials, such as interviews,  available!
I really feel I have learnt a lot from this course and I look forward to implementing some of their techniques.  Dr Oakley was particularly good. I struggled with her somewhat soporific voice at the start of the course but once I realised how good the content was I managed to stay awake.  I found Dr Senjowski somewhat harder to learn from.
I thought the content in the course was great.  Barbara Oakley did a great job of presenting the material and was easy to follow and understand.  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski sounds like an expert in his field, but his presenting skills are lacking.  He was choppy in the videos and it was hard to listen to him on the few sessions he presented.
It's a really interesting course where I learned a lot about methods and tools of studying.  It's a lesson filled with wise knowledge and encouragement.  The instructors are really enthusiastic to create influences on the students.  Overall, I really encourage people to try on this course since there's a lot to gain and nothing to lose.
Many interesting techniques to better learning and memorizing the material you want. But, IMHO, the concept of chunking isn't discovered by 100%. Also, I think, that material can be arranged more effectively to understand easier. Anyway, I am very happy, that I learned how to learn and the information is really helpful to learn. Thanks!
I feel that Dr. Oakley put a lot of effort into making the course materials memorable. This instructor seems to have a natural ability to make concepts easy to follow and, more importantly, easy to recall after taking the class. Thanks to Dr. Oakley for a well prepared and interesting course that I will benefit from long after taking.
If you give some more practical exercises, i mean work sheet, it will be more helpful. But so far i have not read mind for numbers. so i hope some more information will be available in the book. Finally the major thing i came to know is , when we know more about our brain we can learn more and easily. thanks for teaching how to learn.
This was a great course with a lot of helpful techniques. I enjoyed doing the homework assignment, but I wish, along with the peer given grades, that we were graded by staff as well. It would be nice to not only get the opinions of those going through the course, but those who are well versed in the material providing their feedback.
This course is very helpful for people looking for a way to learn more efficiently. That being said, I feel  that many students might not grasp that fact because they feel that they know already much of what is said. I honestly don't know how you could improve that without putting some thought into it. I hope this helpsand thank you.
This course really provides great insights into how to train your brain to achieve the desired results. This is immensely helpful when you are learning a new skill, new language or attempting a hard topic. The course also provides techniques for committing things to your permanent memory and useful ways to deal with procrastination.
Some of the course materials are useful to high-school students, not to people in life-time education (like, procrastination or test-taking stress). However, all other subjects was very useful, especially I would like thank the course team and personally  Barbara for very interesting optional interviews with interesting people :)
This was my first online course that I actually completed. I enjoyed the ease of access and the genuine candor of the instructors. I could come back to the lessons at any time, but learned to learn in specific focused lengths of time with specific goals. I will utilize this knowledge moving forward in my career and personal life.
Very instructive course, in a totally pleasant way. It is not a strict one to follow, has a lot of interesting material in various aspects and different views of the issue. And totally pleasant instructor to watch :) It made me think about a lot, both regarding learning as a procedure, as well as about me as a learner. Thank you!
Brilliant course..! I am utilizing many methods of learning taught as a part of this course in my professional life. It is a very engaging course, very well conceptualized and presented.  I think it should be one of the starting courses for people joining coursera for the very first time. 
Best wishes for future.

Big Thanks..!
this course was great and very helpful for studying,  this course gave me tips, ways, and strategies for the real way of how to study! although the course was too long, it's really helpful and I think those who made this course were knowing the student's problems and they actually live it!thank you for everyone for this course
I have gained a good understanding of learning techniques. The course also walks the talk as it involves testing and recall. Repeating past lessons keeps the material in your working memory as you move along and by the time you are done, you would still be able to recall the first lesson you took because of spaced repetition.
Thank you so much for making this course, It really helpful to learn and also easy to follow so I think the early you learn this the better you are when you have to learn something new and especially is you are a student :) Hope you enjoy the course like I do :) Thank our teacher so much again for making learning how to learn
The content of this course was great. The videos were a little odd at first (could be a cultural thing) and a portion of the content was obviosly scripted and felt a little more robotic but I got used to that pretty quickly. The information aligned with previous study but also brought a lot of new techniques and information.
I took this course because I had not been in the world of academia for a while. I found it helpful because it reminded me of things I knew as well as giving me new approaches to learning. The greatest lesson was not to beat yourself up and take the time to learn. Perseverance is the key anything can be accomplished with it.
Good course. The videos could be made more interactive and engaging by having options before diving further into a topic. Also, the tests after each week - no need to restate, "as mentioned in the videos" in every other questions - surely it is implied. Overall, interesting concepts, some of which I have researched further.
In general, the whole course is super easy to understand even when professors are talking about some scientific explanations. However, i would say, this course might need to be updated to current realities as it seems that the course is made around 10 years ago. But still most of the content is relevant nowadays. Thank you!
So I really loved the course, but I felt the assignments/tests were a bit too easy. They seemed to focus on memorization more than application, which I am not sure is the goal if course aims to teach learning. However, I do not mean to criticize it too much, as this may just come from my previous experience in neuroscience.
I would recommend everyone of my friends to take this course - irrespective of whether or not they want to learn a specific academic subject. It would be nice if school courses first teach this course as part of curriculum - which surely helps students to to know how to approach the different topics that they want to learn.
While I did love all the ideas for learning techniques, I don't believe any of them are new or break-through ideas. I have seen the same concepts talked about before in various places on the internet. Although I am impressed by the amount of expert advice and piled into one location and for that I will give it four stars.
My regards to both Dr. Barbara Oakley and and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, 

  for this wonderful course. A whole new world of ideas has opened to me and I have greatly improved my capacity as a learner. These few weeks were full of discovery and satisfying work. I will put my new knowledge into a good use pursuing my career.
I think that diffuse the knowledges for free is a beautiful thing but i think also that i can learn quickly if i can learn also in my mother language because my englesh is not so good. I understand that also this is a way to speak a better english for me, but is possible that other students know already english language.
A very well-don course giving so many suggestions about learning methods.The professors are clear and able to illustrate very difficult concepts in an easy way.I suggest this course to everyone willing to empower his learning capabilities.I'm MA Sidoni and I thanks all this course contributors for teaching how to learn!
This course should be taught at every primary school as a mandatory course. After completing the course i wished to come across this a decade before which could have enabled me to learn and think in a different way than what i am now thinking..!!thanks to Barbara okley madam and team for teaching this wonderful subject.
I enjoyed the course. It has helped me think about how I approach learning.Although I have many qualifications, I've never really thought about learning. Its something I just do. I've got to the point where I need to be more efficient at it. This course has certainly given me some tools and approaches to take forward.
This course is short but might be interesting to many people because it gathers ideas about learning from many sources. Some of those ideas you might have heard of before, some ideas you might as well be already using intuitively, but stating them explicitly in a course gives them more validity to persevere in them.
I enjoyed this course.  I wish it went more deeply into the physiological aspects of learning (neural structure/chemistry); but it was still a useful tool for forming good study habits and building an abstract understanding of brain function.  I wish I were exposed to this kind of information much earlier in life!
It's an interesting way to learn about the right and wrong things we have been doing while learning different things. Many useful concepts were taught and They have been useful in helping me learn. However, some of the concepts could have been named in a more concise way. Like "Hard start Jump to easy" for example
The course can be useful when you're in school, or just beginning with university. I've already applied most of the techniques before knowing them through this course so it wasn't as useful as I had hoped, but I can clearly see how it can be useful to others. 4/5 for imaginative presentation and practical advice.
I like all the information conveyed by this course. Thanks for all of it, it will surely make my future better. I think the course's presentation could have been better, there were so many analogies that it's easy to forget the main idea behind them and just remember the pictures if students are not more careful.
Very interesting & useful.I would have given 5/5 if it was a little less ...easy. *But in second thought, if it was more complex, it wouldn't be so attractive and helpful to many "students" who face difficulties in learning.I see it as an introduction to begin learning (again).Thank you!  It is a 4.5/5 for me :)
Really good course! My first with Coursera, and I'm glad I started here.It does seem to be more aimed at high school or college age people though, which was not clear to me at the start. For that reason, I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. If you are a student in that age bracket, I strongly recommend this course.
Great build on topics that are usually not accessible with pure logic, but as taught can make a lot of sense, and also the accompanying articles and interviews add a lot to the picture.Would have been good if the summary videos had an accompanying text bullet points of the covered material for future reference.
I'm very happy to complete this course. Thanks for teaching a great technique to help me learn better and improve my English skill. This is the first English course I have learned and completed. It is the motivation for me to learn another course in Coursera. Thank you very much for all the great information!!
Solid and helpful information in this course! My only critique would be the inconsistent volume levels during the videos (some are quiet, some are louder). Although, it is well thought out. Dr. Oakley's book, A Mind for Numbers has been on my reading list for a while now. Can't wait to dig in to it! Thanks!
Loved this course, I learnt a lot how my thought process and memory works and I am now more organized and relaxed when faced with a problem I'm bumping into : I just do something else, knowing my brain is still working out in the background and will eventually come back with something ;-)Thank you Barb !
Through these course, I learnt lot of effective learning strategies and by means of optional learning got exposed to renowned personalities and their experiences. Also, it is interesting how Coursera platform uses ideas like recall and mini-tests for effective learning which are taught in this course.
It was a great course in turns of developing a better understanding of how to learn. That seems broad but that's the best way to sum it up. The class gives you tactics, and ways to manage how you learn properly. I was able to implement many of the tactics and methods I learned in the class right away.
Oh too much people will enter this course thinking that they will give you a magic formula.. and that's not the case these techniques you'll learn will help you but it's up to you to try them, there's no magic if that's what you're looking for. Besides that, I just find the audio quality a little bad.
Would recommend it to everyone. It is not a long course and the information I got from this course is quite valuable even if I am out of school and I do not have to pass exams, in particular. The course is very useful in understanding how our brain works as far as learning is concerned in particular.
Although this course seems to be focused mainly on students, I found many of the concepts taught very relevant to me (as a working professional) as well. The theory is explained with humor and insight - Barbara is a pleasure to listen to and watch. She obviously enjoys teaching this course very much.
Nice cues and scientific studies allows you to enjoy the course neatly and gladly. Above all, have the opportunity to learn from aware teachers, is not a thing you can see everyday. Teachers' words make you want to put into practice all the advices as soon as possible. I had a great journey, thanks.
This was the best online course that I have done so far. It's verry interesting and logical to learn. Only one thing was not so good; When the test Q&A are also in German, then I can give five stars. When English are not the first language it's verry difucult to understand the questions and answers.
I really got me hooked to this course and completed it one week before the schedule. The course has been designed meticulously to help learners get the concepts with ease. Its very precise, simple and effective. Incorporates all the elements of quality learning in the course itself..That was amazing
I really enjoyed doing this course I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to follow. I couldn't complete the final optional assignment (because of technical issues) which was disappointing. I just want to keep on studying but am having a bit of difficulty fining a free course to follow up with.
I learned some very helpful and practical tips and tricks during this course to improve my studying (at university). Moreover, the tips and tricks given here are supported by scientific (neurological) research. Learning how these tips and tricks work and whý they work made me want to try them out.
we often learn things daily ,but little we know about how to learn effectively, I liked the instructors barbara oakley and terrence senjowski's comforting voice tone and this course helps to learn things better. This is a fun filled and fact filled course that anyone with ability to learn can do.
Contains some nice habits that can be integrated easily in the daily learning experience.Overall not too scientific.The part on memorizing techniques could have been made better. Good explanations and techniques on how to memorize abstract things like numbers and names have not been covered well.
This course was great. Lots of extra information for added learning, lots of review on all the concepts helps make them easier to remember. The only thing I didn't like is that many of the questions on the quizzes were repeated several times, and almost everyone question was had multiple answers.
Overall great course, lots of tips and tricks to get better at learning stuff.Despite this, there are some pitfalls to this course:Volume of some lectures is too low.Male lecturer reads all his lectures, seems stiff, unnatural.Sometimes language is to "academic" for regular people to understand.
Great course. but they sometimes fall into the trap of testing you on concepts not perviously discussed or not discussed in detail.However, those incidences were few so  it made the course pasable. Neverthel   ess,  this course opened my eyes to new ways of learning that will help me in future.
The first 3 weeks are very good , they focus on the learning process as expected . The last week is useless about learning , a bunch of test tips . It´s unnecessary , it should be kay as optional lessons , but as mandatory it´s really waste of time if you are just looking for the leaning tools.
5 stars if the audio from the videos would remain at a consistent level and also would be amplified a bit more as i often have it maxed out and still have trouble hearing much of the vid content. The content itself is priceless imo. Really excellent tools that you'll use the rest of your life.
It was really outstanding coarse. I think that it is more important to learn how to learn.When we go through it we find more easier to develop interests in learning anything through the tricks that professor teaches in this course.Lastly thank y so much barba oakley for such wonderful coarse
Its a good course and will be become more beneficial if it involves atleast 2-3 situations for practice. As in many Videos, Oakly madam used to says that Practice makes perfect.Overall, I am satisfied with this course and hope to apply these techniques and tools which I earned from Coursera.
This course is very helpful, I learned a lot of information that will change my academic career for the better. The only reason this is not 5 stars is that the production value and audio quality can be shaky at times. But other than that I really recommend this course to anyone and everyone.
A fantastic introduction to various techniques and effective strategies concerning learning. Clear, easy to understand and just all around pleasant experience. Recommended to everyone who wishes to start their journey of effective learning, or just wants to fill in holes in their knowledge.
This is a thought provoking course giving a number of extremely useful insights on how to learn more effectively and become a better learner. I wish it had been longer, more extended and probably a bit more complex. Anyway, the knowledge given in the course has already proved to be helpful!
Currently I'm MD graduated and pass my first board the last year and now I'm studying to complete all my boards, and this course actually is helping me to be a better learner now comparated with before, the techniques and advices related how to learn more efficiently and deep are excellent.
You'll probably think you already know all that is needed to learn things,but this course gave 4-5 excellent methods to me at least.The Professors teaches in a calm and explanatory manner and much easy to comprehend.It's not even that long and you get a lot of output in such as short time.
Not overly aesthetic but important info.  Sent link to our Upper Arlington School District's leadership suggesting making the course available to students, parents and faculty might be very impactful.  Seems wise to learn early how to learn!  Thank you for your important work and insights.
I really learned some important tips on learning to share with my high school students. I still am cloudy on some areas of terms in this course but it was my fault for not entering in discussions. It was the Christmas season and I really didn't have the time to do so. I did enjoy this one.
Great techniques and ideas for everyone to use throughout your life! Whether you are a stress test taker, or have a firm grasp of learning this class is for you to help understand "How the brain learns". Dr Oakley is a great inspiration for those who think they can't learn math..Thank you!
Excellent course... very useful and relevant to people who are working in different fields but have to keep studying to keep up with the advances. I'll highly recommend this course for anyone struggling how to make better use of their time and how to get better results of study sessions.
I am Dr. Sanjay Kumar very happy to expresses my word  after complete this course Learning How to learn that is designed by Barbara Oakley and  Terrence Sejnowski. Both have good understanding about the course. Great Course, really its an intellectual interaction with the  great Couple.
At tImes slow and dIffIcult to force myself to stay with It - at other tImes fascinating and insightful. In the end, very useful, and informative. There many areas with seamless overlaps outside of learning and the learning process where this information will help in life. Recommended!
I'm a lifelong learner who never realized my true potential during my formal education. I wish I'd had a course like this available back then to teach me how to learn. The instructors offer truly valuable advice on how to effectively learn that anyone will find useful in their studies.
Very informative course. I'd recommend anyone to take it. I did feel like the later modules were not as interesting as the earlier ones but that's just my opinion. Some might find them really helpful. Regardless this course has changed how I learn now and in the future. Thanks guys!
Highly Recommended course as it explains the science behind the art of learning and also provides us with many techniques that will be beneficial for our process of learning. I really enjoyed the course as both instructors put up a lot of hard work for making this course enjoyable.
I am not a native english speaker so please excuse the following.Every student should, at some early point of his cursus, learn this.It could avoid you some very frustrating failures along the way.At the very least, it will help you understand the setbacks as you come to face them.
The information in this course was very good and the instructors were passionate about the topic.  The video quality looks very dated and takes away from the production value of the course.  It would be great if they could update the look of the videos and keep the content intact.
This class had a great array of study tips for learning how to learn. The instructors were very engaging and explained concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. They combined useful strategies with background knowledge on modern neuroscience, which made the course very enriching.
This outstanding course is a good introduction on the learning of concepts that are needed to learn math and science.  These do not come easily to me, so I very thankful that the instructors took time out of their lives to teach an adult student about how to learn these subjects.
All information was presented with a scientific backup and from multiple points of view.This is a fundamental course to anyone that wants to have a continuous learning process. The curricula and extra documentation its design to facilitate  a long term acquisition of information.
Some really great tips on how to learn effectively. Scientifically accurate and pitched at an appropriate level. That said, at times, it wasn't clear how to actually use the information in the course to improve one's learning. More practical examples would have helped with this.
This Course was a great refresher for me, as I just started to learn after a long time. Its great effort by Barbara and I appreciate the the passion she has in teaching I come across a very few teacher who put efforts like this.Thanks Coursera,Barbara and SkenoseskiRegardsDinesh
It was  good course .Learning how to learn mainly focused ,how to approach the tough subjects in a comfortable way.There are many methods like Pomodoro, Chunking ,Exercise,making rewards,focus on the process,etc.I've enjoyed the learning how to learn in a easy way.Thank you....
Got to know about many new techniques about how to learn. Started using Pomodora technique. I still need a good amount of fight against procrastination and feeling down when studies do not go as planned. The final assignment on week 3 was a bit confusing. I could not do that.
Excellent Course , Great Faculty and Amazing tips for learning .Its for every person whose aim is to learn what ever might be his age or the subject he wants to learn.One of the Essential life skill Learning how to learn.Thanks to every person who made this MOOC Possible. :)
This course really help me a lot in many ways. I just hope they teach more lively and change some of the vids to look more modern. This course gave me a principle that anything can be learned which made me learn new wonderful things. I couldn't believe I will love learning.
Good Course on better ways to learn & Remember. Some of the Interviews were really good with learning from the ones who have mastered the technique.  Only Suggestion is that the Pace can be a bit faster. Thanks to the Masters who have done the presentation. Really Useful.
Decent course ... focus more on school-based activities and taught with that in mind.  However, about 80% may be applied to new skills (i.e. swimming, dancing, piano playing).  Not what I expected but teachers are good, and one of them (Terry) is well-respected in ML/AI.
Good course that gives cursory knowledge of some study tools. It's not a breakthrough, must-complete course by any means, and the material it handles isn't overly complex (given the abstracts it uses), but it does quite well and provides meaningful insights for students.
Very interesting! How the mind works, and why schools don´t teach this from early age!? The important aspect of learning, is to know how to learn! It would help so many frustrated people! They think they are stupid, when reality they just might have bad studying skills!
Overall very good material. It sometimes became a bit too childish for my liking with octopusses & zombies running around the screen, but otherwise nice and concise ideas and good structure. Could also have been nice with a bit more depth in the scientific explanations.
A goldmine of actionables backed by science. If you want to get better at whatever in life you must take this course.I didn't give it 5 starts because I believe there could be better questions in tests and a general polish up of the classes. But I'm nitpicking, really.
Interesting content presented in an engaging manner. Though this course is for a general audience, it would have been nice to cover more technical details or for the course to have been a bit more challenging. Overall, this a great introduction to the topics presented.
The "Learning How To Learn" is a best course for people who can kick-off your carrier or improve your learning skills. A lot of material helped me to understand what I'm doing wrong, but at the same time not a lot of new things were covered for me. So, 4/5 - my point.
I took up this course anticipating that i would pick up tips and tricks to be a better learner, because we are all lifelong learners. I was not disappointed. Not only did i  learn how to learn but also learnt how i could  implement certain principles in my own class.
I enjoyed hearing the ideas presented by Professors Barbara & Terry about learning and brain function.  I believe that my self-confidence in my ability to learn is now beginning to return, and I hope to proceed into roles in life that will be of service to humanity.
I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS 10.15 YEARS AGO BUT ITS NEVER TO LATE .VERY EFFECTIVE TIPS ONCE YOU START TO IMPELEMENT THESE TECHNIQUES YOU WILL  SURELY EXPERIENCE YOUR VIEW/PERCPECTIVE  ON ATTEMPTING PROBLEMS,TEST ETC HAS CHANGE FOR BETTER.THANK YOU DR BARBARA OA
This course was short and sweet, and I think has significantly helped my learning habits. My only quibble is that it sometimes seemed like Dr. Sejnowski was reading from a script, and it would have a more natural feel were he to discuss the subject more casually.
Excellent course for undergraduate students who want to improve their learning skills and don't know where to start. It gives some very useful tips for learning effectively which can be used by anyone who wants to learn new things but is finding difficulty in it.
This course has complex concepts explained  in a simple manner. What you can also see is a walk the talk attitude, because the techniques the professors teach us are seen very clearly in they way they organized the videos, the tests and the sequence of contents.
This is my first online course at Coursera.org I really appreciated it,I definitely recommend this course to anyone it is well organized, the teachers(Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski are highly skilled), the content, the videos, interviews are very engaging.
Yes, this course helped me to learn many new things about brain, memory, thinking habits,procrastination and many more.I loved this course as it is very professional. This course gives great amount of materials to learn more about topics covered in the course.
Lots of great advice and instruction. Understanding how your brain works has helped me improve my study habits, and _enjoy_ the act of studying. My only feedback would be for more exercises on building out a memory palace. Definitely an area I hope to pursue.
Great course. I learned quite a lot about how learning works and some basic neuroscience related to learning as well. There are several useful learning tips and methods taught here. I recommend this course to everyone who is looking to improve their learning.
It is a very good course that helps you to understand the philosphy of learning.I only give 4 out of 5 stars because what I was missing was more practical information about how to study. (Only few methods were introduced to help improve the study experience).
This course is good in providing students tips for effective learning. Students are better in how to learn, however, it could be better if more cases, especially students with learning difficulties, are provided to illustrate how learning tips solve problems.
I have really enjoyed this course in which I  have learnt many ways of learning such as Pomodoro technique which I like the most . I have started implementing it and it is awesome . I only gave 4 stars since the scientific language is more than can be used .
The course was highly informative on psychological and scientific grounds which really helped in understanding the concepts as an authenticated study material.Few more regarding the facts of sleep and how brain works while sleeping will definitely add value.
Great course! the honors project I wrote and handed in on time for week 1 didnt get graded, I graded 5 peers and fulfilled that requirement, however I only was graded by 1 other student....... so I didnt bother finishing the honors track, which is a bummer.
As with many subjects, it is what you think you know that prevents one from making progress; both from a perspective of the lack of a perceived need for continued work as well as new and counter-intuitive concepts that are the essence of new understandings.
Learning How to Learn:Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects was really an interesting course but the second last retrieval practice was not up to my mark as I think due to some technical issues it got stuck in 2 only though I had scored 4.
The course is amazing, It gave me a believe that I can learn whatever I want to despite what people may say about inverse relation between age and learning capability. I am folloing some of the guidelines and find them very helpful in learning new subjects.
I enjoy learning this course. Throughout the course, I have learn so many things regarding brain technique that I can use for learning any new thing regardless of area of subject. Also it helps me deal with the problems that I had during previous learning.
This was a very interesting class. The principles covered were helpful and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning how to learn. As I went through it my recurring thought was "Why didn't they teach me these concepts in middle school?"
I LOVE this course, I am certain I will study my class notes and change my way of thinking, learn to chunk better and I am sharing my knowledge with my husband, my children, family and friends. I feel a confident taking on new challenges in my career path.
this course gives in a fun and easy way practical tools for studying more effectively, share with us successful experience of others, and general knowledge of our brain.with only little effort you can become a better student, and a better mentor to others.
It's apparently not true that "you can't teach an old dog new tricks!" I learned a lot in this course, I just wish I could have taken it when I was 40 years younger. Well worth the time invested, and I hope to use some of the techniques in the near future.
it´s been a great experience , this kind of course should be mandatory for every elementary school and college before any lecture is given. Otherwise people are going to waste time and money on education if they don´t know how to learn in the first place.
Nice introductory course to learning, which fills an important gap in education. I would have personally liked a little more rigour to the assignments and material, but the current level is, I suppose, targeted to participants of all kinds, which is fair.
Very interesting, really helps set all the ideas and things I knew in my head and just organized it and motivates me to get the important things done.Ironically enough I was procrastinating starting this course and as soon as I did it pushed me to go on
I found this cours good but not perfect. Many things were more or less intuitive in my opinion. But nevertheless worth watching. I even read the book, but I would suggest to do either this course or to read the book. Doing both is definitely redundant.
It was a great course.It will really help me to learn the things that are important to me in a well planned way.A great guide to make learning effective.The interviews are really great and insightful.Really happy that i decided to opt for this course.
An amazing course to help debunk a lot of myth, provide you with a lot of simple and effective study tips.The videos, the instructors both are very amazing. I am happy I took this course and I hope it will benefit me in my future learning experiences.
It's amazing course . I really enjoying it right now cause it has a lot of information and help me to realise what is the problem and it gives me tools to solve my problem and the common problem it that way .. so Thanks for learn how to learn team :D
I thank creators of this course for their great efforts in creating this course.  Many useful study techniques explained, however, many of the examples, analogies did  not work for my brain and made me confused. Still I highly recommend this course,
I rated it with four stars not for something wrong about instructors (sure not) but because of the boor of my English, some expressions where very difficult and the translation was not helpful, but in general I loved this course so much.Thank you :)
Very helpful! Assisted me in grasping how to more easily retain memory and transfer it from your working to long term memory. It also provided some assistance in general learning and life skills. Would have liked more. Highly recommend doing honors.
The lectures made me reevaluate what I considered "studying" and explained how I can trick my brain in to being more efficient at taking in information. The last week contains some good test taking advice and motivation. Highly recommend this class!
Very interesting course, with lots of very good tips and useful advice on how to improve learning, and also how to understand what is happening when learning a new thing. Its tips on procrastination are certain to help you make the most of your day.
An easy to follow along educational course about different techniques to help open your mind to learning. Each week is full of great information broken down into fun and short chunks that make the course flow and increases the desire to learn more.
I found this course interesting. It could be made better by including practical exercises to apply previously learned techniques rather than simply the multiple choice questions about the information itself. I would recommend this to all learners.
Some of the materials are missing, for example the test check list from R Felder, and the videos are kinda old, Mr. Seynowski is always reading the text in a awkward way, but the stuff he's saying is interesting nonetheless. Thanks for this class.
I learned the skills in this course:
1. List the tasks so as not to be missed;
2. Sleep and breathing are important for concentration;
3. Create rewards to encourage goals;
4. Create a habit to shape a personality;
5. Benefits of group study;
...
4/5 finished it in under 1 week but it could be faster, maybe have an alternative where you dont repeat yourself that much ? The resources, Optional Further Readings and Optional Interviews ARE A MUST !Dont forget to put it on 1.5x speed ;) ;) ;)
I really liked all the new techniques showed in this course. However, I enjoyed Barbara Oakley teaching but the videos look outdated and boring.Even though, thank you for doing this course. I believe I will have a better approach on my learning.
This course gives insight to how our brain functions and how we can use it to learn new things. Some of the tips taught, such as, the pomodoro technique, focused-diffuse thinking are really good. This course will also motivate you to learn more.
Insightful, entertaining, and relevant.  I found this course to be all of these things.  It gives me food for thought and will be very useful for any future courses I undertake.  The relaxation methods and the study advice will prove invaluable.
really enjoyed this course and the no-frills but effective presentation of the material.  The information is useful for not only students ( high school or college) but also employees who need to learn on the job and also those who are teachers.
This course is great. All the information they gave will be very useful in my life.
Even so I feel that the course has a very old edition in the videos, I think they could improve a lot if they could update the videos with a more recent style.
Lot of theory on working on brain is not required. Could have been supported by other techniques to help learning like pomodoro, metaphorical association etc. Delivery too slow and a little monotonous making student to zone out during lecture.
I really enjoyed this course.   The presentation style was very clear and it used techniques that were being taught to help learn the material.   I'm applying a number of the techniques in technical material I'm studying for my job and career.
This is a wonderful course to take because it has helped me improve the way in which I learn, how & when i learn. I'm less stressed when I'm learning and looking forward to using these techniques during my final exams for my Bachelors degree.
The course is great and awesome for people that are trying to get back to study or for students that are already engaged in school and need better techniques to learn. I would and in fact, I did recommend this course for a friend or familiar.
I really enjoyed this course.  Barbara Oakley was brilliant and explains things very clearly.  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, however, was incredibly difficult to listen to.  His speech didn't flow and that made it hard to follow what he was saying.
I will recommend the Coursera students to start with this course in order to make the most of other future courses. My only complain will be that it relays too heavily on videos, and having a reinforcement in text would help students like me.
It was a wonderful learning of "Learning how to learn" :-). There were few things which I was aware of and many small yet new things/techniques that I have learned in the course. Thanks to both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!!
A very good course. I enjoyed listening to some of the key ideas such as concentrating on process Vs product and focused Vs Diffuse modes.Thanks a ton for getting this on Coursera!Great Job by the team at University of California, San Diego.
Great course if you are having trouble/ or when you are faced with subjects that you do not understand and difficult to comprehend with. Contains important tools and skills that you can use to overcome your fears when starting a new thing.
It was a great learning experience.After this course, you'll approach your learning with a different state of mind, you'll hopefully be able to master the mental skills you have, and definitely shape your personal tailored way of learning.
This topic is kind of new for my so i am assessing this course as an almost beginner. A well structured course with a lot of usefull content. I would work a little bit on the visual display of the content but other than that great. Thanks
I felt the first week slow and was about to desist this course; fortunately for me I do not like to give up, logged in for week two and found it to be very interesting, helpful and of great value. These are, indeed, Powerful Mental Tools!
They are good videos. Some of them were new concepts or ideas to me and I can use them in my learning process. The whole video seemed to be made for teenage learners, but methods like Pomodoro can be used in many tasks not only learning.
Helpful course. I learned quite a bit. However, I think the key concepts here could've been explained in a more concise way for people like me who already have some knowledge regarding the topic. The name I found to be a bit misleading.
Many handy tools to add to your mental library, and solid intake of neurological knowledge as well. 4/5 because I hoped that even broader spectrum of techniques would be shown, and pacing of the course was personally a little too slow.
The techniques mentioned in the course can be very handy but need to be practiced. Some of the articles in additional reading are quite interesting and have good perspectives. Strongly suggest you go through them if you have the time.
The content in the course was great. Videos here and there feel a bit out dated but besides that cosmetic defect everything I learned, I will take on with me. I am really glad I learned about this course on Science of Success podcast.
It was worth my while. The advice offered is valuable, and I would even say insightful. I specifically enjoyed the interviews with some ace learners and their techniques. The guidance provided is useful for learners at almost any age.
Very useful for students - lots of tips on preparing for exams and so on. A little less useful for lifelong learners like myself, but contained a few good tips and information about how the brain works, and how to use it effectively.
A really enjoyable and interesting course. It is also very doable because the videos aren't really long and the script underneath them makes it easy to follow. Big thumbs up to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for presenting the course!
I am not a student but a learner.  I found this course to be a great introduction to the art and science of learning.  It would be great if Prof. Barbara would also define a course targeted at adults.  Thanks for a great experience.
A very insightful course! I have now a deeper understanding to better the way I can learn new things more efficiently. Here are the soft skills and resources that will benefit me for a lifetime! Thank you for creating this course:)
Great and very simple course. Lots of great tips to make a greater use of our brains. Some of the videos could be a bit shorter and a bit more straight to the point for a more enjoyable experience, but a very useful course to take.
Very good with a simple approach. I recommend it to all kind of people and not only for those who need to take tests. It's a good mixing of new approaches about learning and some old techniques - some I already did use in the past.
The course is packed with information and tips. It holds its promise to broaden our perspective on learning. Also the course is taught with passion and conviction by the teachers, making it even more enjoyable. Thank you very much.
I was encouraged to complete this course at the school where I am currently studying computer programming. I found the course interesting, I have learnt lots of new information and a couple of useful learning methods and "tricks".
It is a nice introduction, with important key points and good references for further reading. On a down side, it is kind of repetitive and in spite of the obvious enthusiasm of the speaker, sometimes the lectures are a bit boring.
Really a great course. I have learned a lot during this course. It was well explained, the teachers were dynamic and interesting. I believe everyone should take the 2 weeks this course requires in order to become a better learner.
It was hard on the first day and almost give up somehow but made it to week 4 during Work From Home period. Good to know about learning scientifically and logically. Hope i could implement those technique to next coursera course!
Good content, but I felt the tests were often throwing in unnecessarily bizarre options, that are obviously not true, as a means of testing. I felt this didn't reinforce what was taught as tests became an exercise is elimination.
This Course was useful for me , gave me a clue how to memorize better , how to study better .. but it was quite longer than what I thought and some parts were boring. This course could be shorter and more practical. Appreciate it
An interesting course, and not too intense! Great for allowing reflection on how to apply learning techniques more effectively, and introduces a couple of really useful processes and techniques that can be applied whilst learning
I really like the information provided in the course and it will be very helpful. the only thing that I will change is the audio on the videos should be standardized because the two speakers have a very different volume of voice.
Learning how to learn course shows a great step to learn a  new topic .here also explain how to human memory work and how to human should memorize a new thing.thanks, to all course co-ordinator and who create this course content
Great course, although the sound quality and use of greenscreens can sometimes be a bit distracting, especially in some of the early videos. Thank you very much for making this course and putting all of that personality into it!
I learnt a lot of methods to learn a new subject and become more proficient in it. There were good techniques to retain things in your long term memory.  There were very good tips for test taking also. Overall, a great course.
Very well done presented and explained by a very good professionals, showing up a very good and important tools that we got and we can use to potencially be better on all areas of our life.Thanks a lot by share with all of us.
I did learn some things I did not know before about methods to more effective learning, however the course was very repetitive. The video could have been summed up in an hour and a half lecture with the main ideas ironed out.
Very helpful and interesting. I would like some more techniques like the Pomodoro to be presented during the course. It would also be very helpfull to have the most important topics written in a list after every video-course.
This was a very instructive course, videos are very clear. I think that one thing that can be improved is practice, I would love to have more practice to get better all the concepts (altough I know that it is very difficult).
This course helped me to better understand we are in the age of re-learning. Particularly that is needed thanks to the access too the collective knowledge and history we now have thanks to digital technology and the internet,
An amazing course integrating all the relevant  concepts of psychology and letting viewers understand from the scratch.  Moreover, adding interviews and discussions with veterans to the course have made it exceptionally good.
I really enjoyed the course and its dynamic. It is fun and full of new perspectives of how to learn that you can apply for different areas. also really like the mini tests in between, which really helps the learning process.
This is the best course for you if you want to learn professional techniques, concepts, approaches and habits that will make learning things (whatever the domain is) more enjoyable and easy. Thank you for this great MOOC !!!
It definitely gave me insight on what works best when it comes to learning. I use a lot of the information now and I realize that I spend much less time studying while at the same time learning more than I would have before.
I enjoyed learning different techniques about how to expand and allow ourselves to learn new things. I also appreciate the explanation on how to use pomodoro technique to maximize time and energy in order achieve our goals.
This course help me understanding the basic way to learn and enhance your ability to learn especially suitable with your way of learning and makes you know if your way of learning until now is suitable for you or not. Nice.
It did provide some valuable insight that could be beneficial in studying. Though it did appear like to course was meant for full time students, I believe same steps can be applied in any other activity you are engaged in.
A good course. Even better if you have read the book b Barbar a Oackley before. It will enchance  your abilities. Because as it was said  one of the best learning techniques is testing. And there are plenty of those here.
Nice hints and nice topics. I've found the interviews very helpful.I did not like the video quality however, if you think to record the course again, please avoid too many movements or animations like in/out camera focus.
Very useful information.  I would have liked a bit more scientific information about how learning takes place, but this class did a good job of teaching me some ways to learn more effectively and to avoid procrastination.
One of the more invaluable courses available online, and its free. Information, tips and tricks contained in this course will definitely help seekers of learning effectively absorb new knowledge they're trying to acquire.
A fun short course that can help those struggling with studing or memory. Nothing to shocking in terms of advice but a definite must for someone who finds they merely read books and highlight and can't retain information
it was a great experience for me , thanks team learning how to learn for wonderful sessions and team coursera for creating this great platform for me and many across the world .than you once againstay home, stay safe!
Great course! I found this course after reading A Mind for Numbers by Dr.Oakley and having the visual course really helped me understand the concepts in the book. The videos in the course are a powerful teaching tool.
There were some useful tips in this course on how to learn or how to tackle a list of tasks. I felt the material was a bit dry and wished there were some more practical examples. Overall I thought it was pretty good.
This is  great course to understand human mind/brain and how it behaves while we learn something.This course has lots and lots of mind tricks and tips that can really help people learn new skills at any age and time.
Some vocabulary is difficult to understand for non-natif eglish.Subtitles in arabic and french use diffirent word for same terms in videos.The idea is clear, the quiz are very helpful to test understanding.Thank you.
Not bad overall. Some very useful tools, although I confess I found a lot of the delivery to be very dry...sorry! Best of all is the ongoing weekly email which continues to throw up new sources of info. Many thanks.
Just Great! Only bad point; to too extensive, examples and concepts were briefly described and left out areas which I thought was interesting. But on the whole, just great - I recommend everyone to take this course!
A great experience. Really helped me understand that age is not an issue just give in to your passion nd interests. Also how subjects like maths nd science could become easy and interesting but the techniques taught
Very interesting course with some practical tips on how to improve your learning process better. I wish I had done this code when I was in school or when I slogged during my grad school, but better late than never!
Thanks for this. I think that a lot of people will find useful information in this courses. Still it's coming with a lot of background and research information from viable source to bring us some very basic points.
the negative point in this course that it has a lot of hard expressions to understand easily especially for non native speakers even with the subtitle i face kind of hardness to understand the points of the videos
This course aggregates a lot of best practices how to learn better. Barb goes in deep explanations how our brains are working on both high and low levels. Seems like fall of the course mostly targeted for sturends
well presented overview of learning how to learnvalidated many skills and added a few otherstouched on the neuroscience of how we learn which was informative and enlighteningi will recommend this course to others
One should take this course in order to overcome the fear of learning any difficult skill or subject.It provides very helpful information pertaining to our common learning patterns and mistakes we do in studying.
This course offers up concepts and ideas that con propel a student's college experience. The concepts are used throughout out the course within their own "tests" for the class. Practical and well worth the time.
There are a lot of additional reading that could have been included in the course. The course could have been more detailed as opposed to using analogies and a long list of technique can be suggested at the end.
I was a habitual procrastinator and I found this course very helpful in solving the problem faced by me. I consistently make use of the learning techniques which has had a profound effect on my learning ability.
First of all, I would like to thank the teachers of this course. This course helped me to explore new techniques for learning new subjects and how to tackle the new challenges by my newly acquired set of skills.
Very interesting to know more about learning. Very simple and down to earth, don't expect a Master Degree level type of course. But good course for everybody curious and willing to improve their learning skills.
Very practical and best steps to learn effectively and remember with active practices and express wisely in tests. This is very helpful not only in academics but all parts of human life. Thanks to Team Coursera
Some incredibly useful advice and learning experiences. Some videos have questionable benefit to assisting in learning, though I suppose they allowed me to use my Diffuse Mode to understand the material better.
Well-explained and easily-applicable methods for learning better. Applicable to any forms of learning from standarized tests to language learning. Lot of extra video/reading links that are interesting as well.
Short and sweet. Gives you at least a handful of techniques that will help improve the learning process. Just as important as the techniques is the WHY behind them. This course does a good job covering the it.
I liked the course very much.I food it very difficult to build the castle and to use the spatialized techniques.Perhaps examples on HOW to do ti as an additional video material would have helped me very much.
this course really helped me correct some of the bad learning habits that i used to have  , and i have already noticed a remarkable improvement in my way of studying and in my results ; so thank you so much .
Everything was clearly explained. It included the most beneficial learning techniques. The interviews with these incredible people could be more useful not just repeating and confirming the course materials.
I really feel like I learned some new strategies for learning, studying, and test taking in this course.  I haven't been doing it wrong all these years but it seems like I could've been doing it much better.
Its an awesome course it really helps you a lot to impure your tough subjects and to sharpen your mind. Thanks a lot for this wonderful course and I must say the lectures were so good your so good barbara...
This really help you how to approach  to any kind of problem  you to solve.This course tells you that you can learn anything, just they tell the technique how to approach the particular problem or any task.
Very helpful for all ages and disciplines.Interview
with legendary persons is unique in this course.I wanted to see more on memory techniques, but I guess this will
stretch the course further.Thanks Barbara
Enjoyed this course, really good for those who are studying or returning to study. It has a lot of interesting facts and useful advice about learning that I believe will help me with my studies and beyond.
Simple and useful ideas and practices. helps you to understand why your learning has NOT always been successful in the past, and provides excellent pointers on how to learn and retain what you have learnt.
It changes the way I approaching the learning. This training is very helpful to enhance my learning skills. Definitely all the concepts explained in the training will help my future learnings effectively.
It was a good course I think have good materials of analyzis but I think I needed more practice, like more practice and thinks to be applying at the same time as homework to make more at learn by yourself
There are several useful ideas discussed in this course. I suspect that most stronger students use some methods already. I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about teaching and learning.
Fantastic..I cant but rave about Barbara Oakley and the calm approach she has adopted on teaching this course. Its truly inspiring and very useful. I will revisit this course to review these inputs again.
Great course that offers many useful scientific facts about your brain and tricks you can use to improve your study and fight procrastination.  View your leaning style from a whole different perspectives.
Very interesting!!Little lessons and tips, that may help you to really learn thing you are interested in.Also a supporting course that may encourage people to learn new things, and explore unknown fields.
This was an extraordinary topic to get familiar with. My personal opinion is to make the videos a bit longer to talk more about the concept in depth, this seems completely more or less like an overview..
Enjoyed the course, and learned several techniques to help me study and learn efficiently. The course offers a ton of resources to utilize and that help reinforce learning. Thanks for the weekly updates.
Very useful series of lectures, especially given their brevity. I happened to have developed many of these habits on my own, but I expect the new ideas I was exposed to will serve me well in the future.
I still did not finish all the course, but uptill now it is beneficial and loaded with precious information about our brain mechanismsm, which are explained in an easy applicable and understoodable way.
You can learn a lot from the course, at first it might not look extraordinary but it's the practice of these methods which will keep you amazed. Thanks a lot for spreading such wonderful courses around.
I have learned many useful methods and got a big picture about the process of learnng. However, I have some problems to see videos. So I pay someone to download videos. Except this, everything is great.
The course is great with many helpful ideas but it would be perfect if it just offered more learning techniques and tools. I really enjoyed it. The presentation is great and the course itself is awesome
Nice, really in depth course! I learned a lot of new things that I didn't know before about learning and the instructor makes the course in such an engaging way that understanding the material is easy!
This course is necessary in sharpening learning skills and test taking techniques. The scope of the course enables the student to development effective leading strategies whilst avoiding the bad ones.
what most important I learned from this course is; actually two things...1 changing your thoughts will change your life2 you have not learned something unless you can teach it to others.many thanks...
I hope to have gained some useful tools to beat my procrastination; at the very least this course has given me the ability to identify when I slip into procrastinating and methods to break that cycle.
The course has a powerful insight about it's core subject and I strongly recommend it. After week 3 it start's circling around. It could be done on two weeks instead of four. But it's a great course.
first mooc for me - it got me to the end with pleasure. And I think it motivated me to continue learning and try those presented concepts or continue using them when I was allready using them before.
I really learned some good stuff to use in during my study. Chunking and step away from the material p.e. Thank you Barbra, you nearly feel like family after al those video's.Lydia - the Netherlands
The course equipped me with alternative strategies that enhance my learning quality. As an aspiring faculty, and author , it provided me with the scientifically proven strategies to solve a problem.
I would like some tips for standarize tests, like the GMAT and GRE where timing is crucial, and you don´t have the opportunity to apply some techniques like start hard and jump to an easy question.
The course is really great. It helped me to overlook my studying techniques and find new ways of learning. I liked the style of teaching and interesting concepts that were proposed during lectures.
Very simple and to the point-- I found the info on procrastination most helpful. Wish there had been more of the neuroscience information that was briefly provided in the male professor's lectures.
Refreshing view on learning techniques, if only I had these tools/tips when I was cramming as an undergraduate, I would have had a much easier (and more effective) experience.   Highly recommended.
Thankful for Professor Oakley and Professor Sejnowski for teaching about learning. I'm more confident in making more progress in learning now that I understand how our mind works better. Thank you!
This site is useful if you want to learn how your brain works and to find out new learning techniques. There should be more available languages. All in all it is good practise to fill this course.
Excellent course in understanding how our brain works in learning. It really provides some great knowledge that, if applied, can change your life to the better and improve your chances in success!
An amazing course with interesting information on how our brain works. Truly grateful to the intractors, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and of course the Coursera org. Thank you!!!
Learned a lot about the challenges we all face when it comes to learning new or difficult  subjects. Having the tools now that I obtained during this course will help me in my studies and exams.
Easy understanding thanks to a direct and simple explanation. There are several advices and techniques to apply not only in our studies but also in the working life.
Thanks a lot. 
Best Regards.
Very interesting course, which has helped me be more cognizant of how I'm processing things.  It also confirmed some beliefs I have about how my mind works (which is just like everyone else's!).
It is a great course. It teches you how your brain works so you can take advantage to learn better. It would be a lot better if it includes exercises on how to improve each aspect of ours brain.
Good,practical, insightful and usable. Challenges some old methods and points to more effective ones. Would have liked  more intensity, action points and tools to have given it a 5 star rating.
the course hasn't started yet but, the ideas that the professors gave me in the lectures were amazing. I am eager to see the videos that come next. I hope it helps me in unlocking my potential.
This Course is so Fun! and i Gained from this lectures many new information! in the same time, i I expected more information and more complex and practical exercises, and a Certificate.Thanks.
I have taken study skills courses before and they were bring and dull. I thoroughly enjoyed the theory,science and presentation of this course. I learned many great new techniques, Thank you!
this course is very good i learned few things i will try them in my studying and i have learned some techniques about studying and passing the exams thinks a lot for this exciting experiment
So simple only later you learn how much you learned - not only for specific needs in academia but for life! Very sympathetic teachers and inspiring interviews guide you through and spark joy
I'm very happy, the course looks me like very interesting. I hope use the knowledge and give it to my nephews and people around me.
I want give a special thanks about translation to Spanish.
Many interesting topics and tips for studying - I wish I had taken this course as a foundation course when starting University, it would have made the next 4 years study much more effective!
Overall, it is a good lesson about learning, even though it's a little bit academical. It helps you know how the brain work and some skills for learning, procrastination and test technique.
it is very hepful to study the difficult subjects,helps to plan how to study ,how to remember and how to iconcentrate .This course guides not only students but also all learners.thank you
Excellent course for the beginer . Though th concepts are easy to grasp, putting it into practice requires a lot of unlearning and relearning from the learner .thanks Barbara and Terrence
The book, A Mind For Numbers, and this class are near identical, both are very good and I do recommend you use both, this course has a lot of additional resources in the additional videos
Interesting concepts on how to learn effectively.  The earlier we understand these concepts, the better for us to grasp topics for life and be comfortable learning anything under the sun.
very good comprehensive class. i have been studying about memory & learning for sometime and was pleasantly surprised when almost all topics i had came across was under this single class.
This was a very enlightening course.  The concepts and approaches are already proving to be very useful in my daily life as I learn the many new skills needed to stay relevant in my work.
questions focus only on what said in videos ,that is was not good for me a i should learn not save information and repeat them there were quizes that i did ,but in the end i did it again
The teacher is really sweet and tries her hardest for anyone watching to really understand the topics.I liked that every video is only about 7 minutes long which is helpful for learning.
The course is fine. I completed it with 88.6% marks with honors but can't see in the certificate as mentioned on the honors content. I don't know where to report. please see the matter.
Some concept doen't make a lot of sence. But the majority of tricks and tips are very usefull. This course is a must have in the list of copleted courses. Teach you how to really learn.
This would be a great course for someone towards the end of school or attending college/university. There is definitely valuable insight to be gained but it feels a little slowly paced.
Course is great. I have one complaint though. Mind mapping is absolutely a brilliant technique but only when done at the end of studying a subject trying to fit together all the pieces.
This course has helped me see where I had been learning using correct and incorrect methods.  I will be able to apply some of what I have learned in this course to my students.  Thanks
one of the best ,most important courses that everyone should take ,a lot of new information that would really help you to learn more deeply and learn efficiently,THANK YOU; BARB ,TERRY
A nice little course which I felt has changed my perspective on how to be an effective learner. Certainly, I will be experimenting with the techniques in the course in my own learning.
An insightful course which helped me to pursue my learning with confidence even when it does not seem to work properly. My conclusion after this course is: Be aware of your "mechanism"
I rated this course at a four-star because of the high informational content included. I really enjoyed it and was intrigued by the tips and facts in this course. Thank you very much.
Everyone can Learn and achieve great skills if they are committed to make it happen. One of the Great Course Online For Understanding Mental pattern and rewiring it for our Progress.
The facilitators are full of heart.They´ve put hard work into this.I´d go for something a bit more flashy and less academic looking but that´s me.Thanks Ms Oakley and Prof Sejnowsky!
Intresting and worthwhile course for all who want to be more efficient in learning and in work. The Course content about brain activity  and tricks are helful and useful by easy way.
It was a really wonderful course and gave me a lot of experience. I would like to thank the Corsera platform and give the Syrian Rally and recommend everyone to this exciting course
learning how to learn is very useful and powerful mental tools that helped me to understand the best way of learning. thanks for coursera.org and university of california, san diego
very good course , a powerful tool to know and master how we can employ our learning process in order to maximise the understanding in the long term with certain proven techniques.
This is an excellent course, both in terms of content and delivery, but also in terms of the generous amount of useful tools and tips that can be easily applied in our daily lives.
Really good course and concepts! Thanks for all the information given. I'm sure I am going to take a lot of the techniques and learning into my professional life and study options.
This course was extremely helpful in analyzing  strategies and very well researched! I appreciated the course very much and all of the work that must have gone into it. Thank you!!
The course was indeed excellent. The course provides scientifically proven techniques to improve ones ability in effective learning and some amazing facts on how our brain works !
it is great to learn about the method of learning and how to improve ourselves by using different approach to handle various problem.THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS WONDERFUL COURSE
It has helped me discipline myself on how to effectively learn new things and retain them.  The script helps whenever I am challenged in understanding what the speaker is saying.
Overall very good course. Did a good job creating a general (this is the tricky part) template for effective learning. Not 5 stars because I don't agree with all that was said :)
Many new methods learnt from this course, what i though i know was so little, this course taught me many new ways of tackling not just tests but other learning outcomes i wanted.
It was a great learning experience. Helped me brush my basics that we miss out on in today's world. Thank you to the professors for all the guidance and help. Regards, Pooja Dali
Good group of tools for learning, if you are interested in the self-development this course is a summary  when comes to interdisciplinary subjects in neuroscience and psychology.
i learnd to much from this course, i learnd new things that i do not know before, it changed my studying way , and opend my eyes and brain to learn more about learning, thank you
EXCELLENT COURSE ABOUT IMPROVE LEARNING. I like Course put subtitles in Spanish language. Sometimes I can not understand all the American English and I check it in the subtitles.
This course on learning was actually very informative and helpful. I see myself implementing these techniques more with my other courses and just in life, in general. Thank you.
Good content and tips though the presentation was rather dull at times and used very old and outdated visual methods. I did learn a lot though and I will implement those things.
A very good and useful course! Took 1 star because some parts don't feel as good as others, quizes are too easy, and during my session there was nobody to give me a peer review.
This course is extremely helpful for those students who don't know how to learn in a scientific way. However, I would like to see more practical examples included in the course.
Very interesting topics with mesmerizing analogies that really helps you to understand and learn the concepts given by the course. Also great tips on how to improve in learning.
Barbara Oakley has a very nice voice to listen to and she explains thiings very well. It is an addicting course which makes your more curious and willing to learn more and more!
This motivated me to pick up science and Mathematics once again. I don't agree with everything taught in this course but one must learn to take everything with a pinch of salt.
This course was very valuable to me but it will be more effective if there is a project at the end of the course where every one try to apply what he have learned in the course
Modules are easy to understand and logically taught, lecturers have an understanding of teaching and teaching material which in itself is necessary! Well spoken and articulate.
Good course to understand basics of memory and functioning of brain. It helps to make the learning schedules and adopt methods that help understand and memorize the concepts.
It is a very good course to understand how learning works and how we should proceed. I am enlightened after completing this course and has a positive effect on my daily life.
Good paced, with very interesting material. Learned both new ideas and also understood older ideas that i didn't quite have a good explanation for. Thanks for a great course.
A very well-paced course with plenty of examples and practice. Hopefully, I will be able to use some of the tools I learned. I already started to visualize more what I read.
An interesting approach to understanding human psychology in the context of learning, would recommend this course to people interested in improving their learning abilities.
Read Dr. Oakley;s book "A Mind for Numbers." Tooks this course's quizzes to test my recall on the book's material. Passed without viewing any of the lectures. Well worth it.
It's a great course.It changes the perspective of the way we learn and the ways which we thought obsolete were the best ways to learn. The best course that I had ever taken.
Specially, this course is for the beginners who wants to understand the concept of how to learn. Tutors really did a good job to represent the topics in very effective way.
The course was very informative,.I wish it would've had more activities, but what I learned I have applied it to the other courses that I started after completing this one.
A little bit boring because the videos are very similar in style so there is less focus after a while. Other than that great course and I learned a lot useful ways to study
Some material is trite and repetitive, but overall, "Learning How to Learn" provides a useful framework for understanding the mind and offers some useful test-taking tips.
informative and well structured, it was helpful in getting back to engaging and taught me some tricks in taking notes and got me to recognize my triggers to procrastinate.
Excellent course, got some methodologies that changed my learning way. Although it was having some biological terms about the brain that were not necessary in this course.
Dedicated and passionate teachers and lots of useful infos. The tests could be a bit harder and the slides seem to be straight out of the 90s :) Anyway a very nice course.
One of those courses that push your thoughts about how are you really handling your long-life education and how to obtain information with less efforts, more efficiently.
Very good content and teachers.  The video production was a bit poor though, but in general is a very good course and everyone who has difficulty learning should take it.
This course help me to understand reasoning behind why we face obstacles while learning. It also point out to multiple techniques which can help you learn in better way.
Often, the instructors voice is difficult to catch. Other than that, this course was perfect and helped me a lot to understand the best practice of learning ! Thank you.
Learned some interesting tips about better test taking and retention. I found it very practical. I would recommend it to anyone but especially to postsecondary students.
Excellent course, lots of relevant examples and helpful tips. I wish I had of been shown the course earlier, it would have help significantly pre-high school or college.
The course is very good but it's too general and we want it to give examples in many specializations or to be numerous versions of this course each for a different major
very good course. scientific and systematic learning experience. i personally learned a lot about working of brain in learning. procrastination topic is dealt very good.
It is the first course i have taken on something related to learning i found many key tips and i am sure i can get tremendous help in my career while executing the tips
Strong advice, sometimes it would help to have a little more of a bigger perspective, maybe including references to mythology, psychoanalysis and other "meta-sciences".
It's my first course here and it was a very good one to start learning, the learning techniques educated here is very useful and also very easySo Recommended to enroll
Excellent course, I learned a lot, very practical to anyone because we should keep learning our entire life, and here you can learn the best way to do it. Recommended.
It was very great experience to learn how to learn! Thanks to the Prof. Barbara Oakley for making all the things understandable as well as enthusiastic...Thanks a lot
I enjoyed taking this course. I'm writing this about a year later, and I'm still mindful of the concepts of active recall, interleaved learning and spaced repetition.
Great course on our ability to continuously learn more and more efficiently. I enjoyed Prof. Barbara Oakley's lectures the most. Well balanced and structured overall.
A great course for everyone interested in learning. I learned a lot but we'll see how much I implement. I wish there was more of a practical component to the course.
i found it interesting it deserve to be reading because it will help you to master though topics and show you how to use your brain in order to learning how to learn
Really good and practical suggestions about improving the way you learn and actually retain the knowledge! Easy pace, helpful hints and insights. Highly recommended!
Good course, I guess I knew a lot going in, but it was still useful and gave me reassurance on the ways I studied. Really good for students getting back into school.
This has given me much insight into learning. I am using what I learned in my studies and am grateful for having the opportunity to have done this course. Thank you.
Barely anything you don't already know or do subconsciously. But the little that you don't know, will help you understand and remember new concepts more effectively.
Overall the course is great. Personally, the video backgrounds in most of Barbara's videos were eye irritating. The colour should be mild, not bright green or blue.
Really one of the best teachers teach you here to learn effectively and those techniques really work. So glad i did this course. Everyone should go for this course.
A good course, but designed more for college students early in their career and not as helpful for graduate/medical students (though I still picked up a few tips!)
Very enjoyable introduction to some of the neurology and psychology of learning. Helpful tips on overcoming coming challenges to learning, such as procrastination.
This course has helped me to approach learning new things with fresh perspectives. I wish I had the opportunity of this course when I was in my school and college.
At 51 years old I have learned there is much more to learning, more of an efficient skill and methodology , than a drawn out complex process.   Thank you, Charles.
Going through the lessons calms my mind. If you're stressed by your school work/life, doing this course may bring some peace to your mind. Barbara has a zen vibe.
This is a must do course, very informative and it gives a clearn understanding how the brain works and practical ideas oh learning how to learn. Excellent course.
It was a good Course, although many of the topics covered I have already learned before, I found some very useful new techniques and insight for better learning.
A very helpful course for anyone to take. The learning environment is relaxed and positive, but some of the test questions seem like giveaways from time to time.
Has very useful concepts in tackling how to learn. Although I believe the material can be trimmed a bit and distilled down to something shorter than what it is.
Useful course for learning, although some tips are quite obvious. It is useful to know how the brain works and what you can do for a better learning experience.
This is really a good course, through which I do learn a lot about how to study more effectively. And this course won't take too much time, so enroll right now！
It was perfect, but informations could be passed more efficiently (informations may have more compacted form - videos would be shorter without missing any fact)
This is a great course! But fails on the quality of its videos. Apart from that is great, and an amazing tool to think how my studying process can be improved.
a very brilliant step to make people aware about techniques of learning. Thanxs for your valuable efforts to boost my professional thrust to learn how to learn
i don't really understand the way "biology things", but this course gave much analogy to us and help to build the understanding of each materials for usthanks
It's a very nice course. Gives you a new perspective towards learning. It has told me some good techniques which I can implement to learn knew things. Thanks.
Good overall. I had been utilizing these techniques without knowing it. I think would be good to summarize everything in a page or two long PDF pretty easily.
Interesting course which helps you to improve your learning skills. I highly recommend reading the suggested book by Professor Oakley parallel to this course!
Good basic knowledge but I felt that I already knew most of it. Still very well put together and definetly recommend it to high school or university students.
Veru interesting to understand in a light way how our brain works when we are trying to learn. Great teachers and easy-to-understand examples and explanations
A very great course, indeed. My sincere congratulations to all people who were able to make it. This is the best course have ever done.Millions of thanks!!!
I love the content of the course, I would like to see the teacher Oakley more happy about herself, she does a tremendous work and she does not project that.
Wow.....an eye-opener, i think everyone interested in learning how to learn better and effectively should not leave out this course.All the best, prospects.
Great content and great tutors, however the quality of production could have been better. But this doesn't really impact overall experience of this course.
Great and useful techniques to apply in your daily learning process. Also good insights about how does the brain work (including in procrastination states)
Some useful points, however I wish they taught the class more generally. The focus on classes and exams tests isn't as useful after you've finished school.
As we are constantly learning new things this is useful in many different levels and situations, should be a recommended entry course when new to Coursera.
really practical and interesting course. I learn better now and get less frustrated when i forget something, because I know how learning works now. Thanks!
The videos were incredibly helpful, especially the visual aids aids and examples used. The course conductors took time to explain concepts in simple ways.
I was always looking for the MOOC that will teach me to how the process of learning works and that's the choice I was found out in the form of this MOOC.
The facts about how brain work while learning was very interesting.But actually I hardly learnt any new, maybe I just learn better, thant I thought I do.
THIS COURSE IS VERY USEFUL FOR PERSON WHO HAS NO IDEA OR CONFUSION ABOUT SOMETHING NOT ONLY IN LEARNING BUT ALSO IN LIFE ,  I AM REALLY ENJOY THIS COURSE
Really helpful. Especially the focus and diffused concept and the timer for procrastination. However I would like to have seen more examples of chunking.
Should have known these techniques before i started high school. Techniques i learned here have helped me to Increased my learning performance immensely.
Super helpful to understand how the brain works with pragmatic tips for how to learn effective.  I'm now making my school age kids go through the videos!
It was very helpful though I could not stick to the timeline. I learned a lot and I am hoping it will help me at present and the future. Thanks you guys.
Very good course, fairly straightforward but a good beginner topic for those interested in Learning, how the Brain works and getting into Neurosciences.
It would be better for tests after the videos quiz to be more difficult and challenging. But I enjoyed the course, thank you very much for your efforts.
It was put together really well, I enjoyed it. Thank you to the instructors for giving this out to anyone who has internet access. It is really helpful.
This course help me have knowledge of neuron science, basement of learning method, Why and how,  we can apply in learning new things with growth mindset
It is useful to reorganise all the useful method for memorizing and linking up chunks for better ideas. Tips for tackling procrastination would be good.
I learned so much and this was the perfect course to get me started. I am ready to take more coursera courses.  Great, friendly, educational professors.
Fantastic course which provides learners with plentiful resources and extra credit to help complement their studies to help embed what they're learning.
Very well done. Put together in a way that takes you from beginning to end with giving you helpful tips along the way to become successful in learning.
It's not quite as in depth as I would've liked, but it still drastically shaped my studying patterns and has made me a much better student and learner.
A great introduction of techniques about how to learn new subjects. It was great to have both professors, and the way it was passed to us, was amazing.
this course was very useful,it allowed me to recognise why procrastination happens and how to avoid it and be a better learner. it was very insightful
I learnt quite a bit in this course especially highlighting what I have been doing wrong in my studying and how to better make use of the methods that
Learned a great deal about my brain and the way learning is shaped by how my brain functions. Great explanations and great speaker. Thanks Dr. Oakley!
It is knowledge about how to learn very nicely brought to you - but it is a little bit to basic in my humble opinion. Still - a great course to take!
If you care about this class it will do wonders for you, but the desperate student who just wants an easy way out will never prevail with this class.
I like Learning How to Learn because it has so many good ways to develop and maximize your learning on so many different levels. Keep learning, Barb!
Loved the learning tips and tricks, the teachers however had many under developed  on camera skills. (or there were bad mics for one of the teachers)
there are many interesting ideas and concepts,so I apply them in my daily life; therefore, my way of studing has changed since this course was taken.
Intuitive yet powerful ideas and techniques! Hopefully by applying those methods study can be more effective and productive. Thanks for instructing!
Likely best suited for junior and high-school students.  Enjoyable and quick course, though very much an overview course at a simple level of depth.
The presenters are a little stilted in their speech but the subject matter is extremely useful. This is a course I believe everyone can benefit from
This course contains helpful tips and tricks for how our brains work and the simplest ways to learn or get a great experience before taking an exam
I was extremely happy with this course. I have learnt much which I will share with others. A big thank you to Ms. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
This course gave me insight on how simple changes on our learning styles, test preparation and even in daily life can have lots of positive impact.
The course is quite helpful in shaping the way of thinking. By applying these ideas into practice, it would largely benefit an individual's future.
This course is good but I can't say it's perfect. The information given in this course is rather obvious to anyone who can use their common sense.
Great to choose this course and have a better understanding of techniques of learning. The interviews sharing are interesting. Enjoy and Rejoice!
I enjoyed the course, and I found the material to be useful and relevant for future use by just about everybody at some point in their lifetimes.
Enjoyable course, good pointers to learn. For me, it was a good break from studying hard, getting a little mental pause, while learning to learn.
Useful, mostly common sense, but I definitely picked up a few new tips, and as explained in the course, a small change can make a big difference.
great course| insightful |  great collection of techniques and interviews| instructor were smart and passionate | too long though but worth it |
If you have never been exposed to structured methods of learning, this is a great course. A great refresher for those wanting to learn anything.
I wish It had more examples on how to use these techniques in school but overall it really helped and I think I am doing better in school now :D
Helps in understanding where our learning process drifts away. Useful course to understand and make use of our brain and extract its potential.
It's really helpful to students. How the students build their ability to perform tough problem to solve by using of Pomodoro Techquiche. etc...
Really interesting course. It would be perfect if the students can find very simple slides without too much word, but with images and examples.
it gives good imputs. However, it looks to me that it is directed more to science, math, engeneering students than students of social sciences.
Really enjoyed taking this course. The lessons were thorough, short and easy to understand. I would definitely recommend this class to others!
Very interesting course. Challenging in the beginning for me because it was my first course online. Looking forward to starting another course
Techniques described in this course helped me in my studies and in the development of the skills that were invaluable in my professional life.
Nice course, should be shorteden because the amount of informations is smaller than I expect but I still recommend (if you speed up videos :D)
The teachers are really good and the information given is helpful. However the lessons are a little short, they could go deeper in the topics.
I thought it was well thought out. However, I can't say that I agreed with all of the research and statements but I did learn from it. Thanks!
Absolutely great course, I wish I had learnt this when I was younger, my life would have definitely taken a different path. Thank you Barbara
Very nice course. I'd recommend it to everyone. I think the length of the course should be a bit more. but still, it's a life-changing course
Worthwhile both as a primer to the platform and the utility of it and as a solid foundation with plenty of tips and peaks behind the curtain.
good thing to show the point which everybody may know but not think about that.Encourage everyone to fight with yourself to achieve the goal.
Oh, this course is a master piece for everyone who struggles with learning anything, not just science, math and physics but almost any field.
Please provide the certification is free. I am coming from developing country so we are not able to pay this much amount.Please make it free.
Very helpful. I didn't like example of famous persons, because these are really not encouraging.And I didn't like mnemotechnics -- it's evil.
It is very good course for all age people to get good techniques to improve the way of learning.All techniques discussed are easy to follow.
Very good course. I wish this was around when I was in high school and college. I think it would have made a big difference in my education.
I like how the course was supplied with anecdotes because it makes it easier to apply the lesson. Please make the interviews more organized.
I enjoyed this course and the quizzes never failed to make me chuckle! I have learnt a lot that will come in great use. Thank you very much

I often tell others that the greatest lesson I learned by going to college was "learning how I learn best." And yet, when I reflect on my undergraduate career (I graduated in 2012), it occurs to me that I didn't truly reach my potential as a learner. The flawed learning techniques I gleaned in high school stayed with me for my college years -- I crammed nightly before exams; I took cursory looks at a homework set's answer key and convinced myself that I knew the topic; rather than admit to myself that I was letting procrastination get control over my life, I convinced myself that, "I work well under a little pressure," or that I simply didn't "have time to go to review sessions/attend office hours/review my work/etc." I may have been able to graduate with decent grades, but I certainly couldn't recall from memory the majority of the work I did.And so, I've been left feeling like I've failed myself; like I didn't truly achieve my potential as a learner. "Who would I be today," I sometimes muse, "if only I applied myself and gave learning my all?" But I can't play the "woe is me" game anymore. I may have not taken advantage of the learning opportunities I had at the time, but I can certainly do better for myself going forward.Taking Dr. Oakley's course, supplemented by reading her book, "A Mind for Numbers" has changed my life. It's altered my perspective about learning and memory, and it's given me insight into how brains learn best, and how I can maximize my success and efficiency when it comes to learning. To give you an idea of the impact of Dr. Oakley's insight on my life: I originally borrowed her book "A Mind for Numbers" from my local library; when I finished it, I immediately bought a copy for my personal collection -- in part, to have on hand, should my friends and family ask to read it; but more importantly, I bought the book to serve as a reference for myself in the years to come, when I may need to remind myself on the best tips and methods for learning. This course taught me how to learn, something I took for granted during my formative educational years. I can't wait to see where I end up in the future, now that I'm armed with the tools, techniques, and resources I need to succeed!
Great course. Took it since it was the most popular MOOC on coursera,. Have started using a few of the techniques and they are very effective. Highly recommended no matter who you are and what you do.
I don't write reviews very much so i will be brief.Taking out time for this course will be the best investment in your life. Wonderful ,helpful , Useful , Insightful , it's full of everything desired.
I specially like the optional interviews. These learning case studies are quite insightful and you might just find a something that you can relate to, which might help in the grand scheme of things :)
I am a more effective learner as a result of this course. It has also, surprisingly, increased my enjoyment while learning. Thanks to Barbara and Terry for a well presented and informative production.
This is an amazing class. It makes my professional life easy as well as my personal life. Everybody should take this class, and also the teachers are brilliant about all subjects that we see in class.
This course was eye-opening. I learned so many great techniques that I can immediately incorporate into my daily life. Thank you so much to the creators of this course for such invaluable information.
First MOOC that I can accomplish, even in my busiest days, because I'm motivated to learn the lessons taught in it and I like the teacher and class format (small videos and always repeating concepts).
I enjoyed this course so much. I learned a lot about how I can become a better learner. This course was very interesting and useful. I have some tools that I can use to optimize my learning potential.
I found this course incredibly useful and practical. It has not only helped me better understand the process of learning but it has also given me valuable tools in how to optimize my learning process.
This course was the first one I took in Coursera, and I'm glad to have been a part of it. Both Barbara and Terry are great teachers whose videos were a delight to listen to. They have given me tons of tricks to apply while studying and I have no doubt that these will come in handy. Thank you!
This is an amazing course. The design, flow and videos help gain understanding of the content in a seamless manner. The learning is highly engaging because of the simplicity of concept and the clarity of ideas provided right from the beginning of the course. Regular assessments and options to study additional content makes the learning more fun and exciting. The best part of this course is that one can apply the learnings of this course to anything and everything that you are learning or wish to learn. This is must do course for anyone who wants to keep learning in this journey of life
I really appreciate the time these guys invested in this course and am willing to take it again if they re-explain some topics in order to refresh some things that with time haven't stayed in my mind.
It was a wonderful journey of learning how to learn. Simple and effective. Wish i had come across something like this a little early in life. But better late than never. Keep up the good work. Thanks.
This is a course which I enjoyed. It gave a good insight of the learning methodologies which we have often heard of but not given due importance. Also, the brain facts is cool :) My 5/5 to this course
This Course Is awesome it gave me a new look on how my brain works and that i should actually take breaks which is probably why i get frustrated. I am Excited to Put what i have learned into practice.
Amazing course, I learned a lot of new techniques for self motivation, and effecient learning. Now, I feel more confident to take further steps in improving and developing myself. Thank you so much :)
Fantastic well-structured course with talented instructors! Some of the techniques mentioned changed my life!
this course is great!  I actually already know some of these Technics and concepts before i went into this course but this course did such a great job of explaining it the now it really sticks with me.
This course provides soft skills needed for continuous improvements which enhance my learning capabilities. It covers conceptual and practical approach to learn effectively and efficiently. Thank you!
I found this course to be incredibly helpful. I am 33 and wish that I would have been taught a more efficient way of learning many years ago. There are definitely some great takeaways from this class.
This class really focused on the process of learning.  It taught me so much.  I even shared ideas with my college and high school student.  They were surprised as some concepts were helpful to them also.
Really useful insights had been provided by this course. No price can be put on this valuable resource. It's beyond anything valuable. Thank you very much for making this course. God Bless Everyone :)
This course showed me powerful tools to enhance my performance and to achieve a better life quality. My children and my future students will also be positively influenced by your course. Thanks a lot!
It is great learning course brought me clear understanding strong structure of how to learn more effective. I regret only about one, that I didn't passed this course when I started learning at school.
At some point, I questioned my brain´s hability to hold information. I felt frustrated by not being able to retain information effectively and  ended up having the felling that I wasted the time studying something that weeks later I would have forgotten. However, after taking this wonderful and extremely useful course, I am aware that the problem was not my ability to learn or something related to my brain, but instead I realized I have not being using the right tools to enhance my learning process and achieve better results. Learning is the most important tool to develop mastery in any field. Unfortunately at school we are not though how to learn, and this course without a doubt provides a deep understanding of how our brains and memory works, and more importantly it provides several tools that are easily applicable in learning any subject increasing the changes to succeed. Thanks a lot Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for sharing such a powerful knowledge and tools.
The most useful topic for me was how to treat "procrastination." Through this course, I noticed that I have more time for study than I thought. It happened because I could tackle procrastination. Other topics - focus mode and defuse mode, self-testing, working memory and long-term memory- were all interesting and useful for me. Thank you!
I loved it very much , it helped me in improving my skills and trying to find my passion by learning and have a great energy to do great things , it  is my pleasure to have this course from you doctors
Exceptional course. I work on personal development now for 13 years, have for example read from scott h young a decade ago - and now he is interviewed here and mentioned. Great to see one of my "teachers" featured here. I have a bachelors and masters degree, recently got some more hard certifications (AWS cloud architect and developer) and needed a way to even learn more and more efficiently in the future both for work / career and personal life. iI want to learn davinci resolve video cutting, improve in photography, photoshop. lightroom. As mentioned, i have been working towards personal dvelopment for 13 years, read though about 50 books and 1000 pages of blog posts, but never retained much info - now i have the tools to retain that info, test myself on it, and use spaced repetition to retain it for a decade. Discuss it with my wife to even more deepen the knowledge. Use pomodoro and other techniques to really do my courses 100 percent and not loose interest after 10%.Thanks Barbara and Terence for this great course which is a lifechanger for me even after i already gained so much knowledge in my past 38 years on this earth.This course should be mandatory in every school education all of the world as it explains the PROCESS of learning and not just focused on the PRODUCT. I wish, i knew about this course when i was 15 or even 20 years only (now that i am 38).
I decided to take several online courses to help advance my career, and all of them are new subjects to me.  When I was at school, I had no problem passing all the tests needed, but I don't feel I retained the knowledge as well as some of my classmates did after the semester (and all the tests) was (were) over.  Nowadays in real life, there are projects to be completed and I kept on procrastinating to the last minute.  It's rather stressful to handle work responsibilities this way.  I am grateful that this course provides many practical techniques that I can utilize in my daily work and my self-learning plans, from how to avoid procrastination, how to retain more from what is learned, to how to make weekly/daily learning plans.  Highly recommended to anyone who is serious about learning and is looking for strategies to learn effectively.
As someone who has taken "the science of everyday thinking" on EDX, I thought there'd be no online courses that are as insightful, transformative, and broadly applicable in life as it is until I discovered "Learning how to learn" on Coursera. Although both share some similar advice and tips, LHTL has a much more in-depth look at human brains' way of absorbing and processing information from a neuroscientific point of view. Not to mention that both instructors are highly respected and excellent at presenting knowledge throughout the whole course. I genuinely hope that this course can reach more and more people trying to lead a more productive and meaningful life.
This course provides excellent strategies to improve memory when learning and to increase understanding without spending hours studying material.  In addition, the course instructors do not waffle - they get to the point fast and so, this course does not feel heavy or boring to learn, but a large amount of valuable material IS covered!  There are a tonne of eclectic resources provided and learners can go as deep as they want into improving or developing their own learning techniques with guidance from this course.  I highly recommend this for educators as well as learners.
A very comprehensive course on the subject of learning. I have used the research-backed methods taught in this course to improve my learning and not only did I gain a better understanding of the material I was studying but as an adult/lifelong learner, I use the techniques in this course to retain a lot more of my daily reading on various subjects. I also strongly recommend (to everyone not just Math/Science majors) reading Dr. Barbara Oakley's  "A Mind for Numbers" - which is a very useful complementary text for the course.
I really loved this course. It wasn't love at first sight, of course, and the first date didn't catch me at all. But as I progressed, I became more and more interested, until I finally loved it.
It is a course that I recommend for people of all ages, as we are constantly learning throughout life. But I recommend it above all to parents, as this way they can guide their children much better in the learning process.
I would have loved to know this material long before, but it's never too late :) I learned a lot,
Thank you!
Thank you for this course. I've been out of the structured learning environment for a while now, and this course not only instilled some good learning habits (anybody can do one or two Pomodoro), knowing the why behind these habits helped. So now, when my brain gets foggy, I step away from my books / computer and go do something else that allows me to switch my brain to a different mode.
This course is really beneficial! I am so amazed that every statement here is based on proven scientific facts. And we can use every piece of knowledge from this course in our real life. I could not stop to return to this video day by day until I finished. It is really the first course on Coursera I have completed. I appreciate authors amazing work and look forward to Part II.
This is by far one of the best personal development courses I've completed. I hope I would have found this course earlier in my career.This is highly recommended to anyone, especially students who are in the path of learning so they can 'Learn how to Learn'.I'm going to ask my daughter to take this course as well.Thanks to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for design this course.
This is a brilliant course. It has taught me so much. Sometimes I was skeptical as when it was suggested that switching from focused to diffused mode of thinking can solve problems: but I tried it out and it really works! Chunking, memory, testing, procrastination avoidance etc.; all are covered and the techniques used allow you to really learn and master a subject.
This is THE BEST mooc course I have taken EVER. I congratulate Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for putting it together. I learnt so so much about my brain, how we learn as humans, overcoming the procrastination monster and helpful tips to pass tests and interviews. I rate it 10 Stars (Ok ok, There's no 10 star rating, so I'm giving it a FIVE)
This course was amazing!! Would recommend it to anyone. The professors Barbara Ma'am and Terry Sir were very engaging and really friendly. The tips given by them to avoid Illusion of Competence and Procrastination really proved to be helpful. If you are looking for some better ways to learn and to make most out of our study time, this course is for you.
The course was great, i see why it´s one of the most important on the web, i learned more about myself with the help of the videos and lectures that were very interesting and well planned, i will used the new knowledge on my day to day like in my university career and more on, hope to be a better person while achieving my objectives and goals.
As a lifelong learner I found this course extremely useful.It was worthy of investing my time in learning how to learn.I gained noteworthy takeaways from this course.Grateful to Dr,Oakley and Dr,Sejnovski for their excellent teaching.Much appreciated the interviews that associated the course.Highly recommended to everyo
Wonderful course to understand how to build sessions for different learners, what to incorporate in learning for maximising learning. From a student perspective I think a lot of what we have done in school but forget to do as adult learners, that we still need to be the child when it comes to learning
I think as human we constantly learning, but sometimes we learn hard but may not necessarily effective. Through this course, I learned the scientific reasons why some techniques are effective and some are not. I also learned simple techniques that I can apply in my learning process.
I wish I had known all these study techniques back in high school and college. It is not too late. With what I know now, I am looking forward to share what I learned. I am also confident that I can still learn new thing.  Thanks for sharing learning how to learn.
Course illustrated very effectively many enhanced approaches for successful learning processes based on neuroscience and proven methodologies.  Recommend this course for others who find their usual approaches to studying and learning to be less than satisfactory.
This course is really very helpful course. I suggest everyone to go through this course before enrolling any course. Because before learning we have to know properly how to learn. This course will help you to achieve this skill.
The course was amazing! Now I do know about my brain and how to control it. Looking forward to learn new amazing stuffs using the techniques I have learned through this course. Thank you very much to make a course like this.
This course opened my mind to understand me better, the ways I learn and respect my process learning, not focused in the product. I love it. Thank's Barbara to share this knowledge for free! I really appreciate it. <3
I wish this would be taught in schools at early age and through out. Many fail because many don't have a frame of study to rely on. This is a course that has help me have a more grounded study habit that works.
This course gave me a new perspective on how to approach learning anything new from now on. Would have loved to have been aware of the concepts and ideas discussed in these chapters while I was still in school!
Practical and simple - 1) outlines relatable misconceptions and 2) provides clear solutions that I'll surely apply to my own learning goals ASAP. Very few "filler" videos, which were interesting anyway.
This course accumulates a clear and valuable set of thoughts that structure knowledge about learning principles and tactics. Also, it was interesting to know some new things about how the brain works.
This course give me a new perspective about learning. give new spirit and motivation to start learning again, after 5 years i get graduated from college which i feel don't master my study material.
This was an amazing course! I've been doing so many of these techniques presented without ever knowing much about them! I'm so glad I took this class, it's very insightful, and helpful too.
Terrific - great overview of the basics of learning and memory complemented with practical tips for beating procrastination, effective studying, and test taking. Great course.
Great course, no matter how old you are this will help you understand better how to learn, what to do to be a better student and how to retain the information. i love it.
plenty of userful information about how brain works in terms of learning and lots of userful tricks how to organize yourself to be as much efficient as possible!
All the information in this course is VERY USEFUL. As a student and a teacher, I've learned a lot and have changed my way of learning and teaching. Thank you!
This course is remarkably densely packed with concrete techniques I am excited to apply (and am already starting to apply) in all my learning.
Who knew learning could be fun?!  I have been out of school for 20 years now and this was a great course to take to ease myself back in.
Anyone interested in improving their ability to learn should take this course. It stands alone as the single best resource available.
A great course for any person who wishes to get valuable tips on how to learn effectively and understand the process of learning.
Reading the book at the same time is great and made the  course very easy to understand. Thank you dear Barbara Oakley and Terry.
This is a basic skill for life. Everyone should learn this! How to learn any other skill and avoid procrastination.... Amazing!
Really refreshing and simple course that being said , it's a must have skill as simplicity is very hard to acquire nowadays!
This course helps me much. If someone follows this course outline, definitely she/he will learn something with great joy.
Interesting - and fun. You can't leave it without feeling your understanding of learning has changed for the better.
Great course and, as a teacher, has given me  scientific basis for the teaching methods we use in class.
Amazing course! This course is a must for everyone. The instructors are so friendly and knowledgeable.
This course provided helpful practical guidance and implementation of effective learning techniques.
A really useful and informative course with practical tips that I wished I was aware of years ago!
This course is very helpful. I should really start applying these techniques to my own learning!
Excellent course, very helpful and it gave me a point of view on how to do better on studies.
This is a great course for EVERYONE, who is willing to live a BETTER life. Thank you SO much.
This course is short and simple yet extremely powerful! It is definitely worth your time.
I am a high school teacher, and I learned so much more than I thought I would. Thank you.
Of of the best courses that i did. Both the instructors are amazing. Thank you so much.
A stellar course, I have no regrets taking it and I am very happy with what I learned!
I loved quiz questions and answers (some of the not correct one were hilarious).
Excellent.  I wish I could have taken this course when I was still in school.
An excellent course . Techniques are very useful which include in course.
I like it too much it is very helpful material ....thank you
THE coursee was awesome i have learned many new things

We love learning how to learn
Very good and usefull course!
It was FantasticThank you
Interesting and useful :D
Great course! LOVED IT!
Powerful mental tools!
It's amazing
I broke every rule of efficient and effective learning until I met this course, Dr. Barbara Oakley Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, and the book: “A Mind for Numbers”. I wish I had met your group and this powerful vehicle of learning earlier –university wouldn’t have been so costly (studying the inefficient way) and the rewards could be even more phenomenal with this awareness. Nevertheless, your incredible work will continue to help mitigate the cost.Although I maintained good grades through university primarily because of my high enthusiasm, interest and determination to achieve excellence in life–long learning, but the personal cost was undue stress –over studying, keeping many late nights, dependency on caffeine and life-work-family balance. However, I imagined there had to be a better way.The frustrations and occasionally being at my wits end in solving some of the problems in the computer programming languages I am currently learning have instantly dissipated because of this course. I have completely changed my old and inefficient learning methods and formed new habits for learning.Amazingly, I failed to solve the triangle problem on the first try at the end of a long day of work and study (after staring at it for about 45mins) in the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley. However, determined, I gave it another shot the next morning, right after waking up -it took me less than 30 seconds to solve. You’ve got to love the diffuse mode…While I love academia and stand ready to dance with whatever pain it dishes out at me in my life-long learning journey, this course has single-handedly removed current and whatever inherent or perceived pain that may be associated with life-long academic learning for me. There is a better way to rote learning method -a different, efficient and effective approach… Academic goal or any subject matter no longer need to take many years of painful endurance to achieve or master.This course has armed me with the ultimate set of tools to expertly construct efficient and effective learning methods with measureable success. Essentially, I have learned how to hack my academic growth and goal.Finally, in the past, I stumbled upon one or two of the methods taught in this course in academic journals and other articles. However, these occasional, inconsistent and isolated pieces of information were not cohesive to form a powerful enough force to help build a fundamental understanding and practice of efficient learning methods. Additionally, overpowering the well-formed habit of the inefficient rote learning method was a challenge. Fortunately, this course and the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley, compiled and put all of these scientific data on efficient learning methods in to proper perspective, easy enough for anyone to understand and practice. In the afterword chapter of the book, Dr. David B. Daniel said it best:“There has long been a stream of potentially productive study advice coming from scientists. Unfortunately, it has seldom been translated so the average student can easily grasp and use it. Not every scientist has a knack for translation, and not every writer has a firm grasp of the science. In this book, Barbara Oakley threaded this needle beautifully. Her use of vivid examples and explanations of the strategies reveals not only how useful but how credible these ideas are.”Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and the Learning How to Learn Team for a job well done! Your work is indelible in my mind and I can be certain, in others too.
This is the
first real elaborated review I´ve done in my life. That´s the kind of impact
this course can produce. I felt like I wanted to express my opinion about it
and my gratitude. If you are someone who likes learning or teaching, or need to
perform those activities in your everyday life for any reason, then you should
take this course without hesitation. The information given is so valuable and
eye opening. I personally like to read a lot and gain new knowledge about
anything, but I always had that little feeling that I was not being truly
efficient in doing it, that I was doing something wrong or, going further, that
I wasn´t capable or smart enough to retain the information I was trying to
learn, because I usually found myself investing a lot of time reading over and
over again a material to realize, weeks later, that I had forgotten almost all
of it. That, of course, caused me a lot of frustration. I used to feel that I
was wasting my time. I knew that the best way to learn something was trough
practice, but this course helped me understand how the process of learning
really works, the correct way of practicing and the mistakes people usually
make (illusions of learning).I had read years
ago a book about memory and memorization (Una Mente Prodigiosa by Ramón
Campayo), originally written in spanish (I´m a native spanish speaker), which
gave me a lot of insights and tools for memorizing better, but I never applied
it to my learning process. This course has filled the gap between memorizing
and learning, the missing piece that I needed to complete the puzzle. The tools
mentioned in that book are also mentioned here, but joined together with the
process of learning subjects completely, with understanding, creativity,
flexibility, associations and long term memorization.I have used the
tools given in this course to learn and memorize the course itself, and they
have been truly effective. I have also used them in studying in my own area of
work, which is mechanical engineering, and also have proven to be quite useful.
I now feel that the information stay in my mind for longer, which helps to
understand new and more complex concepts better. Of course, memorizing is not
learning, real learning comprises a lot of other things, but it´s a very
important part of the learning process. If you can´t remember the material,
then you can´t use the information to solve anything, to learn new things or to
use the information creatively. I also play the
piano, and I have even used some of the information while practicing and
learning new songs. This demonstrates that the concepts of the course can be
used in any field, as long as you´re learning something.Another
important and pleasant aspect of this course, is the way Dr. Barbara Oakley
presents the material. She is so kind and friendly, which gives you the
sensation that you are listening to a close friend or someone that you´ve known
for a long time. That makes the course material more accessible and enjoyable.
Dr. Terry Sejnowski also does a very good job at teaching. They´re just so easy
to hear. The material is very clear and well organized.I will say like
Dr. Barbara says very often: I can´t thank you both enough for this course. I´m
really grateful. Learning is a lifelong process, and that´s where the
importance of this course lies.
I thought this was an absolutely great course and I am so glad I took it. For me, multiple choice tests, problem sets and expository rather than analytic term papers were the norm. These examination procedures are relatively objective ways to evaluate learning. In addition, as US students, we were sometimes also expected to make oral presentations. By the way, the oral presentations of Oakley and Sejnowski were superb. When I asked my English students to come to class with an oral presentation, they addressed whatever objections or fears that they may have had, by not coming class on the day given -  they knew their grade was based solely on one essay written at home and one essay written under exam conditions. Anyway, from having studied and taught in England, my experience has been that multiple choice tests are derided, and hardly used at all for more advanced students. Being able to write an essay about something is valued or evaluated. I have taught courses where there was an essay for the exam and an essay for the term project, and that was it.  To me, essays are certainly useful, and I wish that I was better at writing them myself. The drawbacks are at least two. 1) Valuing essays alone tends to favor those who can make something sound good rather than those who might have a superior understanding of a subject. This has a less than salutary effect on political discourse, among other things, not that we are doing better in the US at the moment. It favours those who sound clever rather than those who actually are clever. 2) It means that students can sometimes strategize - they may know they only have to answer 2 essay questions about two subjects out of  five subjects for example, so they may not bother to learn 3/5 of the material, and there is no way to tell whether they have as much knowledge about the other subjects as about the one they wrote about in their essay."The Learning How to Learn" Coursera course would help any student to understand the material that they would have to write about either quickly or in a more considered way, but it leaves out the whole question (nearly) of how to get better at writing about what you have learned. This is not exactly a criticism of the course. You are likely to have heard of this tendency to value essay writing above all else in the British system. That "Learning" means different things in different places is hardly an earth-shaking conclusion but I thought I would mention it.Thank you very much for the course. It was completely fantastic and I am so glad that a friend recommended it to me.
This is a great course.  The concepts and techniques taught here should be required by every teacher and student in our school systems from kindergarten on.  Of course, some of the material is well beyond the grasp of a kindergartner, but the techniques and methods can be taught by how their teacher manages the delivery of curriculum.   It is never too early to teach our children how to learn.This is a wonderfully succinct presentation of key concepts that I wish had been available to me in my youth.   I was very fortunate to have an anatomy and physiology professor in college in 1979 that took time in his lectures to teach about how the brain learns and some methods and principles for study, retention, and recall.   I saw many of his concepts in this course.I later went on to teach college myself.   I found the students in my Freshman course on data communications were particularly lazy about making an effort to learn material thoroughly.   I knew this bad habit would hinder their progress in the semesters to come.I adopted a practice of making my mid-term exam a thorough (not to be confused with level of difficulty) test of their understanding.  Consequently, 60% would fail that test.   When delivering the bad news I also delivered a path to recovering from that score.   I provide several hours of lecture on what I learned about learning from my A&P professor.   Then I offered a retest.   The questions were posed differently in wording and type (multiple choice vs short answer essay vs T/F).  Everyone improved their score significantly and the pass/fail distribution reflected more of a bell curve distribution.Interestingly, when I tried teach how to learn before the mid-term I still saw a 60% failure rates.   I expect somethings require more motivation.   The risk of failing a course proved to be motivating, so I capitalized on that human behavior.   I wish I could have found a better way, because this approach cost several lecture hours of data communications instruction.   However, teaching them to learn proved so much more valuable.I, unexpectedly had the same high failure rate on a term test teach an Algebra class.   I responded in kind with lectures on how to learn.   On student that started with failing the first term test almost dropped.   Another student that had taken other classes encouraged her stay on and to learn how to learn.   She finish Algebra with an A-.   At the end of the course she came to me with the most treasured compliment of my teach career, "You taught me that I can learn anything I want to learn."
Hello!“Learning how to learn” at first might seem quite absurd.But I assure you that this would be by far the most quintessential course you have ever taken.The course itself is taken by Terry Sejnowski (Professor at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies) and Barbara Oakley, (Ph.D., PE is a Professor of Engineering at Oakland University.)Where she explains, How by considering herself as the “belligerent queen in math” she flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation.But it was when she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options :Both to rise in the military and to explore other careers.She returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.In “Learning how to learn”, Dr. Oakley and Terry Sejnowski lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science ( or any field in particular) secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. In the course many important topics likeProcrastination, Chunking, the difference between Long-term and short-term memory and Focused and diffused modes are taken up and discussed in depths (step by step).Moreover many small topics like Test taking, Teamwork, Spaced repetition and Memory retention techniques (including memory palace, usage of analogy and visual representation) are also included which is quite unconventional but extremely helpful especially for students and learners learning a new language.Plus the small Finger exercises and Peer-graded Assignments with a grading percentage criteria always helps students to strive for the “best. Hence, whether by introducing the idea of Zombie mode and other sophisticated processes like Einstellung, Deliberate practice and Transfer idea all by taking examples of great personalities like : Thomas Edison, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and, Salvador Dali, or by providing optional interviews and redings from one of the renowned scholars : Dr. Robert Bilder, Keith Devlin, Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent never failed to enthuse our interest in a particular topic and always encouraged us to achieve our highest creative potential.Thank you !

Capabilities to Learn is My Biggest MotivationBefore starting this MOOC, I was very nervous and anxious
about the materials I needed, the type of information I will learn, and how
successful I’d be at completing this course. There was also some skepticism on
whether or not this course would actually teach me anything useful in my
journey for higher education. It took me a week to commence studies, but I
quickly became engaged after introductions from Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.
Terrence Sejnowski. I believe it was their own nervousness that gave me comfort
in the beginning, and then watching them transform with a higher sense of
confidence allowed me to trust their discourse.After the first two weeks, I had the opportunity to speak
creatively during Sunday dinners with family on some of the scientific factors
involved with Learn2Learn. I was surprised at how much of the information I was
able to recall and how it led to us reminiscing about past experiences we
thought were long forgotten. I’ve definitely changed my perspective or thought
process on a lot of events, circumstances, and choices discussed with family,
which leads me to have a better understanding of Dr. Sejnowski’s lecture on
memory consolidation.Now that my confidence level has experienced a significant
boost, it motivated me to take on a second MOOC. This could not be possible
without the information I’ve obtained from “Learning How to Learn.” I had given
up on myself and didn’t think I was mentally ready or capable of successfully
completing college-level course work. I was wrong! After applying several of
the techniques captured from this course, I am motivated to move forward with
my educational goals, and will only look back to remember the skills I
developed from this MOOC. Thank You Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for your inspiration.
This course is like one of those nostalgic memories, which
force us to desire foresight. Generally speaking though the course is helpful
for everybody, but it will be a boon for many students. Many techniques and
scenarios discussed in the course will definitely help both during learning
phase and also during revision as well as in tests. The course rightly points out many blunders that students
commit due to bad habits acquired through students life. The bad habits I am
talking about is about learning only and not of ethical values!! For e.g.
practicing easy questions enough or first thing and not focusing on hard
questions and many more like them. So for me the course has:PROS:1. A very short duration of course.2. Easy teaching style of Prof. Oakely combined with
relevant examples. 3. Synthesis of various learning techniques, so that week by
week students gain a better understating of learning process.4. Easy and simple steps to follow to see improvement.5. Interviews with relevant figures to give a flavor
different and at the same time similar thinking process across the successful.6. The course is free. CONS:1. The second instructor Dr. Sejnowski is very knowledgeable
and have a firm grasp of the material, but the things that he taught could be
trimmed by 60% easily and it still will not take away anything relevant from
the course. Dr. Sejnowski also didn’t feel comfortable talking or explaining in
the front of the camera so his videos appeared to be forced.2. Most of the quiz question were taken verbatim from the
transcript. As this course is about creativity that part could have been
avoided to inculcate depper understanding of the subject. But in the end, I profited handsomely from this course. Thank you Prof. B. Oakley, Dr T Sejnowski and their entire team.
Me being very grateful to the Coursera and the Learning How to Learn (and another Coursera Course, somewhat similar to this one) Community. + sharing some works that I personally loved and which were brought to my mind by this particular course. I have been introduced to the world of wonderful opportunities to gain knowledge for free and in as comfortable environment as possible qute recently by a lovely russian-speaking YouTuber- Anastacia Kay (a link to her video on courseral:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGR5yJn-GZo) and I`ve been learning here ever since. Thanks to Nastya and Coursera! And to his particular course, which has made me a much better student, I believe. For now I know why I couldnot remember things well, though I`ve spent a lot of time studying. =) And now I have a deeper understandying of some of my earlier experiences (for instance, I`ve read a fictional book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child 'the reliquary' (detective-story & horrors -lovers might like it) and the main character used such a mental technique as 'Mental Palace'. I now know hot to use it too). + Some ideas from a great book (though its author could have argued with me on the title 'great' I gave and will continue giving it) "How to read a book" by Mortimer Adler, the ideas from the book and the course also matched and explained one another. Plus I would say, that this course workes best together with another insightful Coursera course "Neurobiology of everyday life". They provide a look on somewhat the same topics, giving different perspectives to it! All in all, I am really greateful to the creators of the course and the site! You help people learn about the world arround us with wonder and without limitations (financial, locational, health...)! Thank you!
Against popular opinion, learning is an art that is learned with guidelines the same way we learn various skills such as programming, driving, tailoring. Learning is one of the most complex phenomena considering the fact that everything else that is learned consciously or unconsciously is hinged on it. When I stumbled on the concept of “learning how to learn” on Cousera, I was more than excited to delve into it and see what it was all about. Indeed, the content 
in the course has so far surpassed my expectations. Learning isn’t always fun, sometimes while learning you get stuck on ideas that you cannot seem to figure out. However, through persistence and observing simple learning rules it becomes worthwhile.A very big thank you to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for this amazing, explicit, detailed yet concise course. I have learned so much from you. A lot of concepts have become clearer and my passion for learning in another dimension has been ignited.Having listened to Benny Lewis on the subject of leaning languages in his interview with Barbara Oakley during the course of this lesson, my passion was re-ignited. He opined that the best way to learn a language is to speak without the fear of making mistakes, this is because paying so much attention to mistakes will inhibit the learning process and might dampen the learner’s interest. I have resolved that no matter what it takes, sooner than I had expected, I would begin to speak the Spanish, the language of  dreams fluently.I would like to use this opportunity to reach out to anyone reading this who are bilingual in English and Spanish to help a friend. I want to speak it more often. It would be nice to Speak Español with you🤗.I can be reached on igenozanic@yahoo.comNicholas Igenoza.
I have just finished this course, and I must say that curiosity led me to take the course. 'Learning how to learn... ' I said to myself how do you learn to learn? Having finished the course, I totally agree that everyone needs to 'learn how to learn' If it can be simplified for the young minds, the course should actually be taken in grade school, then I thinks a lot more students will make straight A's. (Just my thought),

The saying goes 'who feel it knows it.' The experience and knowledge of the instructor's Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski coupled with the outline, presentation and video helps (if I may use the language of the course) in interleaving seemingly related and different ideas (using metaphors and analogies) through out this course.

How many things we take for granted? - movements, seeing, hearing, even blinking etc. The enigmatic power of the brain to process so many details within minutes, the power of your thoughts to change your person. Concept mapping, chunking, Procrastination and the Pomodoro technique (this I think we all do without realising there is actually techniques it, cues to procrastination etc.

There is just so much to learn in this short course than can be explained.

I am one of those who used the opportunity of the lock-down, it has opened my eye and I am willing to take more courses. I have also introduced the course to some people young and old to recharge their Brains.

It is difference from what I learnt in all my years through school, university and experience in life.

'The taste is in the pudding' My curiosity is thoroughly satisfied,

I deeply appreciate the instructors, Coursera and all the team members involved in making this course available online, Thank you
(+) Manageable bite-sized online lectures with interesting content that are highly relevant to the topic of Learning How to Learn(+) Assessments are pitched at the right level, with questions requiring recall of the concepts learnt and some other comprehension- and application-typed questions that require a bit more thinking to apply the concepts learnt.(+) Professor Oakley has a very interesting style of presenting the topic that makes the material very easy to digest and learn. She communicates key learning points in a concise and succinct manner using a variation of simple analogies, wacky (but meaningful) graphics, life stories and other examples to draw out or to associate to important lesson takeaways.(+) Personally, I did not managed to finish all the optional interviews but I really appreciate the time and effort used to glean additional inputs and insights from multiple perspectives and I hope to be able to revisit this course at a later time.(+) Professor Sejnowski's insights into learning how our brain works is something new to me. It is also an important part of this course. Although I could barely recall the terminologies, but certain images that he has shared to assist in scientific explanations, and the true accounts of HM as well as the two scientists who swollowed poison without being poisoned, did stay in me and helped me understand the material better.Thank you, Professor Oakley and Sejnowski, the course was meaningful and well-paced, offering insights into learning and how the brain works. I greatly appreciate the effort and time spent to make the materials and information illustrative for learners.
This course, the professionalism of the teaching staff and the content impressed me to the extent I sent emails to every thinking person I know.  One of my students has done weeks one and two several times.... she is a grade 11 school student and an original thinker.  She is the only one that looked at the course and gave me feed back.      I am so grateful to be able to learn from great thinkers without feeling that I am one of the world's failures.  How very much I do appreciate not being talked down to and being given the time to write down words that I might not know well and, finding that as I learn meanings from an ordinary dictionary, I am able to use those words on a day to day basis.  I am also so grateful that I did not have to buy anything either from the University or from needing extra books to understand the course.
     I have changed several of my home tutoring practices.  In fact as it is school holidays here I have been practicing to 'teach' as well as the teachers on this course. 
    My nature is such that I need to thank people for the service they do to others.  I wish I could thank you by buying a million certificates. As I am unable to do this or even buy one - what I can do is acknowledge that I learned what I know from the University of California, San Diego and mention  the names of those who helped me learn.  The other way of saying thank you is to remind my thinking friends that if they wish to avoid loss of their abilities to think rationally, as they age ,  they could look at the courses available to everyone.

I loved this course!  The material was presented in a clear, easy-to-remember fashion, with lots of memory devices to help remember (whodathunkit?) the material, not just the usual powerpoint slides.  The quiz after every video was low-stakes and I appreciated knowing up front that each quiz can be tried again, with the highest score kept.  This made it low-stakes and less stressful, and made me more likely to complete it on time.  The professors were cheerful and upbeat and made class a pleasure.  The material is all solidly researched, and I loved the optional interviews and extra reading material.  Much of the course information tied in with things I'd already read, like telling yourself a racing heart means you're excited, not afraid (I read that in The Upside of Stress, by Kelly McGonigle).  But even the things I knew or had tried were presented in a new context, in such a way I'm more likely to remember them in the future.  Great job!  One piece of constructive criticism:  the demeanor of both professors on camera is wooden.  I expect they're both *much* better lecturing in person.  I know from experience that you can vastly improve your performance on camera with practice and some mental tricks---like having someone watch you just beyond the camera and lecturing to them, not the camera.  As this didn't cause functional problems with the course, I'd still rate the course at 99% . :) . The stiffness of the interviewing could also be improved, but rest assured, I LOVED the class and would definitely take a class from Dr. Oakley again.  I've bought her book and look forward to reading it.
I just would like to express my gratitude in completing my online course  Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to master tough subjects with the helped of our Professors  Barbara Oakley and Terry  Sejnowski on their willingness to discuss each topic for us to fully understand and providing tips on how to use more effectively every techniques and mental tools in our daily life. By taking this course I learned how to set things in order, managing my time in doing my task by not delaying or not procrastinate to accomplish it.  Still fresh on my mind those techniques that have been discussed in a video like the Promodoro techniques, the Focused and Diffuse mode, the importance of memory and how to work it properly, The value of teamwork, and making a  checklist in day to day task to use it to positively in doing things to accomplish and a lot more to mention.  I can not be proud of myself self unlike before I  have not started my online course I  always confused and overthinking what to do first and what to do next. Now,  I am very confident to go to the next level and do my work effectively by applying those techniques that I have learned in this course. Once again, Thanks so much to the creator and the Management of Coursera, Instructors, most especially to our company that gives this opportunity which all for free and the people behind all of these to helps millions of people to finish their degrees online that is more convenient for them complete without quitting ourJob or going outside to go to school because it can be done even just by a stay at home. More Power!
Truly incredible course. It was rewarding experience to learn how our brain works. It opens many doors in our life when we know how our brain works, at least we can understand why we have certain kind of feeling. As sometimes we can't understand why we have feeling of discomfort, but it is the brain's signal coming from the subconcious that you have messed up something and now you have to look up where you've goofed up and make it correct. What I have learned is that pain is incredibly powerful tool created by nature. I mean how can know if something bad happened to you if there's no pain(both physical and mental). It's a nature's way of grabing your attention to address that problem so now and next time you be careful and not repeat that mistake. Pain, anger and frustration are really powerful feelings that can do wonders in our life if you acknowledge their existence. It is the path towards the truth. Just like in one of the optional interview we've seen the pain of his grandmother's death due to Alzheimer motivated Nelson Dellis to become memory champion. This course is also helpful for the people who are dealing with Depression, Social Anxiety, PTSD, chronic fear and much more because when they are dealing with those problems it creates a lots of confusion as to why they have certain kind of feeling.Internet is such an incredibly powerful tool if it is used smartly. I can't believe we have access to such a high quality material for free. Thank you Barbara Oakley ma'am, Terry Sejnowski sir, Coursera team and all the people who are associated with this course.
-- From an introvert( who has completed his first-ever MOOC course :)I have always been one of those people who could never quite excel in my academics. Seeing my classmates outsmarting me in every subject had always left me wondering if I wasn't intelligent enough to grasp the concepts like others. Such things can affect you in a lot of ways for a very long period. Two of the things that affected me the most are my self-confidence and my losing interest in subjects that I really loved once upon a time. Apart from the priceless lesson that this course provides, it also helped me with those two most affected parts of my life. About this course, at first, a massive thank you to the loving instructors of this course Miss Barb Oakley and Mr.Terry Sejnowski. Like I mentioned that this is the first MOOC course that I have ever completed, I believe that it was only possible because of the passion, dedication, and care that you show about the students in every lesson of this course. I can't remember the last time when I enjoyed learning something this much as a student. Throughout the course, I could feel a sense of security and learn purely without having to compare myself with others. Even though it is an online course you both made me feel as you have got my back. So, ya thank you again for making learning enjoyable again and most importantly for bringing back the faith in me that I can be a master at anything if I firmly believe in it and by using the precious wisdom that this course has provided me with.
Taking the Learning How to Learn class was one of the best decisions I've made in the past ten years regarding maintaining my skills current and relevant to my professional life in high tech. I used to fall prey to a sense of being perennially "behind" regarding the amount of technical knowledge I need to master for my work. Since my University days, my modus operandi used to be: repetition and brute force, i.e., more or less, cramming.After this class, I now have a set of tools I can actually relate to.  I can use them proficiently to learn smarter, retain information better, and foremost, understand what my particular "cues' are if procrastination gets in my way again. I cannot thank Drs Oakley and Sejnowski enough for the deliberate pace of this course: they carefully pared down its content, with luminously clear explanations often delivered with a down-to-earth approach sprinkled with humor. I sincerely hope that this small message of gratitude will encourage whomever is "on the fence" to register for the course. By the way, by requesting a Certificate of Completion, I felt that I had"skin in the game,"I had a deadline to honor.  Whether tired, or pressed for time, knowing that I had paid the modest sum for my Certificate encouraged me to make time for myself to go through each lesson carefully and learn the special vocabulary associated with these new tools. Very best wishes to all, you will be so happy you took the time to go through the class!Sincerely,Catherine von DennefeldNapa, CA
I’m really thankful to Barb & Terry for the course! If you like me spending too much time for videos and reading
loads of articles about productivity you might have kinda mess in the head
about putting all the information in the right order. There are so many of them
and you are, reasonably, could get lost in it! Lucky me, I’ve tried the course and now, finally, the general
picture of how to be more productive become clearer to me.Here are some main reasons why you need to try the course
(whatever you feeling confident in learning or not):1. First of all, it is all about how closely
connected neuroscience and learning (+other life aspects) – everything has
scientific proof of why is it reasonable to act this way not the other one. And
yet it’s not a dogma (because loads of things we need to discover so far), but the
ideas and techniques which were presented in the course are really reasonable
and perspective.2. The second important reason why it is a great
idea to enroll the course – is about concepts and ideas of how to deal with
procrastination – the boss-devil of nowadays, I might say.3. Also I really enjoy the way of simplicity and
openness of how Barb presented every piece of information adding examples and
being funny (but concrete!) all the time.I’m not putting a big review in here but saying what I found
the most useful for me from the course. So try the course and share your own
thoughts about it! I’m sure you will not regret it :)Good luck to all and happy learning! :)

At the very beginning the course seemed somehow easy and pretty basic. Nonetheless, once that you start understanding the biological reason about how and why we learn, you get the feeling that this course will definitively change your life. And that is exactly what has happened to me. Before this course I had the illusion that what I was doing was normal, I mean the way in which I was accustomed to learn. However, I had that sense that something was wrong with my approach. It turns out that my intuition was right because I was completely wasting my time while rereading or highlighting the material all the time, just to give you an example. Additionally, I knew that procrastination could affect your life and your productivity in a way that you do not catch until you start getting anxious, for instance. Therefore a simple technique like the pomodoro, which I have been using during the last month, has been enormously beneficial for your studying and productivity.Furthermore, there are some techniques like the memory palace, or the use of metaphors and analogies that will definitively ease your job while learning any subject.Apart from that, understanding how your brain works and why you have certain behavior under certain circumstances, will change the way that you process any new information and it will boost your cognitive abilities up.Please, give it a try, then you will understand what I have written here.Learning how to learn, in my opinion, is a must, not an option.Happy journey.
If it was permitted, I would rate 10 Star for this
course,  I hail from India a country where we chant The auspicious mantra
recited an chanted on teacher’s day and Guru Purnima is  "Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara; Guru
Sakshat Param Brahma, Tasmai Shri Guravay Namah Guru is Brahma, who is the Lord of Creation, also called as
Generator, Guru Vishnu means Guru is Vishnu (Vishnu is the Lord who is called
organizer), Guru Devo Maheshwarah means Guru is the Maheshwara (Shiva or the
destroyer), Guru Sakshat Parabrahma means Parbrahma viz. the supreme god or
almighty. Since Guru leads to a path of light, Guru is that Para
Brahma. Tasmai Shree Guruve Namah means we bow to that Guru the guru referred
to earlier. I bow to my Guru's Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr.Terrence
Sejnowski for all their research and hard work in bringing us the effective
techniques of learning which can be applied for any forms of learnings
(Art,Science, Literature, Language, Higher studies). I recommend this course to all those who are trying to learn
new things but unable to progress.. I would use these techniques to teach others so the purpose
of this course serves (help others). I was very delighted  to see my native language Kannada
tongue twister being played  and interests of participants to learn Yoga,
Chakra Meditation which was originated from India.  Namasthe to my Guru's , Wish good luck for the learning aspirants, please go with
this course without any second thought.
Since the original book "A Mind for Numbers" written by Dr. Barbara Oakley came out some years ago alongside the other books and studies, if you have been highly interested in learning method you might see the ideas in this course whether via books or online like I did. In spite of the fact that there rarely was a totally new method I got to know, it was great to see all the brilliant ideas in one place with supportive references so I don't need to worry about false myths and unreasonable remedies.The lecture is about learning, and the best point of this lecture is that it is about not only 'study' itself but also things for a better study such as preventing procrastination and test-taking tips. Dr. Barbara also gives you some mindful advice for learning to help you not to be afraid of taking a new step and not to judge your own ability and give up too early and too easily. Personally, I do not like most of the self-help books which point out all the problem could be changed if you think differently. However, her lecture was a bit different since she actually helps you find a better perspective on your problem and let you know it is not only you who have the same problem and it is able to be solved.You could finish this course without paying option and there are honour contents that will give you further understanding and extra recognition for the course. There is no doubt that by having this course I would be better prepared for my further study.

GREAT COURSE:

Are you a passionate learner but sometimes feel that you could do better
 with your learning? Well, this course could do magic for you. I have 
loved every bit of the course from the moment I signed up. It has given 
me an opportunity on reflect on my learning and the effectiveness of the
 methods I use. The course takes a deep look into how the brain works 
and how we can make our brains better because brains are the part of the
 body responsible for our learning. The facilitators especially Terry 
made me feel like I have studied the brain for loving. Barbara keeps on 
provide valuable techniques for learning which i surely wouldn't have 
known if I didn't take this course. Thanks for those tips. 

As a result of this course, I am sure that my learning and study time is
 going to be more enjoyable and I hope to improve my grades in my 
masters study because the techniques and tips from here can not leave 
you the same. Same of bad habits like procrastination and last minute 
study we tackled and ideas to overcome them provided. Who am I to remain
 the same?

I am truly grateful to God that I found this course. A big thank you to 
the facilitators once again and Coursera for this Knowledge. 

I highly recommend anyone looking to improve their learning methods to 
start with this course if he/she has not done it. If you are indeed 
passionate about learning, this course could do all the Magics for you.

Thank you
I can't even begin to describe how helpful this course was for me. In school, I thought I had a learning disability. My reading comprehension was poor, my memory was not that great. I had terrible study habits.I didn't do that great at tests...What this course has helped me conclude is that, I just didn't know how to learn very well. In fact, I don't think schools teach this enough to students when they are learning to form their "very first chunks". Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski have broken down the learning process and have explained it in a very simple way, using a ton of visual examples, (which by the way is a great way to retain information) and have given me a deeper understanding of using creative learning techniques to simply learning better.They are also very passionate and excited about teaching and that makes a huge difference. They are wonderful instructors and enjoy what they do. It shows in their lectures and course material. Their videos are funny and it just made everything so much more enjoyable. My biggest take away from this course is that you can use science to explain how something works, but learning - that's where it becomes personal. It is a journey that is special to you, that is unique to you and only you. And if you know how to do it better, you're rewarding yourself, and you will enjoy everything you do and learn much better moving forward in your life.Take this class.  I loved it!
5 stars and kudos to Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for a job well done.  I've enjoyed the course and completed the 4 weeks in 1 week.  Also enjoyed reading and watching the optional videos and articles.  The stories and concepts are inspiring.  It goes to show anyone can learn if given the right techniques to learn and if the person is motivated and commited.  We are home during this covid-19 pandemic so it's been tough juggling computer time to do things but I managed to do so and if I can do it, so can you.  I did at night and early morning to give everyone a chance and when the family was taking a break for lunch, I grabbed the laptop to do optional readings and videos.  The quizzes were fine and the final test was good.  I enjoyed doing the week 3 project.  I haven't received a grade on the project but I did grade and provided feedback to my peers who completed the projects.  I took the oneline course at coursera for free so I did not pay for it nor have a certification for it.  I did get 100's and 89's on the quizzes and tests and on the final got a 92%.  My point is if you plan to further yourself, it's a good idea to take this course with the expectation that you are paying for it and the professors expect only your best performance.  It's your future and your life, learning how to learn will change some things in you.  Best wishes and thank you to my two professors - it was a pleasure!  -Miguel
This is an excellent course on learning how to learn.  The videos are engaging and lively, and the instructors have an interest in the subject that rubs off on you.  Dr. Oakley in particular manages to teach the material in a vibrant and lively way, although such things are a bit subjective so you may or may not appreciate her style as much as I did.  Dr. Sejnowski, while clearly engaged and inspiring, seemed uncomfortable and at times a bit stuttering in front of the camera.  On the other hand, I am in the second week of the companion course “Mindshift” now, and he is much more comfortable there.One of the important points in this course is active learning.  The team behind the course have eaten their own dogfood by providing a lot of quizzes, polls, and pauses for freestyle reflection (text-boxes) for the student to test their knowledge of the material, as well as reflect on it.  The “honors” assignments provide even more opportunities for learners to reflect and consolidate their knowledge.All videos are well-cited, and each module has a healthy dose of optional readings, as well as optional videos.  On the whole I feel that this optional material has given me good pointers for further self-study, as well as helping me to relate what I've learned in this course with other resources that are unaffiliated with this course.Disclaimer: This is only the first course I've finished on Coursera.
I am not sure if the course will help me in any degree but that is solely due to my laziness, low self-esteem and year long struggle with depression. However, with regards to the course itself, I think it can be very usefull. A lot of the learing tips seem common sense but for me it was very important that all of them were supported by science , not only the kind of advice that any person could give you. I can only regeret that I did not take a similar course when at school or at the universtiy. I am sure I will use, or at least try to use, some of the techniques and do more reading on the subject (using both the Web and the publications mentioned throughout the course of the lectures). In my opinion, the fact that the lectures are divided into rather short segments is beneficial as it helps to go through the course even without having much time and incresaes motivation to continue, as one is not faced with having to listen for a lecture for an hour or so. I often found myself only plannig to view one short videos and ending up in wieving a couple one after another, not noticing how much time passed. Finally, I think that both of the lecturers are a great benefit of the course as they bring a lot of enthusiasm and good will and seemed people I would like to know in person (or at least that was my impression). Greetings and thanks from Poland to both of them!
I took this class before beginning completion of a formal bachelors degree at an online university. It’s been 13 years since I went to college and quit, and since it’s so much more expensive now than it was, I wanted to make sure my more mature and rusty brain would get the most out of it.I’m really, really glad I did! I feel more confident that I’ll be able to handle the workload when spring semester starts. Not only that, but I’ve learned quite a few good techniques to handle issues in daily life as well. I also recently received an ADD diagnosis, and these techniques are already helping me learn how to use my brain better.The most impactful is her discussion on process vs product with procrastination, and the pomodoro technique. A lot of advice that I’ve previously read said to focus on a task until it is done, no matter how long it takes; which never really worked for me, and now I know it’s because my brain is not wired for long focus on something I’m not deeply interested in. Using the pomodoro and process focus techniques, I can muster up 25 minutes of solid focus, while not letting the anxiety of getting it completed distract me for that time.I would recommend this course to everyone. Let’s face it, most of us probably aren’t using our brains that well, and this course gives some great insights on how brains work, and how to use them better.
I graduated from college 5 years ago and have been looking to get back into the swing of taking courses and studying to further my education, both for my career and leisure. But it's been a daunting prospect because it's been so long and I'm not in a regimented program (I work full time, so school is no longer the only thing in my life). My brother introduced me to Professor Barbara Oakley's work and suggested I take this MOOC as a "warm up", if you will, to not only help get me back into "student mode", but also gain a better understanding of how the process of learning works. I have to say, this course was well worth it! I learned a lot of valuable information, and the course has helped with some of my habits - I find myself recalling concepts like "chunking" and "Einstulling" in everyday life - and I plan on reading the optional material now that I've finished the course. The optional videos are also worth watching and help reinforce the ideas being taught in the primary lessons. I have to say that it wasn't easy taking this course - by Week 3 and 4 real life started creeping in and I found it difficult to keep to the schedule I had set for myself to "focus" on the material. But I dealt with it head on. The entire experience online and offline was worthwhile because this is how things are going to be for future courses I take.
This was a fantastic course. The course was in small chunks, therefore, I found it easy to complete the weekly modules without it taking up much of my day or week.I appreciated the mini-tests after the majority of the videos as this would help me gauge my understanding of that particular video.Having tests at the end of the week also was helpful to my learning.The interweaving of information also helped me recall information from previous weeks.Great tips, techniques, advice on how to be a better learner - practical tips. So just doing the course and NOT enacting the advice won't be of much use to you, however, practice the techniques over a period of time IS.It's stuff even as someone who has completed her bachelor degree believes anyone can find this useful. I actually also was able to relate some of the things I've learned on this course to how I would answer interview questions.The pace was consistent.The content was manageable.The structure was well put together.It's free. With options to pay, so if you don't feel like you benefited from this course (I doubt it) you haven't wasted your money.I can not say enough positive things about this course.CONS:Taking so long to find this course. Wish I was able to find this course BEFORE I started my undergraduate degree. But I can not in all honesty fault this course.
I have learned a lot during the course. The process led me into a better understanding of what I have already known, besides strengthening other aspects of learning which I had not focused much. For me, the key ideas were crucial and I can now say that I learned how to learn! The course was a very beneficial one due to the importance of the material, the great lecturers and the practical methods that can be used frequently.Here are some of the key methods:-To-do list-Distinguish between the focus mode and the diffuse mode, when to use them and what their advantages-Learn effectively different subjects using a focused small period of time and taking sportives breaks so you can enter the diffuse mode and fresh your thinking -get a better understanding of the memory, learning how to chunk an idea or method and learning material with a positive feeling and fun using metaphors.-recall, memory palace, deliberate learning, outline ideasI want to thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley for the great teaching and also to Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for the deep information and meaningful stories.Last but not least.I think you should try it! You can not know when you will need to use this material, and more correct after taking this course you can not know when not to use it!////////////////////////Author: Itay Barok.
For anyone of almost any age (there is an associated book on Learning How to Learn for Kids and Teens) I would and could not recommend this course strongly enough.It takes a basic level of effort to go through each week and complete watching the videos and doing the accompanying quizzes.The advice Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski give is concise, interesting and practical and simple to apply for anyone.I think this is the sort of material that should be taught at schools and emphasised.Since a lot of the focus at school is concentrating on WHAT you learn but it seems the all important HOW is barely addressed though I hope with courses and information like this that will change in time for a better balance.When you think about it seems so logical and obvious that this should be taught in schools.I think if I had been taught these key concepts when I was in school things would have turned out much different but also now with this knowledge it still can turn out different.Again I highly recommend taking this course to enlighten yourself and better prepare for your next test or course of study be it personal or professional. You will without a doubt get much more out of your future studies.All the very best of success to you.Remember " Fortune Favours the Bold! "
Learning How to Learn has rekindled my passion of teaching
and preparing students for tests. As a teacher of Academic English and Test
Preparation, motivating students and understanding which methods would work
better for them have been quite a struggle. Thanks to this course, I now have
more knowledge to share with my learners and also to apply in my own learning
path. This course starts with an explanation of the human brain
and thinking patterns, without boring you, yet including the nitty-gritty of
the foundations of learning. The analogies used in the videos and by the
wonderful teachers in this course have helped me understand complex brain
processes in a simplified, comprehensible manner. The videos include the physiology of the brain and the
relevance of sleeping and exercise in forming new learning opportunities for
our brain. There are also tons of tips and suggestions in preparing for tests,
acquiring new knowledge and retaining information. As the teachers explain,
especially Ms. Barb Oakley, thinking you only have certain strengths and
weaknesses leads you to thinking that way and not taking any measures to learn
what you are not good at – which should be quite the opposite. The teachers
guide you step by step through the ideal learning process.
This is an empowering course that helps you to think you too can get better at learning and mastering complex topics. Think that schools should have this course at the beginning of their curriculum at different stages - kindergarden, primary school, high school, college and other studies. In each new stage you should revise these concepts, to make sure you are always on the right track to effective learning.The quality of some videos and interviews could be improved (some interviews end with an abrupt cut and subjects seem to be rambling in some parts). Gave it the highest rate because of the novelty and usefulness of content but think it can be improved in those aspects. The course helps to overcome the insecurity that arises when going to uncharted territory and to motivate you to learn things that you don't feel naturally talented to learn (favoring a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset) and so I think it is a fundamental tool in times where continuous learning is key. Keep up the good work!PS: really liked the interviews with the computer science and language learning hackers (so motivating to see that people can have that sort of motivation and discipline to learn on their own, and bring to light resources that are in most part available to everyone)
First thing first, Dr. Barbara Oakley is a good teacher, and trust me when I say you won't regret taking this course. Her poise, pace and voice is unique and very effective. My sincerest thanks to her and the team who has put together is course after extensive research and CHUNKING it for us. I wish I could access to this in my high school days. But, its never late!I have been trying to learn a lot of things that interests me; but never have continuity and able to finish them (if not mastering). This insightful course has taught me why and will help me see learning in a different perspective by debunking. Concepts of Chunking, Illusion of Competence, Recall & reward, diffused and focussed modes, zombies, metaphors & analogy etc., not only helps you learn but practicing them often with yourself and teaching them to others will be rewarding. The best outcome however I want to take from this course is stopping my procastination while multitasking is required.For learners - watch out for the additional interviews after every week's main content. A request, don't practice your randomness on this course, it is structured to give best results. If possible, let your kids take this course.Thank you Dr. Oakley and the team; and happy teaching more.Vipin Krishnan
I had a discussion with a friend on how I chose the course as she's confused between the variety of courses out there. Here's what I said. 


Reasons that I like the course:
: 1- It is quite practical and useful, very applicable in all sorts of areas. 2- Ir presents new information (and I'm not a stranger to the field) and evidence/sources. 3- It gives examples and demonstrations (esp. visual) to help clarify the concepts 4- Mixes between the personal aspect of having an instructor and the value/engagement  of  displaying images and such from the web.

Reasons that I chose the course to begin with:
The topic itself is very important, especially because it can optimize all your work (make it exponential, ya3ni if you learn faster by 2X for example, you'd have a very positive impact in your professional development and such). I was searching for the topic "learning how to learn" and this was one of the few courses with this title. Plus, the credibility of the instructors (e.g. Mcamaster university) and the fact that it has discussion forums   

Weakness: 
 I have to say that their visual/audio effects are quite lame and it's a  bit  crude مشرتح but I don't care much for the aesthetic sides of things so it suits me well. The content is great.
Its ranking as the best course on MOOC is highly deserved! They really delivered on bringing visual aids and metaphors to the concept they were teaching - walking the walk, as well as talking the talk. As a perpetual student and an aspiring professor one-day, I really appreciated this amazing course that Barbara and Terrence have put together. I am taking away many practical lessons from this class: how to engage my diffuse mode thinking (Dali!), importance of flushing out metabolic brain toxin by sleeping, and how to keep away memory vampires by practice! Not to mention, I actually went and learned how to make animated video for the final assignment - something that I have been thinking for a while and kept putting away. This course finally provided the push and the confidence to start that project, and not only that, but I am now re-evaluating all the areas of learning that I pushed away thinking that I was simply better at other things - learning foreign languages or material science. Now I am off to find MOOCs in those areas with the knowledge that it will be worth my time and effort to learn them - even if I am not "naturally gifted" in them. All the love and best wishes for Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence from Mongolia!
Really useful course. It helps me review my works and study.I come from Taiwan, currently as a MBA student studying in the UK. As a non English native speaker, it is really stressful to learn new things in academic level in a foreign language. I used to force myself study for a very long time without a break, but the results were not good as I expected. I blamed this to my language barrier, I thought the difference between the other successful peers is I couldn't have an the chance as the others who had better educational environment and leant English on the early stage.This class lets me understand the biggest challenge of my learning is procrastination. Hopefully, procrastination is nothing about being stupid or should feel shame about, it is a natural metal mechanism of our brain avoiding unpleasure things. And it can be overcome by methods and practices. Pomodoro Technique really helps my memory and extends the time I keep concentrate on one thing. With the practice my brain works more efficient and it brings better result.I recommend this course for the other who is struling with the barrier on learning and who does not have confident for himself/ herself on working and leaning. This course may change your mind.
Hello:I'm Keith Grimes and I just completed your course. I really enjoyed the course and feel that I've learned quite a bit about learning. I enrolled in the course simply because I felt it was time to take my love of "the idea of learning" and turn it into "the practice of actually learning something."What I loved most about the course was Barbara Oakley herself and her inspiring story. I graduated from Oakland University with a bachelors degree in English. During those undergrad days, I often experienced the Impostor Syndrome. Discovering that there was an actual name for what I often felt, combined with the struggle to learn that Dr. Oakley experienced in her younger years, really connected with me. Thank you for sharing.One other note... I recently had the opportunity to share many of these ideas and concepts with my son who is a sophomore at Michigan State University. As Dr. Sejnowski mentioned in the final video, the measure of really knowing if you've learned something is to teach it to someone else. Sharing what I learned with my son in order to help him along his journey as a student, was an invaluable experience.Thanks again for offering this course.Keith D. Grimeshttps://www.linkedin.com/in/keithdgrimes
I loved it from the beginning till the end! It was perfectly structured (easily "chunkable":)), each video was really exciting and very easy to understand! I can only regret that I did not learn all of this back when I was studying at high school and the university. I'm sure I would have had more confidence and would have learned more deeply both several of the advanced mathematics subjects during my computer science studies at the university as well as in various other subjects earlier at school.Among all of the great ideas presented in the course I would like to highlight the idea that you have just four or so short term memory slots available to your focused thinking as something that I think would be very motivating for anyone not to give up complex subjects. In case you don't understand something all you have to do is grow chunks of the concepts (i.e. grow some neuron connections) involved using the focused and diffuse mode and give them some time to form.I have to get it translated to Latvian and popularize it here somehow. I think that could be one of the most efficient ways how to both increase the number of people who study the sciences as well as raise the average level of education at least a bit.
This course has opened my eyes to learning and provided me with a solid foundation to rebuild my own learning methods and strategies. I have gained tremendous insight about various forces at play that need to work like a well orchestrated symphony if I am to tackle complex subjects and master learning. The course is structured very well with short video lectures and sprinkled with quizzes to help you retain invaluable information. Also, there is opportunity for supplemental work to further cement one's newly discovered strengths. The optional reading sections and interviews with various people has further augmented my understanding and sparked ideas for novel applications of learning. By applying the techniques, I have already started to retain and recall more information than I have ever done before. I have also stopped wasting my time by re-reading material endlessly or writing things down. Instead after learning something new, I pause after each key idea and test myself if I can recall the gist of it and see how it fits with the rest of knowledge mass. This technique alone has unlocked my potential. I highly recommend this course to anybody. I am super excited for finding something that actually works.
One of
the most useful courses I took! Each of the modules provides unique tips to
overcome difficulties in learning, such as procrastination, taking exams and
revision, etc. I found that the short videos provided by Dr Oakley are very
convincing! You can read more as a reference list is provided at the end of the
video as well. The coverage of the material is also broad, I think everybody
can try to practice these techniques mentioned when they are studying as well. I also
appreciate the optional content embedded in the course as well. They include
interviews (one from professor Keith Devlin, the instructor of “Introduction to
Mathematical Thinking” as well!), and 2 further writing peer-reviewed
assignment. I think these contents are what made the course so good, it
provides you with a chance to produce a project (a poster, a presentation, or
even a song!) to showcase and summarize what you had learnt during the 4-week
course. During the production of the project, I feel like the values taught in
the class is more thoroughly embedded in my mind. Overall,
I highly recommend this course to people who struggle at learning sometimes
(just like me), I am sure you will learn a lot by watching the videos!
Superb. This is the first MOOC I managed to finish, and now I'm actively exploring all the extra resources and videos from the course.I originally enrolled looking for tips on how to make my courses more accessible for my students (I'm a college instructor), and also to help me hone my learning skills, since I'm starting to delve on different fields of study. Not only did I achieve those goals, but I'm also very excited to explore new MOOCs and online study possibilities.The only downside, if one could say such, is that this course sets quite a high bar in how a MOOC should be: one can easily percieve that everything about its format -- from the weekly newsletter to the videos' length and visuals to the structure and syllabus -- is made with careful consideration of the context of online learning, and of the fundamentals of neuroscience the course shares with the students. Many (good!) MOOCs aren't as well tailored as this one.I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested (even if frustrated!) with learning, be it independently, online or in a traditional classroom environment. Congratulations and warm thank yous to Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team!
This course is 4 weeks long;  Why Do something new for30 days; do this course.If you've always wanted t be a much better learner , then nows the time: think about it, you've always wanted to add to your learnings in life , advent you?   Invest in Meta learning - Learning about learning -  for the next 30 days. 30 days is  a great time span,  it's just about the right amount of time to add  this new habit , Learning how to learn, to your life.Get a hold of the coming month, (theres a course starting right now on 22 march2016), and  you can find instead of t 2016  flying by, forgotten, the time invested  in March/ April will make everything  in 2016 and beyond much more memorable.  Your self-confidence  as a Learner par excellence will  grow exponentially.!if you really want to be a superlative learner  badly enough, you can certainly  do  this course with dedication & commitment  for 30 days.When you make small,
sustainable changes, things you keep doing, they are more likely to
stick.So
here's my question to you: What
are you waiting for? the next 30 days are going to pass anyhow, so why not Choose  To be A  Skilful Learner, something you have always wanted to do and give it a shot!
I think this is one of the best courses I have attended. I wish concepts taught in this class are taught to every student right from the early age. I am 39 years old and as I look for a job (I was laid off a while back), I feel educating myself by getting certifications would be a good idea to enhance my prospects of exposing myself to better opportunities and with this course I have the self confidence that yes I can learn and get good grades in my certifications. I was getting bogged down by procrastination to a very large extent in my life and this course helped me deal with the procrastination zombies using pomodoro, this feels so empowering and I am glad I did not choose depression or bad habits. After incorporating the pomodoro technique I have also significantly reduced my 10+ year smoking habit and I am confident I will get rid of it like a champ. Listening to professors from such esteemed colleges and universities help break the dogma/belief in my head that people are born genius. With hard work, dedication and self-belief anything is possible. Lastly, I want to thank Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski from the bottom of my heart, Thank you for teaching me about learning.
After signing up for at least half a dozen (probably ~10) MOOCs over the past few years, this is the first course that I have actually followed to completion. Not only is the information relevant to my daily (non-student) life, but it is presented in an engaging and *cough* memorable way. I doubt I will be forgetting about my mental zombies or metabolic vampires anytime soon.The two most life changing, and I mean that literally, ideas shared in this course were the Pomodoro technique and focusing on "process", not "product". Using these two new methods/ideas I have made significant progress on projects I have been putting off for quite a while.All of the topics covered were engaging and informative, not to mention useful!For those who are hesitant to try this course due to lack of free time, I would recommend turning up the video speeds by 25% increments, until you are at a comfortable speed where you still understand the material, but compress your time spent watching the videos. I started at 1.25x, slowly working my way up to the max of 2x by the end of the course.This is an excellent course covering a critical topic that can improve your daily life, for the rest of your life!
I took this course as part of a programming curriculum, and I was 
absolutely hesitant to go through so much content. However, I have 
absolutely no regrets!

Be ready to learn a lot about learning, as ironic as that sounds!

You will learn some basic science behind the mind and how we learn, and 
then will be exposed to a lot of different methods you can use to learn 
whatever you need. 

The content creators are qualified due to their educational backgrounds 
and often times mention the studies that support their techniques. I 
truly believe that everybody would benefit from taking this course no 
matter where they are in life.

The first week of content absolutely blew me away, and made me realize 
that I was experiencing a lot of what was covered! I thought I didn't 
need this as I have been through K-12 and some college, but it 
definitely gave me a reality check.

I will admit that I was completely discouraged when I saw that estimated
 time completion. But I highly recommend setting your video speed to x2!
 I have tons of notes on my note editing software to accompany 
everything I've learned, and I will absolutely use what I've learned 
here for the rest of my life!
This course is helping me solve one of the most pressing problems I am facing as a student which is how to learn on my own in online courses. After searching books, talking with people, and searching the internet, I found this course. While I was aware of some of the material this course offered which aiding in my chunking of the material in this course, the mental techniques which I was not aware of have been very helpful such as chunking in small burst with the Pomodoro Technique and learning multiple subjects in parallel rather than one at a time thus utilizing interleaving, focusing on deepening my understanding of materials I already know a bit about in the form of overlearning, figuring out ways to win against pitfalls in misunderstandings because of prior knowledge or Einstellung, and working against procrastination plus more. This is a great course that many people can benefit from and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have learned from Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. As a computer science undergraduate in college, these mental tools are very useful and students of other fields can benefit as well, from humanities to business and beyond.
Learning how to learn is a real thing that complete changed my life and attitude towards many things. It was mentioned that when we are born, our brain is not supplemented by the manual guide. I think this course can be a real manual guide for many of those who have taken this course. It explain the nature of our brain. When we ask plain questions such as why we should go to bed early or why we have to learn every day and shouldn't cram, sometimes we get very vague answers which cannot meet our expectations. After this course, I could totally understand the nature of my brain and my behavior. I could change my patterns and get rid of many bad habits. I am sure that this course could boost me even more. Also after this course I decided to learn Chinese. I have never thought about it, but having been inspired by Barbara Oakley I could make this very unexpected for me choice. Also I have notices that my memory skills somehow became better. I will highly recommend this course to my friends, students and many other curious people. I would like to thank the University of California, San Diego. and Barbara Oakley for this wonderful course. Best regards, Andrew Liberman
I have time and often started online courses and left them midway. This one, I completed within a week. The course was terrific in terms of high-value content as well as its lucidity. It provides clear, no-nonsense takeaways, which you can apply in everyday life to learn a new skill. It directly addresses the common fears everyone faces and gives you tools on how to address those fears.Some very high-level takeaways are as follows: Exercise helps you learn better, Switch between focussed and diffused (relaxed, leisurely mood) to maximize your learning potential, getting a good night's sleep is very important, deal with procrastination right-away, don't get disheartened if you don't learn something in the first go...get away, try to recall and get back to it., don't keep hammering at something which is frustrating...get back to it later, repetition is key to acquiring new skills and getting better at it, but do repetition regularly over several days and months, testing frequently your new skills is key to acquire those skills, skipping back and forth might be a good idea to solve a bigger problem consisting of many smaller problems, and many more tips and ideas.
This is a wonderful class.  The entire team at Learning How to Learn have put together a marvelous course which teaches us how to learn. What I found very helpful was learning that there are things you can do to achieve competence.  Becoming a skilled learner is not magic or genetics or esoteric techniques but rather very basic things: putting in time and making it a part of daily living like eating or sleeping, practicing over time and not cramming everything into one day, making the study period consist of varied methods and material, doing self tests, challenging your self by doing hard things to deepen understanding of a topic, recalling material by closing the source or book and trying to make a brief summary statement, using mnemonic methods, analogies, metaphors, visualizations to really help you remember.  The most important take-away from this class is that learning requires me to do certain things.  If i commit to doing these things, then i can learn anything.  Doing a little every day and keeping at it will help you to gain mastery in whatever you wish to learn.  Thank you so very much for empowering manny many people by sharing these methods.
This  is the first class I had ever taken on the open online classes.  I took it to be prepared to take other classes. Honestly, I  figured it would be kind of like a reminder class on studying.  The Professors are amazing. The have set a high standard for other classes. There was never a dull moment.  It was so much fun and I learned so much NEW information but  Not only did I learn it but I completely understand why it works. it is great having insight into the brain and how to have it work for you. This is not the standard study skill class at all.  The names says it all.  I still surprise myself on how enthusiastic I am when I get the opportunity to use the information acquired . It really works . it's like being able to depend on a really good friend. They are always there to help you pull through and won't leave you hanging. My favorite is the Pomodoro technique. if you procrastinate this is the one to help you get stuff done.  I have incorporated a lot of what I learned into my daily life.  After being in many other classes, I have to say this is the BEST class I have taken. It's the knowledge I use most. Keep up the good work Barb and Terry!!!
Wow, I definitely learned a lot of new things about how important it is to take our brain and the way we think and process things into our consideration with our learning. It is super significant to incorporate the right techniques into learning things and understanding things or you might not learn that much at all. ANd retaining information and actually being able to recall it yourself and test yourself on it and do these other things to really know and be confident in what you're learning is also a good thing to do. This course has so many beneficial tips and the advice that they provide definitely confirms a lot of the things that I thought might be right before on instinct but didn't really know for sure and now that I have the knowledge to use all these approaches to learning properly, I feel like I can truly ace all of my classes, maximize my productivity, and hopefully use the extent of my capabilities. Or at least more of them. Highly recommend taking this 5/5 stars just really simple and straight forward stuff that will help save a lot of time and provide a lot of useful brain shortcuts that you were never taught in school. 
💯🎯
I loved this course - the subject-matter was interesting, the instructor was endearing, and the content was incredibly easy-to-grasp, fun and engaging.  The retrieval quizzes were well spaced out and super helpful for embedding the new knowledge, and the expert interviews were great as well.Two potential improvement areas: 1.) The videos featuring Barbara Oakley (which was most of them) are very low-volume.  I had turned up my device speakers and the video player volume adjustor to the maximum levels (and tried on multiple devices) but it was really hard to hear some of them without straining, and having to download the transcripts in order to follow along (which meant missed some of her hilarious visuals).  No audio issues with the other videos or in my other Coursera classes. 2.) The practice quizzes allow you to see WHAT you got wrong in a given problem (and indicated what the correct choice would have been), and explained WHY it was wrong, but the actual quizzes don't reveal either.  This made me feel anxious every time I got a question I'd gotten wrong on a previous quiz, since I didn't know what exactly I'd gotten wrong or why.
I wanted to hold off on reviewing this course immediately after completing because learning is something that can only be demonstrated over a long period of time. I feel that it would be dishonest for anyone to review this kind of course which stresses the importance of spaced learning and long-term memory/chunking the moment it's finished.After closely practicing the methods and techniques (emphasis on spaced learning method and recall technique) throughout the course and finishing the Final exam of this course, I wrote down all the important terms, concepts, and techniques with each of their respective definitions on Quizlet.I put this whole Learning How to Learn course into the back of my mind for a month. No active reviewing of any of this material.A month goes and I check my to-do list and it says "Do Quizlet's auto-generated tests which uses your key terms and definitions that you wrote down. No reviewing for this test."I got a 100% on this informal test after not having done any review of Learning How To Learn's material after a month. I am confident in saying that if you properly execute this course's concepts, it will work.
good afternoon, starting from this course, I thought that it would be a banal cramming of the material (I studied this way sometime 23 years ago), so even in project work for students I recalled this with the phrase: we all learned something sometime and somehow  .  But this August-September there was a radical change in the idea of ​​learning. the idea that a lot depends on yourself, the simplicity and availability of explanations of teachers, interest in the topic throughout the course, the application is real !!!  Techniques and Tips from Barbara Oakley Terrence Sejnowski Teachers - These Tips Help It Truthfully, Practically And Easily For The Student To UnderstandSo I don't want to part I'll watch the video materials again and save more recommended materials for independent studyI am grateful for this course because it gave me more confidence in myself and my abilitiesmany thanks to the translators who made it possible for students without knowledge of English to listen to and read this course - we learn how to learnI am grateful to the guests giving interviews and practical !!  applicable guidelinesTHANKS going further👩🏻‍🎓
Como una persona bilingüe y un hombre de 29 años que jamas creyo que podria ser buen estudiante recomiendo muchisimo este curso, no solo me ha apoyado en las areas academicas de mi vida si no tambien en mi vida personal, ahora uso el metodo Pomodoro hasta para limpiar mi habitacion, estoy eternamente agradecido con los doctores Baraba Oakley y Terry Sejnowski que se tomaron el tiempo de hacer este curso, de verdad lo disfrute muchisimo y aprendi mucho mas de como aprender, sin duda algo que planeo aplicar para generaciones futuras.As an bilingual person and a 29 year old man who never believed he could be an A+ student I recommend a lot this course, not only because it has helped me on the academic aspect of my life but also in my personal life, i even use the Pomodoro Technique to clean my room, I am forever grateful with the Doctors Barbara Oakley and Terry sejnowsky for taking the time to do this course, I really enjoyed it a lot and i learned much more about "How To Learn", without a dobut is something that I plan to teach to future generations.Thanks a lot Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski....and Happy Learning everyone!
I had been facing the lack of commitment and strong procrastination for a long time when it come to online learning. I have enrolled and unrolled many courses for years and never had one completed. 4 weeks ago, all of this changed. I logged into my Coursera account again after one year to try for another start and to keep myself learning during this COVID-19  and viola, I saw that I have enrolled in "Learning how to learn"  a year ago. It's just a perfect timing. When you are having difficulty keeping your learning going and been giving all the excuses, this is the best course to start and I am happy to say, for the first time in like years since I am on Coursera, this is my first course that I completed and currently I am on another course and is half way through. Pomodoro has been my daily tools for both work and study. 7 to 8 hours sleep and exercise are my priority. To do list before going to bed keep my self motivated waking up next day knowing what I needed to get done. There's so many great tips and I feel like I can do more! Thank you for this amazing course! I can now say  with more confident that I am a learner :)
Ramesh completed this course, spending 3 hours a week on it.
There are lots of opinions on how to learn, which from this course it has provided me with research-based outputs that somehow or the other gave me a new understanding of learning approaches and techniques.

Some parts are actually within my knowledge and practice, such as metaphors and analogies + visually.



The teamwork seems to be providing a great reflection material. As I found that sometimes I am uneasy to perform all the time teamwork as there are times where my opinions are rejected due to my less influential behavior. And, having a community that looks high on opinions, the influential skills are considered as a leadership norm in teamwork. However, spotting errors and noticing it from other team members are really useful. For example, when we are developing software which requires counter checking our codes. That is why we are now practising Pair Programming, even many similar communities do.

Great course. I will need to train to have a good "holistic" right-brain from now on.

BRAVO to Dr Barb and Dr Terry.

Thanks

Sincerely

Amazing course. Concepts and ideas are explained very clearly and thoroughly, and all study techniques taught in this course are based on scientific facts and research. Furthermore, option videos show us fantastic examples of people who succeded at learning, and they are all very inspiring. I don't think I can explain how much the ideas taught in this course touched me deeply. For years I've been thinking that it was pointless for me to study properly because my memory is not that great and I would forget things in a matter of weeks. Well, Barbara & co. made me realize that the development of my memory and my brain is in my hands (and not only in my genes) and I can actively work in order to improve them. Now, I won't probably get a PhD in Engineering, but I feel that -with the right motivation and study techniques- I can really achieve almost everything I want. It's really a great feeling. Thank you so much for this course. Highly recommended to everyone, but especially to those who feel insecure about their study methods and academic achievements. I wish someone taught me all of this when I was actually a student!
This course is potentially useful to anyone at any age from any background.  There are useful tools in this subject matter that can help most any learner learn any subject more easily whether in an academic environment or a non-academic environment.  This course is more than a self-help course because the course lays a foundation as to how to learn any subject matter.  Because this course is contemporaneously based in scholarly and scientific research, social science, and especially brain science, the learner is benefiting from some of the most recent and sound knowledge available without pedantic complexity.  This  course takes some very complex knowledge and makes that data easily accessible to most learners such that the learners may become self-actualized.  This course can be truly transformative in nature because this course will change a learner's perspective about how to learn anything and change a learner's perspective about one's self.  This course is not snake oil.  I know because this course has changed how I learn and changed me as a person.  In short, this course has positively changed my life.
It's strange that I didn't know about the information in this course before. It makes learning fun and easier than what I used to. It's not about math or science, it's about everything you learn in live.

I recommend this course to everyone who want a better learning approach. This course is a good start to know about learning.

a Quick summery for the course:

1- It's important to know you need to study and rest. It's like exercising, You need to work, but you need to rest to let your body build the muscles.

2- You need to get the big idea of what you are learning before diving into deep details. It makes getting the idea easier.

3- Procrastination is a tough problem for learners, but you will be shocked of how easy it's to tackle it.

4- It's important to know how the brain works

5- some people are talented. others need to work harder, but that doesn't mean they are worse. If they worked harder, they will show you their true potential. Example: People with ADHD, They have to work harder to grasp the information, but once they understand it, they will be creative with it.

I wish my review was helpful.
This easy and accessible course provides some guidance for studying more effectively, based on research in neuroscience and psychology. It gives a grounding in some fundamental cognitive processes like chunking and our working memory systems.Later sections discuss practical tips for study, test preparation and relaxation / self-care.It would be nice perhaps to expand on the section dealing with mnemonics and provide some more concrete, practical examples, perhaps discussing systems like PAO (person-action-object), linking sequences and the Major system for memorising numbers.Also, for language study, there has been a slowly rising interest and awareness of the "comprehensible input" theory of language acquisition popularised by Stephen Krashen's work, and embodied in methods like TPRS or the "natural method". These approaches are very different from how adults typically study second languages, and it would be good to provide some information about them (complimentary, critical or descriptive).Overall, this is an excellent course that I'd recommend to everybody. I look forward to more from the authors.
I wish I had known this before entering College or University. Most of the content feels like common sense in a way that we all knew this and that were the steps that we had to take to learn better. However, this course reinforces the information so well with logic, explanation and passion such that now, there are no excuses I can make to deny that procrastination is something I can understand and avoid. Learning is certainly up to an individual's willpower to consciously plan your schedule, break down goals, stick to your goals, and most importantly, be consistent by taking a day-by-day approach. Never forget to look at the big picture; conversely, don't focus on the product. Enjoy and trust the process. Simply reading a new passage today can go a long way if you step back and realise how far you can go, or you have gone, just by completing 1 simple pomodoro today. Thank you Professors for the enjoyable learning experience. The first step I am taking is to reinforce my learning from this course onto my learning for my academics. Thank you Coursera for making this course free and accessible.
It's a useful and interesting course for me.I had graduated from university for several years.The long I graduated the more I felt hard to learn faster and easier.Too much things to make learning planning procrastinated, and I felt fidget, frustrated, and hard to concentrate.I tried my best to find a solution (I thought).I spent much more time on learning,but that didn't work.Once I thought learning new things was for those who were young or high IQ. After I learned Learning How to Learn,I found I was terribly wrong.Firstly, the most important thing is,after I use these methods which the course taught,I find self -confidence feel fun and find learning is interesting.No more frustrated,and no more self-denial. Secondly,learning is a life time work,and the brain is ready for it,I just need to know how to make it prepared.I recommend this course to those who had left school for years,and now who want to learn more.I also think this course is useful for students to study much better.Thank you.(In the end, sorry for those grammar mistakes,English is not my native langue,I studied on my-own.)
Initially I thought this course is going to be boring just by looking at the title of the course, but I was wrong. Dr. Barbara Oakley, one of the key speaker of this course was a humorous person, and I can see how she put efforts into all her content to prepare for a course that goes straight to the point where you can see direct practicality in real life, and also cut downs all the jargons into duh-duh easy to understand languages. I really enjoy my time in learning how to learn from her, and it totally re-shaped my understanding towards test-taking and what is the actual best way to study. I benefited a lot from this course. Let me end with my favourite remark from this course by Dr. Sejnowski, "You have not truly learned
something unless you can teach it to others." To Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski, thanks for your effort in this course. I enjoyed my time learning from the both of you. To those who are struggling with test-taking, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to consider this course, and I believe it is going to have a momentum change in how you approach learning and test-taking.
I want to say a special thank you to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this outstanding course on Learning How to Learn. I have plans to put to practice the material from this course and share the key points with friends, students and associates. I am finding myself already reviewing my notes in my head. My next thing to accomplish today is to order the POMODORO Timer the one that looks like an apple. I also have plans to read more of the additional works on Procrastination and Memory. I feel a new sense of purpose after taking this course. Thanks again to Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, UC San Diego, Coursera, and all of the folks behind the scenes that helped make this the number one most popular online course in the world. I am wondering what student number I have out of the 2 million who have already successfully completed this course? Is this the end of an era of Learning How to Learn? Just maybe Watson A.I. will become how we learn in the future classroom, or on online or at home. Add VR to the mix and anything is possible. We are living in very exciting times.
Couldn't imagine better introduction into MOOCs and strongly believe this course should be included into formal education curriculum as obligatory and one of the most important ones.  That's because it deals with the very basics of education - what learning is, how do the brain do it, what processes are involved and how to use them properly. Understanding this in the first place would make huge improvement to any further learning no matter the skill.Course could be valuable either for those starting their education (giving them proper tools, changing perspective, etc.) and more advanced learners (backing some of their intuitions with scientific data, dealing with some misconceptions, consolidating and presenting knowledge in well structured way). It's all done in layman terms and thanks to dr. Oakley in a very kind, fun and supportive atmosphere.Another good indicator that creators practice what they preach is the design of the course itself - videos served in digestible "chunks", funny and attention keeping quizzes, little reviews, etc. Overall - highly recommended.
Hello, I am an NLP Master from France. I have developped differents skills in learning or life coaching ( Erickson Hypnosis, Neuro Semantics...) Your course is just a very good one. And for free ???? No excuse for anyone who wants to improve its skills about learning how to learn. If You are interested about the functionnal of the Brain that even the best scientist as never talked about until today, I strongly recommand you to read The Hidden Face Of The Brain written By Dominique AUBIER. You have never read something like that. I sware because she reveald what the Brain is for the Traditions and compare the Crown knowledge and the Scientist Knowledge reuniting those both approach that are usually describe as opposite. This books is probably the best TOP interleaving learning you have never read. Thank you so much for what you did. Maybe once a day we will meet. But if we don't you will shall say to all the people you know Cyrille BIKOUTA-MENGA aka WALLO11.37.04 has followed our course. THANK YOU SO MUCH Mrs OAKLEY. Keep going smiling and sharing all your knowledge.
This is by far one of the most rewarding courses I have ever taken! As a psychology major, I really love the way how Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski not only discussed the many useful learning techniques but carefully explained how those methods work neurologically, and I believe understanding the underline neural networks could definitely help us make better use of what we have learned from this course. My favorite part of this program were actually the optional interviews Dr. Oakley did with many other very accomplished scientists and learners. It was always inspiring getting to know how they learned and what they though would be the best way to learn effectively. Also, I have to admit that the way how this class was presented -- one several-minute video for one small topic -- was in effect quite convenient when I felt the need to review a few concepts. I could simply look at the title of video and recall the points involved in the lecture.In short, this class was surprisingly rewarding, and I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn better.
This is a great course, I wish I had learned it before or during my university studies and not many years later. When I started university I had a lot of misconceptions about how to learn in a smart way. High school was pretty easy for me so I never learned how to study hard material, and subsequently I struggled through my years in university. This course is for people who lack the correct learning techniques and habits. Not everyone can force their way through university by sheer brain power - some have more and some have less of it. Understanding how your brain works and how to feed it information the right way, when to give it a rest and which kind of rest, how to leverage your diffused mode of thinking and even how to approach an exam - these are all skills that will help you achieve more, while staying focused and energized.Even if you're busy, this course is well worth your time, and pretty much all of it can be learned without even looking at the screen, so just download the course and listen to it during your commute or your jogging. Thanks Barbara!
I enjoyed the course very much!! Thank you. Highly applicable to my profession (teaching) and really useful. In a nutshell I learnt about - Learning, thinking, memory, chunking, avoiding procrastination, habits, testing, use of analogy and metaphors, and so much more - which I know will directly impact my ability to learn well and to advise my students on how to learn.The videos were short and not too much of a strain on students like me (working people)I enjoyed Dr. Barbara Oakley's way of presenting every topic - very clear, specific and ofcourse warm and friendly. It was like - she was talking to you!! Dr. Terrence Sejnowski tends to do one main video a week, detailing more on the anatomical aspect of the brain.There are plenty of interviews that you can watch, lots of reading material that was available (though I was selective about it). Its however in my list of 'to read'This course was a very rewarding one that I have taken.I highly recommend this course to all teachers, students and even parents who will understand how 'learning' can be improved.
This course ought to be given in Freshman year of High School and again in Freshman Year of College. Dr. Oakley is a wonderful conduit for this information. In week 4 the ADD brain is discussed with examples of what the world considers brilliant men. Amazing to learn why my learning as well as my daughter's has a "delay".  I noticed her brain development when she was a baby.  Day after day I'd try and teach her a new word or sign language or body shape in play.  Days later after I thought okay, I'll wait and try something new, she'd do the thing I was teaching her days before.  I did not understand this at all.  For me now, I see how and why when information comes into my mind, it scatters and then days later, I feel a knowledge chunk forming.  wow.  This is something I wish I knew many years before. But it is good now that I learned so much about learning and how to feel positive about how best to use what I have to learn new things. Great course.  I believe everyone should be required to take this course early in life... and then refresher later on.
As a chronic procrastinator, I usually get work done in the most stressful way possible because I've never found the motivation to get past all the excuses I make for not starting earlier, even after researching so many study techniques and hacks. This course has been amazing in explaining the reasons that commonly praised techniques work in terms of how our brain actually functions. For example, I have heard that revising at longer intervals will help you remember more information. In contrast, Barbara Oakley explains that spaced repetition will consolidate information from your short-term memory into your long-term memory, as the information won't be considered unimportant and erased from your neural networks. Knowing why these techniques work really motivates me to actually use them.I learnt so many new approaches to studying and life in general in LHTL. I highly recommend it as a way to boost productivity, minimise stress and feel better about the process of studying as something to look forward to, now that there's a framework behind it!
I’m an almost 60 year old lifetime learner, & even though I am a Psychology honor student , I had never fully connected the dots,  so to speak , on how each person’s brain is wired similarly- yet still retains it own unique characteristics/ abilities . Even thoughI i have a background from my college major studies, I still discovered that ones. own  Internal / mental  attitudes , beliefs, can play a role in helping improve a individual’s learning! I very enthusiastically recommend this course , both as a “ stand alone” self improvement genre of course, as well as the whole series of courses which build upon one another that are offered through this application, Coursera.I throughly enjoyed both of the Professors, the guest speakers in some of the videos, & especially the format in which it was delivered.The whole course was a joy from beginning to end; & I now have extra “ tools” for my “ toolbox” to apply toward all future learning throughout the remainder of my learning lifetime ! Time and money well spent to receive the certificate !!
Great course, effective and efficient. They got good sources from various optional interviews which can help learners get an insight into others perspectives and experiences. The course videos themselves would not exceed a 10 minute duration making them easier to watch as nobody is really worried about the lack of time they have. The quizzes are effective and straightforward and don't really get you frustrated as some quizzes usually do. The course itself was a fun experience and can be done in a short time period, even though it says 4 week duration on the course one can even possibly finish it in 4-5 days. I myself finished the course before the four week deadline. The fact that it is a self-paced course not only benefits you as you don't have to stress about any course deadlines, timings, etc. it also helps you to manage yourself and your time in a more effective manner and it's a good way to keep yourself busy whenever you have nothing else going on. It's also a good way to learn something if you have a general thirst for knowledge.
This course is truly life-changing. I took it in order to solidify my studying habits.

I started Engineering recently, and since it's (in Canadian schools) 
quite a math-intensive and very rigorous program, Learning how to Learn 
seemed like a must-do while I'm not neck-deep in exams and homework. 

As a current student, and as a learner, this course is definitely 
something that anyone should do if they want to improve their long-term 
memory and reduce their time spent on studying to assimilate the same 
amount of information. 

In my honest opinion, one of the best parts of this course is that you 
can easily follow it while on transit. For my part, I would download a 
week's lessons at a time and listen to them while walking to the bus and
 while riding it. Of course, I missed some information by not using my 
focused attention so much, but I had time to do my homework at home and 
learn how to learn elsewhere.

Thank you so much for building this incredible course. Thank you even more for making it free.

TL;DR: Take the course.
Gorgeous material, which is from my point of view extremely powerful, 
valuable, as well as very hands-on oriented. I have liked the way very 
much, how the material is presented and how nice the key ideas are 
educated in an easy to remember way. 

Already during the course I practiced a lot of it in real life, e.g. the
 memory palace technique to visually deposit items I want to remember. 
Btw and to be honest, w/o the examples in the videos I wouldn't even 
have dared to be that freaky, funny and evocative with my own memory 
images on such  ;) 

The only pity thought coming up into my mind is, that I should have had 
this knowledge 20 years earlier !  Anyhow, happy event never comes too 
late. I now switch back to master tough subjects of AI Artificial 
Intelligence, which is currently part of my lifelong learning, and where
 I made a little step from to the Learning How to Learn course. I'm 
sure, I speed there up tremendously.

Thanks so much to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team.

A very good course!

It teaches a lot of techniques for studying and test taking as well as information about how we and our brains work. It talks about how we should be doing things to learn in a more "efficient" manner, how to be less anxious as well as some advice about decision making (don't cram, and have a good night's sleep). 

Quite a bit of what is talked here I've seen before in other places. Things such as Anki, sleeping well before a test, good eating habits and exercising (doesn't mean i applied them to my life). But it was nice to have everything put into one place. It's a way to ratify that's what i should be doing.

And there indeed were a lot of valuables knowledge to be learned here. The Pomodoro technique is something I've never heard about before, and I loved and am currently applying it. There are some "pomodoro" apps out there, and the one I'm using makes me feel like I'm gamifying my learning. It's really fun to study that way.

It's a very good course for anyone that wants to become a better learner.
I first took this course when I was at the height of my frustration over learning Nihongo in Osaka. During that time, I had been studying almost everyday for 11 months. I was constantly reading, reviewing, and answering exercises. I often studied until I was too tired to study any more, and yet I could retain the information only for a while. The way I was studying wasn't working for me, and I wanted to know how I can study and learn more effectively. A month after I started taking this course and applying some of the techniques presented in it, I noticed that I was able to remember more of my Nihongo lessons. I actually spent less time studying, but I think that, with the techniques I was using, I was studying in a smarter, more effective, and more efficient way... I continue to apply these techniques in relevant situations in my life now. I also review this course every once in a while. Each time, I find that I still learn something from it. Thank you so much to everyone who came together to make this course possible!
I highly recommend this course to just about anyone as the concepts can be applicable to students, experienced professionals, instructors, researchers, etc.  With today's rapid pace of technology advancement, I find it sometimes overwhelming to know where to even start to understand some new technologies and concepts that are outside of my profession.  In fact, technology within my profession is rapidly changing owing to IoT, so I really want to understand these other technologies that are now working in tandem with my industry.  I took this course in hopes that it would make approaching some of these new concepts easier.  It greatly exceeded my expectations.  Some are completely novel concepts, while others are things I've been doing for years, but didn't actually have a name for them (e.g. diffused mode of thinking).  The course is very easy to follow and I really liked the professors.  They seem to be genuinely nice people who want people to learn and succeed.  I will end as I began.  I HIGHLY recommend this course.
I had an
amazing experience with this online course. Firstly, the course has a great
structure making it easy to follow Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowki! Moreover, the ideas
and exercises are easily applicable in daily life, no matter if you are a
student or already working. The techniques discussed will help with every new
project you try to tackle. Mostly, they emphasize the benefits of learning,
having fun acquiring new knowledge and shows you how you can motivate yourself
to learn. However, they also reassure you to not be too hard on yourself, to
keep practising with the beneficial methods and of course being real with yourself
about your progress. It was a refreshing perspective into an academic world
that is sadly and to our detriment still more focused on achievement than on
acquiring deep and meaningful knowledge. Therefore I really have to say: Great
job!! I am so happy this course exists. It is giving us the reality check, we
so desperately need to understand what really matters when learning! Thank you!
Recently I started using Pomodoro technique to create a habit of regular studying. I must say it works surprisingly good in its simplicity. I start by turning off the wifi on my phone and I close all unnecessary tabs in the web browser as well as other programs. Then I set the timer for 25 minutes and focus on a specific task without worrying if I manage to finish it or not. Sometimes it means to leave a lecture video half way paused or even unfinished line of code but that's okay. What matters in fighting the procrastination is the focus on the process not the results. I use the breaks for stretching away from the computer.Other thing I do is to set up a day limit on a specific hour, just like Dr Barbara Oakley explains in her course. In my case it's 8pm, after that hour I stop studying even if I didn't do as many Pomodoro sessions as I planned.After a while I've noticed that I look forward those studying sessions. :) I recommend it to anyone who struggles with procrastination. Go on and give it a try.
A fantastic insight into the functioning of the brain. Doing this helps 
you to identify bad habits and thoughts that will impede not only 
learning, but enjoying it.

This course does a very good job mixing theoretical explanations with 
practical tips and advices to improve your learning.  However, don't 
expect magic here, there are no shortcuts. You have to be willing to put
 the effort into the material you want to learn.

The beginning of the course might seem a little bit simple, but the last
 weeks are really worthwhile. Specially if you are taking a degree of a 
very complex subject like Physics, Engineering or Math, where the focus 
mode of the brain is encouraged and the diffused mode is forgotten, 
albeit it is  much needed too.

Al thing considered, either if you are an unquiet person, who likes to 
learn constantly, or you simply want to learn how to improve your 
academic performance, this course will give you what you need.

I feel that this should be taught in the first year of college.
I am a Learning Specialist who has been learning about learning for more than 20 years. I coach students in grades 9-12 to apply strategies that will maximize their learning in all subject areas, and I took this course in hopes that it would be a means to validate and enhance my teaching practice. The clever lectures did not disappoint! I learned several new ideas and strategies to bring to my practice, including an interesting test taking strategy linked to focused and diffuse modes of thinking, which I found fascinating and very applicable. I was able to link every lecture to previously learned content on memory, language acquisition, attention, and comprehension. I especially appreciated that the lectures were short and clear; the instructors are obviously well aware of what the research tells us about sustained attention - and they practice what they preach. The spiraling nature of the course was also very helpful; the brain loves spaced repetition! I am enthused for the new academic year to begin.
After just one week of learning with Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, I feel that this is the ressource I have been looking for for a long time. Nowadays, the internet is full of material about personal development, about how  to achieve miracles in fast learning, fast reading, fast calculating, in activating different parts of the brain, ...etc. Though I obviously do not much trust this kind of material, I have always been looking for reliable sources that answer so many questions about learning and about how the brain works during the learning process. Learning How to Learn offers all that anyone needs to know about how the learning process develops in the brain while at the same time learning so much about the secrets of the human brain and its potentialities from brain specialists and researchers. What makes the course more interesting is the reliable and rich resources and the well-grounded scientific research it uses to demonstrate the validity of the learning strategies suggested.
Excellent course! Even though I am myself a professor in an engineering discipline and very experienced at "learning", I discovered new things in this course and I also learned reasons behind some aspects of learning that I know from intuition and experience. It is very helpful to understand the neurological underpinnings for why certain methods of learning and studying are beneficial. The concept of "chunking" is very powerful. The rational behind metaphors, mnemonics, and memory palace is really interesting. The reasons that spaced repetition of concepts are effective, the function of the diffuse mode of the brain, and the simple "pomodoro" technique are all excellent concepts and incredibly useful in learning engineering concepts, languages, or anything in life.  The instructors are excellent, the videos, illustrations and text are well thought out. Highly recommend this course for anyone at any level! I have recommended it to fellow professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and my children.
From different brain modes to research-proven learning techniques, this course not only covers how brain works but also what works for the brain. It is a constant reminder that the brain is a powerful tool that learners of all kind could benefit from knowing it a little better. Besides, this course give scientific backings to ideas such as changing your thoughts can really change how your brain work, and leisure activities are not just good for you, they are essential in stages of learnings etc. These are all powerful life-style suggestions that could help us live better, happier and more efficiently.Lastly, I found taking this course in itself is a power tool against procrastination. A few minutes a day of listening to the videos got myself start thinking about my learning methods, and I would usually go to with a productive day of trying to challenge myself according to the suggestions from the class videos. Thank you for such a great course. I only wish I could turn back clock and take it earlier.
Learning how to learn didn't start out as a course I thought I would be very interested in. I took it because I could audit it, it seemed like a kind of easy class, and I wanted to make sure I could handle taking a course online. But this course turned out to be great, and I would recommend it to anyone doing anything, but especially students in school. This course should be required for all high school and college students. It teaches you about which study methods are most effective, how your memory works, how procrastination works, how to reduce test anxiety, and much more. The videos aren't always so engaging, but that's because it's a lecture, and they're cut up into short pieces, so it's easier to focus on them for a limited amount of time rather than an hour long lecture. I'm really glad I took this course and I'm grateful to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for allowing people who aren't enrolled in their university to take it. If you're wondering whether to take the plunge, I say do it.
I always remain excited to learn new skills. I had my  birthday exactly 10 days before today.I was just counting the new skills I learned in the previous year the list includes, volleyball, mandala, speed reading , journaling and etcetera. When I found my sister talking about this course it was like my dream come true .I was looking for a course of this kind for so long and the good ones are often expensive, but what coursera is providing is  qualitative  filtered material free of cost. I have a list of skills I 'm about to learn this year and I know that the techniques like pomodoro,  planning before sleeping, using two modes of thinking ,chunking , sleeping well ,exercising , memory PALACE will be of remarkable help.The most astonishing idea that had just stuck in my mind is that you can change reality by changing your thoughts and perseverance is more important to be successful rather than only being smart.THANKYOU so much Barb and Terry for teaching me things in simple and  deep way .
This Course by Barb & Terry is amazing. It has opened many new thinking fronts. Or I can say developed an understanding about how to learn. How the mind works and, how one can overcome with the difficulties of learning new things or subjects. Before starting of the course, I am not confident of myself that I will be able to learn this course or any other course as earlier, I used to start a course and, then soon after starting, I never return on that course. But, with the help of Barb's easy instructions or I should say very simple teaching techinques, I started liking the course. And, then also practising their teaching on day to day life. It haven't changed me fully but yes now, I have changed so many things with the help of this course, that itself is a great thing. I must say one should take this course and, it's very helpful, easy, simply & beautifully taught by both the instructors. Thanks for their valuable inputs and, making changes in the many lives. Wonderful & great work.
Top class course presented in a straight forward and practical way. They give you bit-size pieces of information that you can easily learn, apply learning methods to the real world (it does not get to theoretical) and they actually practice what they preach. For example, at the end of each part of the course they ask clear questions to secure you recall your key learnings. There are also short and simple practical tests at the end of each section which are supporting your own development and learning. The course has mandatory material and additional material which is of interest but not required, In addition, you have the opportunity to review short papers developed by fellow pupils. You can opt in or out for that but I opted in and found it very inspiring as people were very open and vunerable about their situations and learning opportunities. Great course! Would highly recommend! My own objective was to support my own learning as well as to learn tools for teaching others.
I took this course a starting place for my self learning journey. This is ultimately he best learning course I've ever taken. The material is easy to digest, presented in an engaging format and there is a lot of room to grow. While most first year teaching courses focus on teaching students theoretical applications of learning, this course is focused on teaching each participant how to identify their own learning strengths and how to work on their learning difficulties.Both of the presenters are engaging, although Barbara did a much better job of connecting with the audience than Terry. The featured guest talks should really be mandatory as the information presented by the guest helped to bolster the topics covered in the course.All in all I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who is learning anything ever! This not only allows you to learn about the theoretical applications but will give you the tools to understand why and how you as an individual learns. 5/5!
Highly informative course, very fun and concise deliverance of teachings which makes learning how to learn exceptionally easy. This course undoubtedly equips you with many highly effective tools to use in the pursuit of knowledge in any field. Highly impactful and greatly recommended to anyone at any age who is interested in gaining mastery in any field.The knowledge gained from this course goes beyond the realms of academic study and can easily be applied to many avenues of life. The skill of learning is essential and beneficial and this course not only provides knowledge on how the brain works, but gives key insights as to how to harness your brain to engage in deep learning and understanding of material. The interviews of persons who have displayed great prowess in learning and memory allowed captivation and motivation as to what is humanly possible. It was very impactful to know what has worked for persons and to be able to incorporate these methods into my learning.
A wonderful course that collects various important tidbits of information related to learning and an explanation of how these can be included in our daily routines to make ourselves more efficient and effective learners. The beauty of this course is that:1. It's a collection of ideas, tools and techniques that you would normally need to scan several sources for. It collects them and presents them in a way that is most useful for learners.2. The videos and short and easy to grasp. Rather than overloading students with information, it has been broken down into smaller 'chunks' (ha) that are easier to process. This course should be mandatory for students across the world because even though our educational systems make outcomes quite clear, there is little explanation of what a good way to achieve those outcomes is. Great work by everyone involved. Highly, highly recommended course for anybody struggling with learning anything new or just wanting to become a better learner.
I really loved the course, I was looking forward to the classes, which are light, relaxed and packed with valuable information.
I can say that I went through a journey of great reflection, self-knowledge and retention of valuable information.
The course introduces various aspects of the learning process, from how your brain and memory work to tips for passing tests. In general, all the tips presented do not apply only to specific academic subjects, they apply to any aspect that we are trying to understand / know.
Class information is light, clear and objective. During the videos, and as new concepts are presented to us, old concepts are continually recalled, rooting the concepts learned in our memory. Tests are also of great value for fixing what has been learned.

I offer my most sincere thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski who were at the forefront of transmitting the content, but I also thank the entire team behind the production of this incredible course.
Participating in this course was a high point on my weekly task lists! Barbara and Dr. Terry have incredible attitudes and are so motivating and encouraging, making it a delight to learn from their exceptional knowledge. They compile the information in a way that is easy to follow and understand and offer realistic and practical insights backed by a lot of science and empirical evidence. They even apply the tools and resources they recommend throughout the course, driving the ideas home through immediate practice. I found the course to be truly enjoyable and incredibly helpful! I have recommended it to friends and family throughout the time I have been taking it and will continue to do so! It is helpful for any age or demographic. Whether you are in the midst of your studies or need to warm your engine back up after some time away from learning, Barb and Terry remind you to take charge of your own learning and provide you the tools and kind motivation to do so!
After finishing that course I can say that it is quite useful. If you 
are not a biologist you can learn some new things about the structure of
 our brain and how it works. If you are a biologist, you can refresh 
that material :)

Although I had known a lot of things that were mentioned in that course,
 I could look at them from the other side due to teacher's explanations 
and my own insides. 

Also that course helped me to structure all that mental tools and gave 
new knowledge. Moreover, I noticed that I began to really USE a big 
amount of the methods for better learning. 

The atmosphere is great there. I got a lot of possitive emotions. 
Teachers show you how to use different tools with examples. What's more,
 they use that tips to make their own videos. If you notice that, you 
have even more examples and you can feel how it actually works.

So, I recommend you that course, especially, if you want to become a little bit better version of yourself.
Being some 44 years since formal education, and probably 20 since any work-based training, I primarily took this course to freshen up the grey cells prior to returning to work after an extended Covid furlough. It was also to give me some tips on latest thinking for assimilating new information which I was then going to apply to other online training materials, more specifically work related. But it became a fascinating project in its own right and I would love to spend more time looking into the further reading and possibly even tackling the Honours assignments. More likely for the To Do list for retirement, just for interest.It is fantastic that professionals in the business of teaching and research have given their time freely to produce such accessible and enlightening materials - thank you Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski. Being of the Star Trek generation, such sharing of knowledge does give hope that humanity is on the right track :)
There is a lot that can be said about this course. I will try to keep it short. This course, for me, was a refresher, in the sense that I needed to get back on track. Specifically, I needed to get back in the mindset that fosters learning. I enjoyed the course and would recommend it to anyone. It has given me the can-do attitude needed to continue assigning time to learn new and existing subjects. Moreover, it has opened my eyes to the notion that procrastination does not have to define you, and that with a little will-power, one can achieve anything.Full disclosure: there were times when I temporarily lost focus, became bored with the content, which was primarily due to the fact that I was not using the techniques discussed in the course, such as the Pomodoro technique, which would have helped me tackle the course with more mindful intent. To anyone that is interesting in the fundamentals of learning and best practices, this is the course for you.
Are you feeling that your memory is slipping and maybe you need to do something to keep on top of things?  Or spending your time studying for courses but not feeling you're getting enough out of it as you could?  Or perhaps you just want to understand a little bit more about how the brain works and how you can get more out of it?  If so, Learning How to Learn is for you.  This lecture-focused course offers many great insights and tips for studying more efficiently and learning more efficiently--whether you're still in school or long graduated.  I really looked forward to the next week's lectures and often watched them more than once.  I finished the course feeling like I learned new tools and was reminded of other things long forgotten.  The weekly quizzes and challenges after each lecture help to ensure that you are understanding the finer points of each week. I decided to take this course before taking other MOOCs. Well worth the time and effort.

It is beginning of innovative learning process for me once again with creative
insight. It is very favorable to person like me who is professional
already and completed doctorate long back. The process and skills have been
explained so well in this course that I was able to get connected with
motivated student in me. I was very happy to practice with Pomodoro technique
and I started working on it while I was studying this course. I also appreciate
the spaced repetition for efficient learning. Coming from behavior
science background I feel the scientific base of this course is as strong as skills aspect
of it. I learnt to relax while learning as well as I experienced joy of learning.  Though,
you may be highly educated, as a student of this course you can always progress further. At
the end I will like to thank DR. BARBARA OAKLEY & DR. TERRENCE  SEJNOWSKI for launching
this course on COURSERA
I am amazed at the improvement I had during the weeks, sometimes I used to get very distracted and have memorie problems, the first two weeks were a bit more difficult, had lack of concentration, I had trouble remembering the things I was learning, I had to readjust my deadlines and decided to rewatch week two videos, but paying more attention to my focus, reduce any distracctions I could have, work with a "mini Pomodoro" technique, starting by at lest the 10 min of each video I would fully concentrate on the video, and litle by little weeks 2-4 were so much easier, I realized how I could keep more information, I was more focused while I was studying, if I didn't get something I would go back to make sure I was understanding the idea, I was applying the tools I was learning on the days coming by, many "fun facts" about our brain, really interesting material, I highly recommend this course!  Thank you team of Learning how to learnLaila
Absolutely terrific course, easy to digest, and perfect for first time MOOC'ers. I was familiar with a few of the techniques and didn't realize I was already doing them. It was awesome learning some of the science behind how, and why these techniques work.  This course has definitely informed me on some EXTREMELY use-full learning and studying techniques!  I highly suggest getting Barbara's book as well; it is also easy to digest but intellectually stimulating. While it is not necessary during the course, it is an excellent tool for interleaving your learning by reading the book after completing the course. The optional interviews are very helpful as well, they are structure to be part informative and part review and part inspirational; the instructors clearly understand the concepts they are discussing.  After altering a few of my habits, I have already experienced a big difference in my learning abilities.Thank you Terry and Barb!
Excelente curso, muy completo, recomendado para cualquier persona no solo para estudiantes; estas técnicas y formas de manejar tus estudios son practicas en cualquier área de tu vida. Muchas gracias a las personas que permitieron que este curso sea posible, gracias por su esfuerzo y gran dedicación, a los invitados y los queridos profesores Barbara Oakley y Terrence Sejnowski por compartir sus conocimientos, y por supuesto a Coursera por estar para todos nosotros en todo momento. Excellent course, very complete, recommended for anyone not just for students; These techniques and ways of managing your studies are practical in any area of your life. Thank you very much to the people who made this course possible, thank you for your effort and great dedication, to the guests and dear teachers Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for sharing their knowledge, and of course to Coursera for being for all of us in everything moment.
I loved the course especially because of how short it was, and how compact the videos were. It gave me the information I could use, without being dry or boring. The additional reading material and interviews were fascinating. The biggest positive I got from this course was a change in my thinking. I used to believe that your scores on tests were determined mostly by genetic aptitude, and even if I studied smarter and harder, I wouldn't do much better. After applying what I learned in this course, I see I couldn't have been more wrong. I actually enjoy the process of working now, because it can be interesting, and doesn't involve as much of the self-hate and negative emotions that are a result of excessive procrastination. I'm excited to sit down and get stuff done! The course also encouraged me to check out other methods for increased productivity that I'd heard of, like having a system of accountability partners and kanban.
Just completed the course. The introduced ideas and concepts seemed helpful and interesting to me. I learned a lot about why my brains doesn't like studying and how to improve my learning experience. I even got a tool (-> Pomodoro-Technique) that was of huge help for me personally to finally start developing some discipline. What I also liked about the course is that a lot of the techniques, like spaced repition, find direct practice when following the course. The course doesn't just teach you stuff about learning, it actually shows you how to learn by doing. Before the course I had lots of problems and wrong ideas about learning that were tackled by this course, like the idea that I need to be really motivated to learn, or that I often made the mistake of focusing on the outcome of my learning. Now I know that the focus should be on the process, the product then comes on its own. I'm very glad that I went through with it.
This is a really great course, I am currently a student on a nursing degree, and though I am aware of some techniques to improve learning I am always happy to encounter more or to reinforce my knowledge.  The course is set out very well and the way the topics are covered with videos, readings, quizzes, and interviews is very interesting and helps cement the information being discussed.  A big shout out to the two teachers Barbara and Terry, they present the information in a clear and simple manner, and you can see how they are passionate about helping people to improve their learning skills.  I am so glad that this course was one of the ones recommended by the team members of Class Central that I was able to discover it.  I doubt that anyone at any stage of life or learning will regret the course so please do enrol and give it a try.  Please enrol and enjoy the course and happy learning.  Also, love the zombies :)
This a great course! If I had taken it 30 years ago, I would have a complete different life now. But it is never too late to take it even I am in my middle age. I like the course that has a lot of neuroscience research back-up so that the learning methods suggested by are more reliable. Although it is scientific research base, it does not mean that it is away from the practical purpose. In fact, the topics are very practical for any learner. And the course helps me to resolve a lot of doubts on some "myth" about learning methods. I also like the optional interview with different successful and adventurous learner in the world. The stories of the guests are very encouraging and inspiring. Their special learning methods also echo the content of the course. It strength my understanding of the concepts. I feel full of hope with positive mind and practical methods to begin my new learning journey in my new career.
I'm a Med student, currently participating in a help program for younger students, I participated in this course as part of preparation for it. It's not the first learning course I take and I must say it's one of the bests.Its a short, simple and accurate course that gives you small but incredible useful tips and information to perform better at actually whatever you are trying to learn. It focuses on the way our brains work and gain knowledge, whether its artistic, scientific or even muscular (dancing, gym, etc), so whatever you may be facing this course will probably be useful to you.The course is short, does not demand tremendous amounts of time and the teachers and videos are of excellent quality and content, also very charming and kindI must rate this course of a 10/10 completely recommendAny age, specially school students and college students, but hey! we never stop learning so feel welcome to take it
Great course for everyone, even if you are not interested in learning. It will equip you with many techniques that you also can apply in your job or life. In the course, you can face several rather complex concepts, which initially seem difficult to understand. But the way Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski present the material makes them much easier to understand. They use good picture analogies and metaphors to explain the material. I'm not a native English speaker but I took this course and passed all tests successfully. It made me believe that I can do much more about learning, helped me not to give up when I was about to drop out of my English classes. I've learned that when you struggle with a new concept, you just need to approach it from a new angle to make understanding smoother. And it's very important to let your brain have a rest from time to time. Thanks for teaching me how to learn.
The course have given me a great motivation and a lot good ideas, approaches to self-improvement and good news about my brain. For instance, doesn't matter your age or a talent to the current science, you can try to do something new and get success, if you learn effectively. The teachers Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Thierry Sajnowsky based all them conclusions on them own experience and practices, so if they told regular exercises help to learn effective, I believe. Maybe that only one advice I haven't tried yet - it's a running, according to the extremely snowing weather in Kiev now... But I will do it with understanding of helpfulness for learning, switching mind mode and solving a difficult problem. If you finish the course, maybe you won't become a professor, but you get a keys for the progress in learning, planning working tasks, overcoming procrastination etc. So learn or don't, isn't a question now.
LHL is my one of all time favorite MOOC. It helped me rethink my entire understanding of learning and equipped me with powerful mental tools (in all earnestness) that made my learning more conscious. To mention an example: I had the habit of writing down everything when I started learning something new. I will keep on writing down points to the extent that I feel I am comfortable with the subject in a short span. But I have wondered at a later point of time for myself unable to recall the subject/ topic. Only after taking the course, I learnt about being falsely confident about things when we are obsessed with writing. Likewise, I could mention several personal benefits I received through the course. Another point worth mentioning is the weekly email from the team. It has useful recommendations of books and websites related to personal development. Thank you team for bringing out this wonderful course.
Great course! Really helped me organize my thoughts and reduce most of the stress that I am going through in my life. It touched many interesting topics that I have learned to enjoy learning during high school and college, and it definitely touched them in a creative and quiet striking way. Many thanks to the professors, Mrs. Oakley and Mr. Sinowski (forgive me if I misspelled your names, but spontaneity brought me here and I can't go double check them! I'm sure you understand! :)), to the students that have shared ideas and contributed to some of mine own. I wish we used technology to build groups and share even more. I hope each and every one has enjoyed and learned as much as I did! Thanks to the University of California, San Diego, for such great content and beautiful package! Thanks to Coursera for providing such interesting topic and allowing me and people from all over the world to enjoy it!
This simple methodology can be transposed to any learning or problem-solving challenge. It not only gives you a structure but also helps you understand how learning and the brain work and how to make them more effective.Pr Oakley is down to earth and explains very well. The course is well structured and she uses a lot of the techniques she preaches such as analogies, story telling but also testing and recall. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski helps us grasps how the brain and learning work. This course gives technics that can be applied to life for learning and problem solving. It will prove useful to anyone: teenager to senior - it will help you be more efficient in tackling challenges.The optional interviews are very interesting and you meet a bunch of individuals, masters in their fields thanks to their own version of these techniques. It helps connect the class to different areas and ripens your horizons
Astonishing and inspiring Barbara! If only all teachers were like you! And some insightful speakers too. I have not stopped talking about this course lately and I am encouraging all and sundry to take it. As a "middle aged" person I feel now like a 3 to  11 years old: eager and stimulated. This course has unearthed some new learning methods and also consolidated my numerous intuitions as regards to learning and my own potential. I am ready now to take on seriously  all the challenges that I have been procrastinating on for ages such as Maths (aaargh), learning another language, coding and much more for the rest of my life. Come on I dare challenging you that you will most certainly find out quite a few things you thought you knew not and many more that you had absolutely no clue about. What a great course in its positive approach to your own hidden abilities and multiple facets to learning. Enjoy!
Professor Oakley and Professor  Sejnowski,  I would like to take a moment to thank you for your deep and well put together lectures as well as the many interviews with professionals.  Although I was not able to push forward with the written assignments , this course gave me the inspiration I needed to challenge myself  and has inspired me to look at things in a renewed prospective. I have always dreamed about going into academia, but felt that I was burdened with many learning disabilities. Such as never being able to take tests or reading to slow or not being able to write well, and even being diagnosed late in life with dyslexia. I hope and intend to use what I learned in this course to fight off the demons that have prevented me from finding my  passion. I feelthat though the lectures and interviews that I can break the shackles that have limited me from doing what I never thought possible.
Exceptional and amazing course to start learning. Thanks coursera for keeping this course as free and this course is going to motivate and help so many kids, students and even elders to unlock there potential and many disbeliefs regarding intelligence.The professor explains everything in a really simple manner and it was a surprise to see all course not more than 4 min. None of topic looked complicated to understand, very nice paced with images, videos.It was pleasure to complete this course. Course material are really intensive and you could sense the amount of investigation and research has been conducted by the team to come up the course.Main highlights Interviews at end of each week from highly intelligent people with tips, solutions which worked for them. I am a believer now that anyone can learn anything. Thank you so much for making this content. You are truly helping mankind here.
Thanks  Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!  Just super helpful. This course is a life changing MOOC and I believe I should be teach in primary or high school or at least in first year of the university. I was skeptical to take this course because I believed that I was a good enough learner but I found so many useful knowledge to apply on a daily basis. I have already used pomodoro technique and have done a TODO list almost every day for several years but I focus always on "the product". Now I'll start to focus on "the process" and do my TODO list at night rather than in the morning. And also I'll do more "active learning" like retrieve the material and test my self and I'll spend less time in "passive learning" like re-reading and doing mind mapping without any test in between.Thank you for teaching how to learn. I'm Fernando Conde.And until we meet again, happy learning! :-D
This course contains invaluable information to help you succeed in life. The instructors back everything they say with lots of good and interesting references, which are available to consult at the end of each module.They presented some strategies for studying that were really useful, the best ones being "test yourself" (practice testing), distributed practice (space repetition) and interleaved practice.Students can also learn quite a bit about procrastination, memory, sleep, mindset, motivation, creativity, overlearning, chunking and other complementary resources that help you learn.I especially enjoyed the optional interviews at the end of a few modules! If you read every single reference mentioned (including books), you may end up spending well over four weeks learning from the material presented in that course. Otherwise, this can be done in a few days at most. Highly recommended!
For as long as I can recall I've had problems to remember things I thought I had learned. But just short ago I realized I was unable to remember things. I wondered why I was so good at anything I undertook at the moment and all the content that I had seemingly storaged in my brain disappeared. Another thing that caused me a lot of terrible consequences was procrastination. I can gladly say that it doesn't have the same power over me. Now that I know what It is and how it works It's become easier for me to deal with it. I've found the Pomodoro Technique highly effective and insightful.By taking this course I was able to find the failures that were holding me back in my learning. This course has enabled me to be a better learner. The tricks provided in this course doesn't take a super overwise person to grasp and put them into action.Thanks for teaching me how to learn more effectively.
Definite eye opener.  Think back to junior high (Grade 7 or 8) and think how you approached homework.  Look at a problem, look at the solution; "pfft, I got this, this stuff's easy" Honours certificate please!But then you got to high school and thought, "hmm, I kinda got this stuff, I should be good for the test" and thus proceed to cram your way through every exam.  Marks? Varied, from yeah, not bad to absolutely MEH...University? More of the same.  Your job, a little better, but kind of FEEL meh...It's ok, you just didn't know how to study properly.  This course will teach you how.  And more importantly--at least for me--the why.  As you'll see CONTEXT MATTERS A WHOLE BUNCH when you're tyring to remember stuff.And couldn't do this review without a shout out to Barb (the girl in all the videos).  Endearing, encouraging, so knowledgeable.  Check out her interviews she's really good.
This is a fantastic course and is appropriate for people of all age groups, who are interested in learning. Learning keeps our brains agile and young and as i have learnt in this course, age really doesn't matter.

I am a senior citizen who has just superannuated from a career spanning nearly 39 years. I am lucky that i got introduced to Coursera and further to this course through my sons. I believe, completion of this course will be a game changer for me, during my second innings. Till now i thought that i had a weak memory and i could not retain things. This is a self-image of the past, and now i know that learning and remembering is a game with a set of rules which can be learnt and mastered,

I have started learning a new language and certain other skill sets getting help from the tips and information i gathered doing this course,Thanks Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terry Sejwonsky
Wonderful! It was enlightening to watch these incredibly experienced and talented professionals "personally" explain these eyeopening topics in such a simple way in the comfort of my home, or wherever I was.  The videos are short enough so I could advance at any time, but are so compelling, once I started, I found it difficult to stop! Plus, they provide visual aids which make the facts so memorable. The optional interviews are very enriching and inspiring, loved them! The fact of having so much additional bibliography is another big plus; you can go deeper in the subject if you desire to. I learned plenty of new techniques to learn better and reinforced some that I used. I will definitely put everything to use! It was a true delight, thank you Barbara, Terrence and everyone! I will hold this inspiring experience within me for a very long time. Best of luck to all of you!
This course was extremely helpful to me in so many facets of my life.  I wish I had had an opportunity to learn about these learning methods while in high school so that I could have used it in college and even throughout my career.  Understanding how neural connections are created and made permanent are important components of learning and retaining all kinds of information we encounter in life.  I've even used these tips to improve my golf swing.  Repetition makes permanent!  In summary, this course provided insight that helped me discover self-destructive mental roadblocks and bad habits that could be addressed once I became aware of these issues.  I now understand that I'm not alone with these issues (procrastination, test taking anxiety, the impostor syndrome, etc....).  I strongly recommend this course for those on a path of self-discovery and personal improvement.
I thought I would finish this self-paced course in a couple of days, but my 30 second summary of the first week's materials was that learning takes time. So I took the full 4 weeks to complete this course. This course doesn't reveal some new and amazing technique that enabled me to become a walking encyclopedia overnight. In fact I had already heard of all of the techniques. For example, I've tried 30 second summaries before, but I wasn't good at it right away, so I decided the technique didn't work for me. This time I treated the techniques as something I would have to spend time learning how to do, just like any other skill. Because the course became about learning new skills, I really enjoyed it. If I'd just done what I'd always done (take notes and memorize them), then I would have been bored witless, struggled with motivation and procrastination, and dropped out.
I could not say thank you enough to everyone involved in this course, I am full of gratitude for all the information, technics, method and experiences shown to me ... every video added something new to my brain. I was quite surprise that I was already doing a few of the things mentioned here, I was always told that I was doing it wrong but through this course I learnt that it was perfectly fine, in fact it was the right thing to do so I felt a lot more confident now than ever, I won’t stop here ... this course has encouraged me to carry on with new studies and keep loving to learn, thank you so much Dr Barbara ... the way your talk is so soothing to the brain it felt that it came from you heart .... I am extremely thankful for this opportunity to do this course and  I could not be more grateful! Please keep us teaching us as do ... because you do it great.Karen
I am a continuous learner and love to learn new subjects/areas.  I have been doing this during my Bachelors, Masters and while pursuing doctorate (12+ years) in Engineering.  Personally, I have got to my own way of learning.  Attending this course, I understood why and how my way of learning works. Also, got insights into how I can improve my learning process. I also used the companion textbook which provided lot of information and real-life examples to support the key ideas in the book. I really enjoyed it.Thanks a lot Prof. Barbara in bringing this course & book.  I understand and appreciate your effort for sharing your own experience in learning  subjects that were alien.Thanks for helping most of us understand better our own learning process. This is my first course in "Coursera" and I am very happy and excited me to chunk more. Thanks a lot Coursera Team.
The best online course I've taken so far. This is not an exaggeration. Throughout the course, I truly felt the importance of the material taught and their applicability in my daily life. I've started using the Pomodoro technique (with the help of an app) when tackling projects at work or want to be productive at home (taking an online course, learning some new skills). I also owe it to this class, and this might be a side effect rather than a direct impact, for bringing my brain to a more relaxed mental state. In other words, the topics about focused/diffuse mode and the discussion of thinking patterns provided a much more clear path not only for approaching tasks, but also escaping from that constant loop that eventually leads to a headache. Without going into more details, this is a wonderful class for anyone, anywhere accessible to take. Happy learning!
This course was absolutely awesome! Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski introduced the information in such a manner that all learning styles had the opportunity to grasp it. It was informative and interesting; pertinent and thought provoking. The quiz after each module was key in helping to chunk the material presented each module. Each module and quiz included a bit of humor, which made the learning experience enjoyable. I'm definitely going to be aware of how I study and strive for maximum efficiency using the techniques taught here. Additionally, I'm going to buy the suggested books so that I can use them to help my math students to better learn and enjoy the topic.  I learned in 4 weeks what I didn't learn during more than 20 years of formal education. Thank you very much Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski!! I rate you both as my favorite professors ever in learning.
I signed up for this course with the intention of using it to help me make the most of later courses I'd like to take, but I was shocked at how much of it is applicable in everyday life. I have many projects that I (would have liked) to be working on but had trouble finding the motivation to do so. What I learned here about handling procrastination - the pomodoro technique, focusing on process rather than product, etc - has helped me become both more focused but also helps me allow myself to relax, meaning I'm more ready to take on other projects, positive cycle etc. What I learned about short- and long-term memory, chunking, creating interesting metaphors, and so on, has had a direct impact on my ability to do my job well and commit relevant information to memory quickly. If you are considering taking this course at all, do it. It's quite worth it.
This was the first only course I've completed ever. And actually with high grades. The lowest grade I've got is 83%. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their learning, or want to try to experience what online course is, as there is a high probability that you will complete it and get a confidence that you can complete something that requires a systematic approach. One of the reasons that this course is easy to complete and learn, because it's not overloaded by heavy readings or so. If you decided to take this course, I would recommend to chunk your learning, for example, I did 2 videos each day, so you're not bored or overloaded. Also, it was effective to analyse the script first, make notes and then watch a video of this script. Good luck!And huge thanks to Barbara! Looking forward to see you in Kazakhstan this September!
Very well prepared material: videos, interviews, further reading, quizzes, tests, with many opportunities to dig deeper into the topic. Professor Barbara Oakley has an easy going, but always professional approach, with a great care for details and a tremendous ability to put them into the big picture and make learning fun and easy! Everything was really well curated and of high quality. Big contributions also come from Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, which talks more about the neurological aspects related to learning. I have learned quite a lot of interesting techniques that I can use to improve the way I study, even if I am at the end of my Ph.D. ! And not only techniques, but also insights on how the brain works and how to relate this to the process of learning. Absolutely suggested to anyone interested in learning deeper and probably faster than before!
Dr. Barb Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are two inviduals who have come very far in life regarding academia. They are experts in their fields of study as well as two people who pushed their cognitive abilities to a considerable length.
It is with this knowledge that I can surely recommend anyone to take their course Learning How to Learn. They went through the length of making an easy to follow program capable of teaching anyone in any language more about the process of learning and how to become better at it via practice.
Do away with all preconceived notions of not being smart enough or believing someone is simply born gifted. This course will break those ideas in order to expose the truth - that our brain's intelligence and cognitive abilities are much like any other muscle, thus, it can be strengthened via disciplined training and practice.
I loved the course. Until now, I was learning not knowing how things are working, how to retain better.  As  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski said "Using most efficient machine in the known universe without instruction manual".  I learned about different modes of thinking and how to use them efficiently, different types of memory and how to learn better and for long term, Chunking, Illusion of competence, and ways to be more productive and learned about procrastination as a habit to deal with it efficiently, test taking techinques and what not!. If you are reading this review and have not joined the course. I would highly recommend you to enroll in this course, its life changing. Without exaggerating, It is the best course i have ever done. Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, LHTL team and coursera for this wonderful learning experience.
Brilliant course, which makes learning how to learn very simple. The step-wise tips shared as so useful and doable. Understanding the physical and mental preparations towards learning are very well explained. How learning takes place and what are those barriers to learning, that need to be avoided, has been explained in detail. Every concept has been explained without  any clutter around it. Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have taken great pain in developing and explaining the various mental tools and their usages, very clearly. I specially liked the parts covering the 'focused and diffused modes', 'chunking', 'memory', 'rebuilding', habits, 'procrastination', the pomodoro technique, 'Einstellung', 'eat your frogs first' etc,Overall,  a program that I should have years ago. Luckily I have now undertaken it and very happy about it.
I am a sports coach. I learn by doing, best. This course helped me retain some of the other courses I am learning about sports coaching, accountancy, finance and management. I was struggling to retain all of it because I was unable to use these lessons (Corona lock down).This course showed me how the brain works with analogies. I have a good plan to study and retain what I learn now. It will also help me reinforce and keep information that I need to do different things (stay healthy, cook, etc.).The second category of value provided by this course is how it helps you create a learning process for yourself that will make your learning deeper, help you keep procrastination at bay and teach you to reduce your dependency on motivation and will power for various projects.It's a life skill. Learning how to learn.Grateful that I found this course.
While procrastinating preparation for the Series 7, I somehow ended up on the signup page for the course. It sounded interesting and since I was already having difficulty studying, I figured I'd give it a try. It was not at all what I expected... to say that 'I learned how to learn' from this course is an understatement. Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.Terry Snejowski (and team) integrate current information, sophisticated concepts, and effective techniques into a simple educational message for a broad audience to understand. The tools to gain from this class are universally applicable and will always be useful . The time commitment is light, convenient, and flexible- it works with anyone's schedule.  As instructors, Dr. Oakley  and Dr. Sejnowski are warm, welcoming, and motivating about their coursework. There is something for everyone to learn.
I highly recommend this informative course for anyone pursuing educational courses or interested in life-long learning. I became interested in this course, and coursera, through reading Dr. Oakley’s Mindshift book. I’ve gained many valuable insights which I’ve started applying to projects at home and work, and plan to put the techniques to work in upcoming MOOCs. The tips on overcoming procrastination are helping me make significant progress in home organization efforts I have been putting off for months - all while listening to the encouraging course lectures online. Dr’s Oakley and Sejnowski use gentle humor, fun illustrations, and an engaging manner to communicate valuable tips. I’m looking forward to joining the other courses that they have developed. A big thank you to both of them for helping me jump-start a new journey in learning!
Its a very practical and useful course, and applies to people of all age groups and disciplines. The concepts and techniques are useful to become aware of how our brain learns new material, and how we can adopt effective learning strategies in our lives. Although, I am not in school anymore, I was able to incorporate the teachings in my regular schedule like when reading books, viewing videos or taking other online courses. It is not a very demanding course, which makes it an easy recommendation even if you are squeezed for time. Also, it helps that the instructors keep a very motivating atmosphere and are cognizant of participants in all stages of learning difficulties. As a bonus, there are interviews of experts from various different fields and it is great to get another perspective from them on how they manage to learn effectively.
I am an upcoming junior in high school, and I discovered class central through one of my teachers. As I searched for a course that I wanted to dedicate my time to better myself as a student and individual, I came across this one, and I am very happy and grateful that I did. This is because all throughout, both instructors constructed this course with a very interesting, intriguing and fun foundation. With their guidance, and energetic teaching I was able to grasp at new ways to look and take on my studies. My most valuable take away from this entire course was the pomodoro method, which I now apply to my academics daily, and has so far worked efficiently and has helped me slowly suppress procrastination. I really really recommend this not only to students, but to anyone who finds themselves in need of some self-enriching guidance.
Great course. I completed it over two years with long breaks in between the sessions. Though I didn't do it deliberately, I think it is better to complete it this way, slowly letting the lessons sink in, instead of finishing in one go. The content delivered is pretty simple but it is something which every person needs to know since improving ourselves is essential for improving our society and these basic lessons can help you learn ANYTHING faster and more thoroughly. The reason this course is so awesome is that deals with a bottleneck in the current generation's personal development process - ie. they know very little about how to learn effectively, and this course deals with it pretty well.Everyone should start this course, and there is a pretty decent chance that with a little drive you'll be able to complete it.Happy learning!
This course is really great for the people who don't have habit of learning new things.  This course definitely hep how to deal with more Scientific, Logical, Art, Literature, Technology type of topic. This helps us to get confidence that we can Learn Anything and Everything, it's matter of time some people do it fast and slow. Understanding the context is more important and foundation come with understanding and using best techniques to learn the new things. Metaphors and analogy should be used while learning, in order to shift from to transfer the items from current working memory to Long Term Memory.We should periodically recall, attend the test, avoid triggers to procrastination and be prepared as well as relaxed before the Final Test. Better to be excited on learning through processes and automatically will get the result.
This course is extremely interesting and useful, regardless of age, profession or future prospects.I already knew about most of what is covered in it regarding the brain, the techniques and everything, but only superficially. This course goes in-depth on a lot of known things about the brain, procrastination, time management etc. and summarizes it very well, in addition to dispelling false knowledge in the same domains.The course itself is very well structured and comprises regular quizzes and tests that, although seemingly silly, help a lot in memorizing the contents and realizing how true what is explained is.It also offers a very wide range of additional material, be it video interviews or further reading, for anyone wanting to dig even deeper on one particular subject.I personally enjoyed it from the beginning to the end :)
I spent lots of time studying at school during the past years. But no one teaches me how to learn in a scientific and effective way. I found I did waste lots of time before and previous school life really made me feel frustrated.  Before I spent too much time on rereading, making notes and highlighting. And I did not complete the exercise after math classes in time. I did not have recalled the material and crammed the material before the exam. These are all my bad learning habits. This is the most precious and useful course in my life. It is a life-changing course. I found some qualities that make me different. I decided to change some ineffective learning ways and some ways of thinking. I really recommend that everyone should take this before high school or college or from now. I really appreciate these professors. Thank you.
This course is amazing. It teaches us about many interesting things about how our brain works, how what we experience are related to the mental models we have, and the best ways to make our learning journey easy and fun to experience. I didn't know much of the stuff in this course even though I am a learner, I love to learn and I'm trying to find every day a way to improve myself. Learning how to learn provides us with both practical and biological explanation about how we do effectively learn about a subject. Moreover, I found the "extra" interviews to be very very interesting, I want to thank Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski, and the whole Leaning how to learn team. You made a great job. I loved the course. Thank you, guys. I hope you and every person taking this course will have a meaningful life full of thriving and joy.
I absolutely loved this course--it's fun, a confidence-booster, and it has completely changed the way I study and think about the world around me. I love that it takes concepts that would normally be intimidating, such as 'neural pathways', and 'diffuse and focus modes', and puts into them simple terms, like "pin ball paths" and "zombies". I've learned why certain chemicals in the brain react the way they do, and what stimulates them, and how to better plan and learn the subjects I'm taking. This course also has special tips for those learning science, algebra, and languages, as well as how to better prepare for tests, and how to take breaks efficiently. This course works for all ages and levels; middle school to college, and all subjects, from music theory to chemistry. Do yourself a favor and enroll. You will not regret it.
Learning how to learn is a fundamental subject. I would recommend it to everyone who considers themselves a scholar/academic/student of life, take this course if you're pondering about it. Becoming a better learner improves everything you're studying. I wish this course was around when I was in high school/university.The intro didn't hook me right away like an award winning TV series but it quickly became very interesting.The course is sectioned into four parts: Introduction, procrastination, memory and renaissance learning (more tips and advice). As a procrastinator, I benefited from this course tremendously. But I enjoyed the entire course not just that section.I can say with confidence it's helping me with my TAFE studies right now.Thank you to Barbara, Terrance and Coursera for creating this MOOC.Ancora imparo, Tri Tran
It's such an amazing course which inspire me a lot in learning. I'm kinda keen on self-studying and this course help me a lot of things to enhance my self-study ability: using both focused and diffuse modes when studying, practice makes perfect, using pomodoro technique for a specific of time to enhance your focus, time break and sports are also important to enhance your brain's activity, many techniques to avoid procrastination and improve memory... You must figure it out!The lessons were awesome with many useful information and visual examples with awesome teaching ways of Professor Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski. You will like the way the talk, it's not only about teaching, it's about sharing. I also love the interviews between Professor Barb Oakley with many professional people in their fields, can learn a lot from them.
Very clear, crisp teaching. One can see that much effort of thinking and design went into constructing the course.  I especially appreciated the use of illustrations (the zombies, vampire, and such) to illustrate the ideas while creating a powerful (humorous) visual associations with the material covered. The sections were short and concise, making it less threatening to engage, as well as a feeling of accomplishment and progress.  I also liked that the quiz questions weren't about tricking the student; rather, the testing were part of the teaching process.  In short, the teaching method put into practice what is being taught. It was the first Coursera class I've taken, which has been a true positive experience which inspires me to take additional classes, using, of course, the tips and skills I learned in this course.
This was a fantastic course--one that I wish I had taken years ago. The nuns always told me I shouldn't cram for a test, but they never really told me why. Not waiting till the last minute was an admonition right up there with "Eat everything off your plate" and "be nice to your sister." If I had know that that I would actually learn more, probably study less in the long run and do far better in school if I studied at regular intervals and actually tried to recall the material--as opposed to highlighting text and re-reading chapters--I would be less inclined to put homework and studying off till the last minute. And I would have done far better in school and remembered much more from my classes.  This course is a must for anyone who wants to be a better learner, whether it be in math and science or in the humanities.
I just finished this great course about learning how to learn and finally understood the reason of its great popularity.    Although the learning process and the tips may seem simple and  logical, but the design of course is outstanding and highly creative. The course applies practically the princibles it conveys already through the  videos which is brilliant. In addition, the instructors teach you why are these ways or tips of learning important through neuroscience and provide you with great amount of resources and research papers that make your subconscious mind more aware about the importance of how you learn the material. The course also intends to change your mindset about the importance of continuous learning and exploring your potentials through your whole life. For me it was a great and exciting experience.
Superb course, simply exceptional.This course has hit home in many of the problems I've faced throughout my life not only in studying and learning, but in doing the very tasks I consider important on a daily basis.The material is fun, engaging, intuitive, and above all interesting.Professor Oakely and Dr. Sejnowski have done a marvelous job producing such a great course, and presented the material in exceptional grace and compassion. To say I've enjoyed the journey this course has taken me would be an understatement - it is one of the most important experiences I've ever had.I cannot thank you enough, and I will be recommending this course to as many people as I can - I believe this course can be timely for anyone, at any age, at any level of education.A 6 stars out of 5 possible ones for you,Thank you so very much.
Learning How to Learn is a beginner level study skills course. Its content can be compared to all sorts of text books written for junior year college students to help them put things in order from the beginning. However, this course is informed by most recent neuroscience. What you will hear in the videos is not only practical, but also the simple truth about how your brain works and how you can learn. As a beginner level course, it doesn't take you to the roots of things they teach or any technicality. If you are curious about why and how, you won't find the answers here. But that makes you a specialist, not one of the target audience of the course. In general, Learning How to Learn does an excellent job for its purpose. The course and Barbara Oakley's 2016 book with more elaborate content, are highly recommended.
This is the most useful course I have taken in my life. 
The lessons are practical and useful. 
I see much improvement in my learning abilities & I am more confident now, than before taking this course. 
By adopting the techniques I learned in this class, I am learning new subjects to advance my career. 
I had been working for years and out of college, I had many doubts about my learning abilities, in particular of new subjects.  This course cleared my doubts, dusted off my core abilities. 
Great collaboration of the instructors, Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. 
I am very inspired by Dr. Barbara Oakley.  I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering. 
This is the BEST value for my money. 
Grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for putting this invaluable course.  Best Regards.
I first heard about this course through others learning to program. I finally decided to start it, and I'm very glad I did. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski both clearly know what they're talking about and their lessons and information opened my eyes to how to efficiently learn. I will likely have to pour over my notes again and again to make sure I am learning correctly.What I found the most interesting was how sleep rids our brain of metabolic toxins and that there was two modes of thinking: focused and diffused. I believe these will have the most impact in my studies. If anyone is on the fence about taking this course, as long as you are interested in improving then I would suggest taking it. It's free after all!Thank you for making this course, and I'm interested in reading the book as well.Best Regards
The course was absolutely brilliant. It opened my eyes to the problems I had recently encountered with making a career change and learning the subject matter as easily I was used to. The course also provided both easy to implement strategies for learning any type of subject matter as well as backing up those recommended strategies with scientific fact and relatable examples from their personal experiences with learning or by sharing stories about accomplished scholars and scientists who experienced failure and self-doubt on their journey to success. Dr. Oakley and Dr. Senjowski presented the material in a very down to earth but fun and professional manner. I would highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone wanting to learn something new or deepen their learning on topics they are already familiar with .
I found myself lucky that i found this course on coursera, attended it and completed it. Its not just a course but more than that. Given by professor Barbara Oakley, this course not only helped me to improve my learning method but also taught me various things, like various techniques to increase my learning power, memory power, etc. Apart from the course curriculum, what i found most informative were those interview sessions with people, professors from different places. You can gain a whole bucket full of information by watching those interviews and going through the supplement material that Prof. Oakley has included in this course.I will suggest this course to everyone who are having a problem while learning new things. Great Course by Great Professor. Thanks Prof. Oakley for teaching "Learning How to Learn".
This course is a brilliant, succinct and scientific illustration of the proverb- " the learning period for human is actually from cradle to grave"!!!!! I have just completed this amazing course and I highly recommend this course to each and every human being who is willing to learn!!!!!! The most wonderful thing about this course is it makes you confident of the learning journey by familiarizing you with the hiccups of the journey and also the necessary ammunition to overcome those . I, a career banker for 15 years and mother of two, sort of gave up the idea of formal education/online degree mostly due to time constraint. After doing this course, I figured that time is not a constraint- the real constraint was my attitude. I'll remain grateful to Barb, Tery and the whole team forever-  I am simply overwhelmed.
This course is extremely beneficial for people of all ages. Best approaches and techniques helped me to learn and understand materials in an effective manner. Knowing about how our brain works and applying things which doesn't waste our mental energy is the main purpose of this course. All the faculties had really helped me especially Ms. Barbara Oakley. She was very much passionate and was very much focused on getting things understood by the students. I personally recommend everyone to watch the optional interviews too as it gives us a whole new perspective and we can learn a lot from it.Classes were to the point and didn't beat around the bush which is that one feature I always look for in any course. Special thanks for that. I am very much confident that this will help me a lot in my life. Happy Learning.
I am fully in love with this course. OMG! If I just would have found this course years ago, I would have saved so much stress and questions about why I am not learning anything from the bunch of text books and articles I read. Now I know I didn't have the right approach and I was just letting information in but it was all lost in the jungle because I wasn't taking the time to form any chunk. Another problems I had, illusions of competence and not taking brakes. Of course, after LH2L, I take brakes and repeat material more frequently to myself. I try to use my diffused mode to recall important information and stick them on my long term memory. Thank you so much to Barabara Oakley for all the interviews to different personalities and for her fresh demeanor while explaining concepts and facts. I just love it!
I was so surprised that I totally covered the courses  independently. finally I finished it by my efforts. actually ,during in the period of learning courses online , I thought I just had a try to learn it , but at last I REALLY kept on learning the courses after everyday's work. I did it .Thanks a million for your  high-quality courses which inspired me to challenge myself and build up my own learning style, especially I shared my knowledge ang stories with my students in my class. last but at least learning  here online realised my dreams of receiving education in the United  States ,Although I never went to the US ,I still learned such amazing courses online of the the US. Tahnks so much for offering chance for the people like me to broaden our horizen,build up our confidence  and expland our life !
Dear Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski and the dedicated team in your back, who certainly were part of making this wonderful MOOC possible. As you mentioned repeatedly during the course, learning is a life-long quest and can be one of the most enriching endeavours if one has the right tools to not only know how and where to acquire knowledge but how to make the learning process fun and memorable. The MOOC and the book offer these tools. I have already sent out links - especially to my son, who loves learning but is at the same time a genius in procrastination :) -, to teachers, friends and students and hope that some of them will get inspired by you, the way you have inspired me. I will definitely follow you on Facebook! All the best and once again: Thank you very much for this wonderful  learning experience!
Interesting, engaging and educational! This course is taught in a motivating, fun style that will keep you glued to the screen. Learning How to Learn gives a solid understanding of how our brain retains and recalls information. The videos will help you to beat procrastination, use your time most efficiently when learning new material, and memorize information in different ways. There are lots of super test-taking tips too! Though not required reading, Barbara Oakley's excellent book, "A Mind For Numbers", is a well-written companion for this course. The suggested articles for each week's studies are enlightening and so interesting that you'll read many more than you expected, and come out all the wiser. If want to create a strong foundation for learning new material, this course is a perfect choice.
This course is absolutely fantastic for anyone dealing with learning difficulties, or even trying to find ways to be more efficient at the essential task of learning new things.  It tackles the science behind our minds capabilities to retain information. It also focuses on the cognitive and behavioural sides of compelling ourselves to keep learning from the age of 1 to 100. The chapter on procrastination and motivation was extremely useful to me. After decades of struggling with school and career related courses I finally feel that I can recognize the symptoms and correct the negative behaviours that held me back. The video lectures are very informative. Sometimes the subjects are presented with a touch of humour, which helped me remember more then usual. Beware of the Zombies and Vampire bats.
This is an amazing MOOC! 

Although there weren't any "discoveries of the century" for me, and most
 of the techniques that are covered in this course I suspected to exist 
or intuitive (kinda) "knew of", this course makes it real easy to see 
these techniques, use them to your advantage, and as a result - improve 
your learning and life in general.

By using some of the techniques from this course right from the moment I
 learned them, I moved more easily throughout the course itself, so its 
pretty much self-solving thing!) You just need to start, and then with 
every turn of the wheel it gets easier and more interesting.

Huge thanks to Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowsky for creating 
this MOOC and helping people from around the world to learn how to 
learn!)

Спасибо, Барб и Терри!
This course is one of the best, if not THE best, MOOC I've taken so far.  Dr. Oakley presented the material in a very thoughtful and clear manner.  I understood the material easily because of her approach to teaching. Just as she suggests that learners use analogies or metaphors, for example, as a method to better understand and remember a concept, she also uses these methods to present the course material.   These methods allowed me to do very well on all the quizzes (which was difficult for me in the past).  I thought I knew a lot about how to learn before taking this course, but I was mistaken and had what the course refers to as "illusions of competency."  I now know what to do to be most effective in my future learning endeavors.  It was well worth my time and effort to take this course.
Great course! Dr. Oakley and Dr. Senjnowski are great! This "Learning How to Learn" course is an eye-opener for me as I am able to apply the techniques from the course to help me overcome my learning challenges, such as procrastination, bad learning habit like not recalling or doing spaced repetition, overlearning, too much focus on a minor detailed concept and wasting so much time.  I learned a lot about effective learning techniques, which I have never used or heard of, such as chunking, interleaving, focused mode, diffuse mode, Pomodoro. I am looking forward to applying the knowledge and techniques I learned in this course to help me achieve more and better results in my future learning. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Senjnowski for brining this insightful and impactful course to Coursera!
This is really a best course if you are wishing how to learn! I
 was blocked in many new themes that I was trying to learn and I was 
giving up on many of them because I really didn't  know that I was 
trying by the wrong method!

I'm surprised how most of themes that I'm trying again are flowing well 
after applying some of techniques learned here. The course is very well 
structured and the empathy of the authors makes you learn like you were 
in a class with the best teachers. The bottom of each chapter presents 
links to videos and texts that worth to explore! 

I bought the book "A Mind for Numbers" and I have started to read it ...
 it's great and I'm loving! It's wonderful like the course and also a 
great review with the pleasure of touching real paper pages.  

Thank you so much!
If you are struggling to learn either because the material is too abundant, too 'difficult' or you are just struggling to learn as efficiently as you would like for some reason, this is the class for you!!! Thank you, Dr. Barbara Oakly and Dr. Sejnoski!!!I have now taken and enjoyed several courses on Coursera. Learning how to Learn has been by far the most helpful, enjoyable, and important class. I was absolutely great to explore how our entire body works to help us learn. I took extra time to complete this course because I wanted to be slow and progressively implement the suggested changes. I have experienced a lot of improvement... still working on some of the tricks to fully take advantage of the course and improve to the max.Absolutely one of the best courses online.. and it's free!
-------- this course should be used as a model for all the other courses.   this course tells you what they're going to tell you and then they tell you;   then they tell you what they told you.   then, of course, they repeat what they told you a little bit later and then a while later, and yet again much later .   i'm teasing, slightly.   but this course does what they say they're going to do !they tell you and give you a chance to practice what they told you.   then they give you another chance to practice a little while later, and yet again, much later, etc . . .the subtitles match the speech.   the subtitles are correctly spelled.   the speech is correctly pronounced.   they mix and match the points they're making, interleaving as they go.   this is the way all courses should be . . .
Thank you so much to my Professor Dr. Barbara Oakley for this course I learn to understand myself why I am subconsciously doing those things, such as procrastination. Procrastination is helpful and harmful at the same time if I can not manage it.  Through this course Learning How to Learn, I learned how to manage it to minimize it accordingly when I need to procrastinate and when I need to stop to procrastinate and to go back to my task.  I wish to take again the course to remind myself of everything I learned and to internalized the course.Thank you, Dr. Barbara Oakley, I miss your voice and the closing line in every video. Lastly, may I know how to apply financial aid so that I can have the certificate of this course. I hope to hear from COURSERA Team.Thank you and God bless everyone.
To some the course may feel to be too obvious from the title. But make no mistake, you are in for an amazing journey into understanding the neuroscience of how the human brain operates. The course is kept pretty light and is approachable to anyone over the age of 13 (as per my opinion). The sooner you complete this course in your life, the more you will thank yourself in the future. You will start taking a step back and observe and understand the little cues as you learn a new skill or concept. The instructors have done a great job of condensing the latest scientific research for the human brain, into understandable tidbits for people outside the research community. If you are new on coursera or have been on the platform for a while, this should definitely be the next course you take.
A lot great inspirational content, pleasant teaching and presentation.Some of the transcript-language, when read without the video, is not really clear, but vague. Those instances , there are quiet a few, took a bunch of guessing, to figure out what the interviewer or guest meant to say. A   L O T  of info material . So,if you are one of us-  creatives / artists, you my find yourself a bit overwhelmed. Just take it easy, pick the info you think you need and complete the course, it will make you A) think a lot more about your children, students and your own learning habits. And thats a very good thing. I just got married, after 76 years und have a little 6 year old, who needs help with 'Learning how to Learn' . So this is my opportunity to learn more, so I can help her. Thanks Coursera
Excellent course on 'Learning How to Learn". Dr.Barb's presentation style is amazing. The techniques mentioned in this course are really helpful especially the Pomodoro Technique. I just loved it. Got a basic understanding of neuro-scientific perspective of our learning. Optional interview sessions are just the icing on the cake. It's really an opportunity to hear from legend learners and scientists from varying disciplines and geographies. I haven't missed any of those interview sessions. I would say it shouldn't be labelled as 'Optional'. All students of this course should listen to those interviews.Hats off, Dr.Barb and Dr.Terrence for this wonderful course. Thank you very much for sharing bits of your knowledge for the benefit of us. Waiting to see more courses from this team!!
While nothing you learn in this course seems particularly ground-breaking, being able to hear it in such simple and to the point videos makes all the difference. I felt like I've heard it all before, especially when discussing particular tools like Pomodoro, but this time something finally clicked with me. I think this course should be taught to children so this helpful behaviours can be enforced in them from young age. I'm starting my own journey now with preparations for different certifications in my own field of work, and I'm eager to see how much better can I do with all those tools given to me by this course. Thank you so much for this! I have also scheduled the follow-up course on Mindshift - I will use it to strengthen the already acquired concepts and to build up on them.
Hi All,I have just completed the course "Learning how to learn". It gave me a fresh perspective to look at the process of learning in place of the end product. It is astonishing to get a hold over explanations regarding brain functioning which we looked over carelessly. It gave a solid insight over the reasons of brain activity that we are aware of since ages but didn't knew the technicalities behind it. Particularly, the interviews that Barbara conducted with learners and researchers across the world helped significantly.The mentors: Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley were really helpful with their research and imparted techniques. I would like to especially thank Barbara for her voice through which she made learning simple and enjoyable.Have a happy "Learning how to learn".
At first, I would like to say that this course has bought immense changes within me and in my studying process!
Dr. Barbara Oakley Ma'am is a very kind and friendly person/instructor I have ever met any of my online classes. She made me realize that yes even I can also solve the tougher mathematics sums or any tough exercises, readings, which was quite difficult for me previously. And Dr. Terrence Sejnowsky Sir is an awesome instructor. His learning tips were great to achieve, and also for Dr. Oakley Ma'am. Thank you so much, Ma'am and Sir, for this wonderful course and your instructions.Overall I loved this course and enjoyed it very much. I'll suggest this course strongly if you guys are suffering from how to learn/ achieve difficult things and how to concentrate on studies.
One word ... FANTASTIC! Thank you Learning how to Learn team for your tremendous effort in making this message available to all. You are clearly passionate about empowering learning and also about teaching. This is the first MOOC that I will complete to the end, it it has given me the courage to expand my horizons and learn something new and/or something scary that I never thought I could possibly do - you don't always have to be a 'natural' at something to learn something new. Thank you for showing the world that anyone can be brilliant by implementing some smart, effective, and efficient strategies. As well as applying a bit of grit. Thank you for teaching us how to learn. A great and highly recommended course for absolutely everyone - because we are all life-long learners.
That is an outstanding course! I really learned a lot about how to improve my learning and I am putting this knowledge into practice in many other areas of my life. The distinction of focus mode x diffuse mode helps to understand that learning cannot be an inertial action of only doing the same thing all the time. Variation is extremely important! I also enjoyed a lot the taught techniques like the Pomodoro, which can be life changing, together with spaced learning (I'm using Anki, another course's suggestion), retrieving and interleaving.It also made me deal much better with procrastination! Thank you very much for such an opportunity. I'll take that for the rest of my life and share this knowledge with friends and relatives, to whom I'm going also to reccomend this course!
I really like this course and highly evaluate the materials taught by Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. I actually learn a lot of things in the course and I particularly like Pomodoro technique which helps me deal with procrastination very effectively. I also do understand why we should switch our brain between two modes, say focused mode and diffuse mode, in order to be more productive. I really enjoy this course and would like to share this with my students. I am now an assistant professor in math (I used to be very very bad at math) but I even haven't known how to learn new things effectively until I take this awesome course. I strongly believe that many people would like this course and learn a lot from it. Again, thanks Barb and Terry for making such a wonderful course!
Exceptional course. It is thoughtfully designed to help each person / persona associate their learning difficulties / challenges (from past and on going experiences) and take the right course of action. Both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski were brilliant in delivering their thoughts to make this course a very effective one. I completed this course one and a half years back but did not lose its impact yet. There are many additional resources and very useful interviews of many people exceptional in their fields. I would recommend this course for everyone. I have been getting regular weekly updates regarding this field as part of this course association. Great work. I started Mindshift course hoping that it will bring in a lot of benefits and positive feelings.
I really cannot find the words to describe how AMAZING this course is. I'll start by the basics: the topic is quite interesting and the material follows an ideal structure so it is easy to go through the course. Moreover, this course goes far beyond learning for school or university: it offers tools to hugely improve your everyday life! On top of it, the lectures are short, concise and entertaining. The instructors do not only help you lots to understand what they are saying (it's cool how consistent they are by using the very same tips they mention in their lessons), but also they are tremendously charismatic and to me it felt like they really cared about me even if -clearly- they don't even know I exist. I am even sad to have finished the course. Thank you very much!!!
I strongly believe that almost everyone will benefit greatly by taking this course. I usually don't bother to leave reviews but the course instructors, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, truly deserve credit. I'm just gonna say this... this course will change your life. And I don't say that lightly. I have always thought of myself as a fast and effective learner but even so, this course made me even better so just imagine what it could do to people who think that they are slow learners or who think that they are just not cut out for "difficult" subjects such as Maths and Physics. My deepest gratitude goes to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. I wish I could one day meet both of you and thank you personally. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
I started taking this course to understand and learn better study techniques for the things I am about to learn going forth. I am a Software Engineer at Google currently & after spending 6 years in my career, I wanted to start re-learning some old concepts and many new things. Being a full-time employee, its necessary to have efficient learning methods at my finger-tips, so I could optimise my work-life-study balance, and this course has definitely provided me with those. Simple things like working a little bit on something daily and using recall over rereading has been super-helpful while even learning new techniques that help me with my daily work. I would definitely recommend this course to every full-time student and anyone who is starting to learn new things.
to maintain relevancy and continued success in professional world, one needs to be in an environment of continuous learning today. For many of us who are long removed from their college classrooms, this is easier said than done .  Time is restricted, distractions and many and so are responsibilities. This course provides wonderful set of strategies and techniques to maximize and upgrade learning capabilities. From the very basics - like importance of sleep - to more intricate techniques like recall over repetition -  it is helping me unlearn several things and learn new. It also fills me with lot of hope that it is possible for everyone to learn, and learn better ! Terry and Barbara do an amazing job and by the end of the course, have become something of a coach !
This course was quite interesting and had a lot of useful ideas.  I believe that the techiques taught here would definitely be beneficial for many subjects.  I am a physicican and recognize that many of the areas of medicine may require pure memory and often "understanding" is not really part of the learning.  But the ideas behind making up crazy sentences to help jog your memory of lists is definitely something that I have used and have found very useful.  Although I completed school many years ago,  I still refer to some of those "crazy sentences" to jog my memory when necessary.  I enjoyed taking this course and I thought the instructors were very good.  I wish I could have taken this course many years ago when it could have made medical school a bit easier.
This course should be compulsory in all areas of education from school to universities. Barbaba Oakley is a gifted teacher, mentor and  a great motivator. I always had a trap of "talent and passion" stereotype and now(thanks to this course) it changed. Now i know that there is such thing as neuroplasticity and giving a time to hard work and practice we can change our "talents" and "passions". I always hated this fancy "find your passion" credo and thanks to this course the scientific research proved that it it's a wrong approach. If you are not good at math, logic, or drawing - maybe you will not become Einstein, Bill Gates or Leonardado Da Vinci. But you definitely can master the foundation of this sciences(and far more)  even without having a natural talent.
Not only did this course give me very practical strategies to more effectively learn as an adult (rather than beating my head against a wall), but it gave me new insights into brain development and learning strategies for my classrooms of younger students. Barbara is an incredibly engaging speaker who breaks down concepts into easily processed segments...of course, for a scholar who dedicates herself to learning about learning, she is very easy to learn from! Terry is one of the most renowned neuroscientists in the world but surprisingly manages to translate his research into layman's terms without losing his enthusiasm.I wouldn't mind retaking this course annually to brush up on the scientific research and dig more thoroughly into the supplemental materials!
This course was my first course on Coursera and a fantastic way to start my new learning journey. As someone who recently finished my undergrad I wish I had taken this class earlier in my academic career. The clear connection between brain science and learning techniques truly illuminated for myself the flaws in my learning practices. However, the information also confirmed for me the strategies I was doing right in my learning and helped grow confidence in my learning style. I know the strategies i've learned in this course will help me learn the new skills I need to achieve personal growth and advance my career. Thank you Barbara Oakley for your enthusiasm and wonderful lectures, I looking forward to utilizing this knowledge for life-long learning.-Arda
I though at first that the 1st week sounded a tad bit too logical to even bother explaining in the first place but I realised later that it was more than necessary in order to understand the material of the upcoming weeks. The only real, but minor issue I had with with this course was the static noise from the speaker's microphone and at some other times it either popped or it was a tad quiet, forcing me to max out the volume slider to 100% so I can hear what she is talking about.Other than that, this was an amazing course and I highly recommend it to people who want to change their perception of learning as a whole but they lack the foundations or people to fill them in. This course did exactly in a very nice and friendly way, especially with the tests.
This is one of the best online-course ever!!!! Why? The learning process is something that nobody can escapes: from passing school exams, driving lesson, learn to cook for your family, evolve in your career, ... in this fast world, the on-going learning process is a must have skills to succeed in this high competitive and ever changing society. This wonderful and motivating course, help me to gain in confidence regarding my learning process and it helps me a lot to win time by finding the right system = to improve my learning. Their awesome sharing technics, priceless advices and real life situation (interviews) turn this course into a must have class to follow. Thank you a million for helping me to improve my journey and knowledge!!!! Flawless 5 Star!!!
This course rocks!You are thought many different learning techniques and get to know how your brain works in a simple way without too much background information. It's just the right amount of input to get a feeling for it. You can apply this knowledge to every kind of subject. The short videos are easy to persuade yourself to get started. Once started you want to see another one! The lecturers have prepared their videos perfectly and after some videos you feel a little bit connected to them. They are able to do the seemingly unmakeable: Keep you motivated! If I feel myself unmotivated to study for my exam, first of all I watch one of these video sequences and promptly I am motivated again. Thanks a lot for putting this course online! I love your work.
I entirely enjoyed 'Learning how to learn'.  It has given me insights and skills I had not imagined helpful.    It has also shown me that in life we all face hardships of not dissimilar challenges and it depends on us to decipher the do's and don'ts for us to move on and do better the next time or get something going for good or even change something profoundly important in our lives. I loved the short lessons that I could listen to or read in my own time and I loved Barbara Oakley's soft voice explaining the subject in such detail and very often with metaphors. The quizzes after each lesson were set with a sense of humour and this made the whole thing actual fun.  I would thoroughly recommend this course to anyone. Thank you 'Learning How to Learn'!
I am Rekha from Indonesia.                                                                                                During this session I learnt so many things which I was not aware of. For example our brain has two modes of learning focus and diffuse modes, about procrastinating, that it is  when we skip some problems when we feel it hard , about rereading, that it is not the correct way of learning. Recall the understangs, deliberatly practicing and repetitions are the correct way to  learn and memorize. Chunking was so new to me. I never heard about it. The course was little difficult for me. However, I finished it successfully.  I am happy that I got opportunity to improve and enhance my knowledge regarding how to learn.  Thank you so much.
When completing this course, I've realized how procrastinated I am. My friend had recommended this course for me since my 1st college year, but I've actually accomplished this course at MY LAST YEAR COLLEGE by using the tactics and techniques, which I've learned along the way this course, to keep myself engaged and interested in learning how to learn, and it eventually worked. The solid evidence more than anything here is the completed informs from Coursera and I decide to write the review for this course to inform people, who are trying to find out the techniques to learn more effectively and productively, this course is definitely the great start. Using 1 POMODORO (25 MINUTES TIMMER)  to start learning the very first lessons. STOP PROCRASTINATING.
I never forgot this course! I first enrolled in 2014, got halfway through and did not complete it. I returned to finish it up – to review what I learned and to "learn the rest" – in early April 2018. I had purchased the book "A Mind for Numbers" and read it back in 2014. The book is awesome but taking the class and doing the exercises online plus submitting the assignments really reinforced my learning of the key concepts and gave me a start for where to dig deeper. Redoing this class from start to finish (and not simply picking up where I left off) has armed me to face my new challenges. The class is set up in such a way that you can follow it from most anywhere and can do the assignments at your convenience. It is well worth the time spent on it.
There was not a moment where I would find myself bored or uninterested. This course is comprehensive and very well put together. Easy to follow and most importantly the repetition of learned topics were reoccuring throughout the course in different chapters, as well as the tests which really helped the information to sink in without even trying to do anything extra after completing each chapter and taking the test. In addition, this course has great references and sources throughout the course that I could not ignore by not writing some of the authors names down in my personal list for future reading material.Just overall very informative, engaging course that kept my interest until the very end. Thank You so much for putting this course together!
This is a very interesting course. I've gained a better understanding on the the learning process, how the brain works on keeping the information, what are the most common errors or obstacle on learning something new and some useful habit or tricks to learn in a more fruitful fashion. I've really appreciate the competence and teach style of the two teachers which I'd like to thank for their work. I strongly recommend this course, especially for students in high school and University because it contains helpful information on how to be more proficient in text or exams. The course could seem less apt for workers and employees, but for someone who wants to get better in what he does and fails on regular basis, this should be a great starting point.
Learn to learn has-been the best course I've ever taken ! I want to thank Dr. Barbara for her warm delivery. She made the atmosphere safe for me to learn although she was on my computer. I found myself looking forward to coming home from work so I could be with my new friend, Dr. Oakley.  I've been using both Pomodoros: one at work and one at home. My Memory Palace is set with 63 places in which I can place something I want to remember. I'm so excited to use this daily. Although, I haven't mastered everything, I remind myself that I'm forming a habit and there will be days like this and I shouldn't beat myself up when I don't do this well. I'm much kinder to myself as I focus on the process. It's been quite a learning experience. Thank you!!!!!
It's a skill for life and if you think it's a little late in your game of study, you can always recommend it to your friends, kids, or even your grandma. BTW am 43 y.o. and excited that I have came across this course. To set the right expectations for this class or any other classes, you don't count on the results of getting 100% of new and essential knowledge every single time. Depending on your background it will be a ratio what you already know and what you don't know. You just have to take with you what fits you and filter out the rest if you want. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for this course! I already register for the next one with Dr. Oakley "Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential"Max
Upto my secondary education, I was totally blind this subject "How to learn". In my college, through reading psychological books, i used many of the tactics explained in this course. Since I'm an enthusiast in almost any subject, this fantastic, systematic and result oriented course "Learning How to Learn" reveal new horizons to learn more and more to me.The day one I joined this course, I ordered "A Mind
  for Numbers - How to Excel at Math and Science" in Amazon.in, received it on last week. I started reading eager to finish within this week.Special thanks to both brains worked behind this course - Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.Personally recommends to every person who wish to learn new things and achieve new goals in life.
Hello, Thanks authors for creating this course, which both encourages to start learning more on how memory works and equips with powerful knowledge on how to learn. Learning how to learn helped me realize that this is not the product that keep me at my job, but the process—doing my job in English, my second language lifelong mastering I enjoy. What really struck me was that I realised why I was bad at math in school, as Ms. Oakley said, I was "one of those people who can't hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative."It's really worth spending your time on.  Thanks again.
Before the review, I would like to point out that I am a teacher and doctoral student, and I have always been making a double effort to learn new things, and this is what motivated me to follow this course.I also always asked myself questions about what thinking and how my brain works, especially as I try to reflect on my practice and analyze my own way of learning.This course answered all of these questions and more. She introduced me to the wonderful world of the brain and the latest discoveries in neuroscience, and the wonderful Dr. Barbara Wakley and Dr. Lawrence Signovsky provided me with a set of advice and guidance to make my learning improve dramatically.If you are ever considering taking this course, do so. It's totally worth it.
A must for anyone wanting to tweak their learning strategies and understand what really works. Valuable regardless of what you are studying - and fascinating too. You really feel how much Barb (the main presenter and course creator) cares both about learning and the students! I think it is quite impressive for that to come across in a MOOC.I have been recommending this course and sharing information from it to many colleagues and also using it to help support my daughter with her studies (I can't guarantee all teens will respond so well to saying 'it is scientifically proven that this is the best way to do it' as a way to change their study approach, but it works for her!). Thank you to everyone involved in putting together this course.
Dr. Barbara Oakley, Ph.D., P.E.
Hello doctor,
I am one of the students of your “learning how to learn” course in the “coursera” platform. I am writing to tell you: THANK YOU, a BIG THANK YOU, thank you to you and your colleague Doctor Terrence Sejnowski, and your “COURSERA” team. Thank you for your generosity, your caring attitude and your ability to share your knowledge about learning and how to make it more effective.
I am now a retiree from secondary education in Morocco, I was a teacher of life and earth sciences, your course made me aware of my mistakes and my discomforts of my learning, when I was pupil and even teacher. I am very grateful doctor. Thank you very much, you are lovely and spotless. Thank you so much.
Very helpful in refreashing and organizing my knowledge about learning. The course is conducted very well, it's quite easy and fun to watch, the informations are approprietly condensed (no unnecessary small talks or prolonged introductions) and we have multiple, not that difficult recall tests. I've learned quite a lot new things; and the broad range of additional reading and video material is very interesting! I like the fact that informations on which the course is based on, are really up-to-date. And last but not least, I grow really fond of dr. Barbara Oakley - walking, talking, ideal teacher for me, I won't even start making here a list the virtues she represents here. Thank you very much for your work, chapeau bas!
A course that not only teaches you about the brain and related facts, learning, and fun but also helps you to get in a state where you feel like it's a lot more I can do which we usually never thought that we can do.I course that I personally loved a lot and I would definitely recommend it to everyone, doesn't matter what your age is and in which field you are working. Learning is something you can do anytime and this course actually guides you on how to learn anything whether new or old in an effective way and for a lifetime.Last but not the least, I would thank the professors of this course for making such a wonderful, enjoyable, interesting, and loving content.Thank you to the Coursera team for providing it for free.
I have always been interested in learning and teaching, I think it's a very powerful ability of a human being.  I am a teacher and a learner, so I took this course because I wanted to understand more about learning so I can also teach better. I do not regret my decision. I even am thankful that I stumbled upon this course on Coursera. The materials explained are to-the-point and helpful! Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski successfully explain the materials very well that I can understand everything, including the very scientific ones. Also, they deliver the materials with calming voices and smiles! I really recommend this course and I am planning to share about what I learned here to my colleagues. Thank you!
The world needs more Barbara Oakleys. Fantastic course and definitely a recommendation to anyone interested in taking any courses online. The material was amazing and wholesome enough to achieve the purpose, and Mrs Barbara's teaching style, passion and her enthusiasm moved my heart. I'm changed in the way I view learning now and I feel more ready to approach it. Her efforts in compiling this comprehensive information and additional interviews and reading/video materials were just too good.  Dr Terrence was amazing and I loved everything he had to say, both together we're able to take a wholesome approach to tackling so many issues. Thank you so much for your efforts, I bet there are too many that feel the same as I do.
I am beyond grateful to get to learn Learning How to Learn. It has totally changed my approach towards learning. The course has given me the opportunity to revise my learning method, to know what i might have been doing wrong, to know what and how i can do better from now onwards, to know why i always procastinate, to also trust my belief system that progress takes patience, to be mindful and aware of the actions i take and the emotions i choose. I love the additional videos interviews that comes along at the end of every week's lessons. The interviews often gives me many AH-HA moments and inspirations which left me to many self-reflections. Thank you very much. You have made a person better and happier than yesterday.
A very insightful course. The simplicity of the material covered might inspire some to quickly abandon this course on the grounds of "common sense", but I would recommend to these individuals that although the concepts and techniques are easy to grasp and execute, they are nonetheless powerful, and worth investing some time to understanding why they work and how to use them in your own educational endeavors.This course offers students a digestible collection of concepts and tools to tackle those ubiquitous evils which students are all too aware of: self-doubt and procrastination. If you are looking to take a first step in conquering these internal demons, I would recommend this course as the first step in your journey.
First of all many thanks to Barb & Terry for having wonderful session on a great topic. I must appreciate your concept of shifting from focus mode to diffuse mode. Explanation more neural scientifically by Dr. Terry also helped to understand how our brain works and what are different i would say component or section. I like most which is the Pomodoro technique of 25 min focused study then relax, this would personally help me to fridge focus and overcome from procrastination. I must also mention about recall and test technique which can also be very good option of memorizing the stuff rather than reading upside down continuously. Once again thanks a lot! last but not least your interviews with expert were also awesome!
This course is 100% useful to improve or add or change your learning methods. The course structure is clear and step by step every milestone aquired, is always recalled by some test so that it is more easy to memorize...in the "long term memory" :-D Every concept is explained in a simple and flowing way, even when it goes a little bit deeper in a matter.Personally, i already knew about some of these ones, but i have realized that until now i did not use them almost ever; so the point is that recalling them through this course make an huge impact on you to start try them and then effectively start to use them. And since when you start to use them you will learn and memorize more easily and in depth.Kind regards.Enrico
Every one of us finished school, probably a higher school, some courses, so we all are well sure that we know how to learn. So I did not expect much from this course.So I was very surprised how well it turned out to be. It explains reasons and mechanisms behind our well-known way of learning, so some boring or irritating things like rehearsal, or tests in the middle of a class start making sense.I think, I became a better doer after this course. It teaches how to avoid procrastination, how to make skills and knowledge stick, and how to master things you never consider as masterable.Also, organizers have one or two nice tricks up their sleeves to make you pass the course even if you want to slack on the last moment.
I wish I'd known this much about how to learn effectively earlier in my life. Just think how much more I'd know right now! This course is a real eye-opener. Learning new stuff will never be a problem ever again! Barbara Oakley is so enthusiastic and makes everything so simple, that she sweeps you up with her enthusiasm. The process of learning becomes a fascinating subject in itself. I couldn't recommend this course too highly. It's been a real pleasure. But not just pleasurable. I've come away with learning insights and techniques that will help me to increase my capacity for future learning,  that in turn will hopefully make me a more rounded individual. And, at my age, what could be a better ambition than that?
Honestly, I never write reviews and i'm not some bot that also tells people that, "I never write reviews." But god damn, this course was awesome. Partially biased opinion because this was my 1st Coursera course, but I took it very seriously and tried to learn as best as I could. The lessons and insights that were shared in this course are remarkable for someone that is passionate about learning. I enjoyed the videos, the interviews, and the additional readings. The course offered tons and tons of material and resources to further educate your learning abilities. This is a great course for anyone that takes a passion in learning, trying to become the best version of themselves, and values productivity of your time.
This course provides excellent insight into the mechanisms of learning and how they can be harnessed by students who want to get the most out of their study time. The lectures provide useful and practical tools for breaking down complex concepts so they can be more easily mastered, including chunking, metaphor and analogy, story-telling, spaced repetition, recall, memory palaces, and many more. The course also covers tools for overcoming procrastination and test anxiety. Additionally, many great resources are provided for those who are curious and want to delve deeper into the science behind the concepts described in the lectures, along with inspirational and informative interviews with successful professionals.
To all the students pursuing any career of their choice, this Course 'Learning How to Learn' will provide you insight on your habits, studying methodologies from a neurological perspective without using any scary too-scientific terms. This course does not talk about a specific discipline, engineering or medical or literature but the concept and habit of learning as a whole. This course will NOT make you the class topper but it will ensure that you understand how to become one! Along with other core-specific courses, this is a must try and it is time efficient, assignments are easy and can be completed well within 30 minutes. I hope you try this course as it will NOT disappoint you. Learn, Understand and Apply.
I wish I could have done this course when I just started secondary school. Because I'm relatively intelligent I had no trouble in secondary school, I just didn't bother with homework, but I could have really made it all even easier on myself had I had the information that i learned in this course. Now I am doing some marketing courses and when I just started doing them I was struggling. Then I ran into this course, figured it couldn't hurt and since my marketing courses have become so much easier to learn. No cramming, but pomodoro's. Learned how to deal with procrastination and all kinds of stuff. I have actually told most of my friend to go do this course as I think it is that awesome! So highly recommended!
I am teacher by choice and "Learning to Learn" is what I teach. I have learnt many new things on this subject which I will be using in my classes as well as my personal learning. According to me, every teacher must go through this course. This is being given for "Free". There should be no more excuses. By gaining knowledge shared here, you will learn better and help others to learn better. By using the tips, you will reduce the time you spend in learning while improving the quality of your learning. Every student needs to understand the "Process" of learning, so that they can master what ever they wish to learn.Thanks to each person who has made this course possible. May God bless all of you with abundance.
This course has been really helpful, during this weeks I've applied concepts and ideas while playing guitar, I was quite surprised that even when I did not have enough time, I improved a lot, unlike how I used to practice. Is not about strength, or having time. Is about knowing the process of learning and metacognition. I don't even started to use this knowledge in my everyday life, I´m so excited because I expect finally finish my degree and acquire many other skills. With a few principles, that are so easy to follow, we can apply to everything we desire to achieve or learn. My only regret is that I didn't take this course before. This should be enough to improve quality of life of anyone. I'm so grateful!
This course is extremely helpful! Ironically, I started the course when I just graduated from college. I found out that I have been using inefficient techniques to study all my years in school (e.g. using mere will power to force myself into problem solving, studying long sessions without taking breaks, falling into the trap of procrastination, etc.) This course has provided me with many perspectives in studying, and they are so convincing since they are backed up by evidences from neuroscience. The course is full of to-the-point tips and helpful advice, with a minimal level of technical details (just enough for a general audience).Many thanks to the team they created this course! Happy learning, everyone!
Thanks to Prof. Barbara and the Coursera team that provide such a wonderful course of learning. I gained a lot of good knowledge, tips, tricks, and experiences during the course, and also, I have been applying it to my study every day effectively. From the neuroscience perspective, I understand more deeply about my weaknesses that I was not able to call out its names exactly and spent many years struggling with them.  As a result, I feel more confident when I figured out what procrastination is, how to change my habit, Serependity Law, and so on. I will soon be back to school to continue my learning journey, and also, I wish I could share with others everything I learned from this course.My gratitude,Vinh
The course delves into a variety of relevant subjects related to the learning process.
It is built in an outstanding way, so it is suitable for different age groups
with different intellectual levels. Although I would have liked to see more practical explanations regarding the ways one
can apply the information in their own lives, I still enjoyed and gained from
every minute of this course.Barbara
Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski are doing an amazing job guiding the course.
Barbara is very well-spoken and articulated which made it extremely easy to
understand the material.To
conclude, I strongly advise those enthusiastic learners, to take this course. I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors.
It really helped me in so many levels that i don't even know how to delimit its influence on my posterior perception concerning on the act of learning. To establish a concrete example,  just the idea of modes of thinking and the importance of alternating them to access more of my own cognitive machinery to help me to solve problems is on its own enough to say that doing this MOOC was time well spent. By the way, i plan to redo the course later to better chunk the presented concepts and confront them with the mental images that I've created of them when introspecting between lessons. Many thanks for the shared knowledge, and I've already started reading the Mind for Numbers book influenced by this journey.
This is an extremely useful course. I recommend it for everyone, no matter your level of education or indeed your age. I think this course should be mandatory for both high school students and their parents. The main reason being so that students can master these skills early in their years and both parents and students understand, in particular, the value of exercise and sleep in learning. Thank you to all those people who put together this course. Although Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are the faces of this course, I know there were many more involved in the conceptualisation and building of this course. Thank you for making it a MOOC and thank you for such a wonderful clear format that was easy to follow.
I loved this course! I was really useful and easy to apply the tools to my behaviour and other learning activities immediately. I even shared with my partner and friends all of whom were very surprised and pleased with the results. Though the course material is REALLY interesting, I believe it is the delivery that made it GREAT! Barbara made this learning experience for me truly memorable. She has a gentle clear approach and a warm and encouraging nature. Thank you to everyone involved, but an especially BIG THANK YOU TO BARBARA. You should be very proud at your contribution to learning, I think it will have a massively positive impact on so many people. Well done! I will look out for your future courses.
This course is wonderful! This was a good opportunity to learn useful
tools to improve my knowledges. Most of the videos contain
important information to the comprehension about learning process. The interviews
are interesting, I loved each piece of advices given by the professors and the specialists,
I think this experience has helped me to focus my attention on the diffuse
modo, because it is a good way to improve my skills. Another topic I have loved is the procrastination. From
now on I understand better what is happening to me, and how to manage my
procrastination. I am very grateful to the professors, Dr. Barbara Oakley and
Dr. Terrence Sejnowski you are great professors, Thank you very much again!
This course is highly recommended for anyone (regardless of age) who wants to know just how to learn effectively. It is practical and uses metaphors and analogies excellently to drive home the point.If you are having any problem with learning something new, difficult, complex and challenging, here's your solution.If you find yourself banging your head against the wall (literally) when trying to solve problems, then you need to take the time that is required to take this course.If you've been having problems with procrastination (like I was), you'll learn about a tool that will help you tackle and overcome procrastination.Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this. I'm in your debt.
With this course, I learned a lot of new techniques and helpful tips that will help me learn and understand any material or concept effectively. I am planning to employ some of these tips and techniques in my upcoming fall semester at university. This course also helped me look at learning from a different perspective, evaluate my current studying methods, and improve my understanding of the brain and the different ways of utilizing its abilities to unlock the hidden potentials that will allow you to succeed in your studies and life. I recommend this course for anyone who is looking to improve and enhance their learning abilities and studying methods to do well in your future studies and upcoming tests.
This is the best course on Coursera which helps you learn about how to learn anything, how to develop good learning habits , and learning powerful mental tools & strategies for good studying. The instructors are  really very engaging and you will love studying with them. As you walk through this course, you will start applying and practicing your learning of the course and by the end of the course, you will be using this knowledge in learning and mastering any tough subjects or new languages or acquiring new skills in a right , easy and efficient way. This course has something for everyone of any age and is ideal for everyone who is keen to learn anything  quickly or effectively. Happy Learning!!!!!!!
I learned sooooooo many actionable techniques, strategies and concepts that really works if you implement them. One or two tactics in this course I heard about through the accelerated learning grapevine over the years, but here the techniques are backed by credible research, giving me more confidence to apply them consistently.I was initially concerned this course was going to be full of more dry theory than practical application, that I almost skipped it. Very glad I didn't. Each module succeeds in being  engaging and informative in ways that can be applied immediately to one's learning projects for better results or to a less stressful path to the same results....excellence. Highly Recommended.
The course material is great and concepts are awesome. I really enjoyed the video lectures and all the techniques that I learned. The teachers explain everything in an interesting away that allows us to retain our attention. I believe that many concepts I learned will be very helpfull in my future and will allow me change for the better. I already tried to implement some techniques while I was attending the course. I already started to use the Pomodoro clock and how happy I was to check this as a great productivity toll. The course offers a great amount of optional sources of information like more readings and great interviews of special guests. Thank you! I really enjoyed to learn how to learn!
Awesome, Mind expanding and contracting! This course will show you how to turn your mind inside out, upside down, and unlock the keys to transforming yourself in ways you have never imagined. I recommend this course to at least one person a day, and to anyone who wants to become a better student in school or of life. Thank you to Dr Oakley, and her team at Coursera. Applying the principals of procrastination, and understanding to the ways my eating habits were influenced by  the insular cortex and the process of replacing pain with pleasure helped me stop drinking coffee and alcohol, cut down on "comfort foods" like carbs, and meat, and lose 25 pounds within three weeks of completing the course.
After 40 years of not attending classes, this was the perfect way to step back into a virtual classroom and reexamine my life as a perpetual student. This class did much to confirm that as a trained musician, I've learned how to learn at a very early age. Also, I've had some great teachers along the way that taught me that the best teacher is one that teaches a student how to learn on their own. Grateful for taking notes once again and doing little quizzes. I also enjoyed the chance to do a little writing for this class, something I don't get to do in much in my normal life. Looking very much to picking some other classes to attend virtually while holed up with this pandemic. What a great gift!
I truly enjoyed this course and learned new information and strategies I can use personally and professionally to learn and do more with the time available. In my job, I'm constantly learning new things as I work with teams on diverse topics in health and education. While taking the course, I was also writing podcast scripts (for my job) on health and wellness in schools and in the workplace, and I found myself writing them in Barb's voice--kind, pleasant, curious, encouraging. The depth and breadth of this course far exceeded my expectations. I was never bored, and the content was so rich that not a single reading or video felt like a waste of time. I could tell it was a labor of love. Bravo!
I wish I knew about this before i started to study in University. This is a great starting course no matter your discipline that you are interested in. This might be the most self improving and valuable course! But you need to have the dedication to stick with this course. I expect that younger people wont have the discipline or interest in this topic even tough it is very important. If you are like me and studied a couple of years you will recognize your mistaken learning strategies, which is great so you can substantially improve future learning and it makes learning more fun!Learning is not as easy to understand as it might seem. You need to bring some reflection time with you and patience.
What I learned from this course will go a long way in my life. The course was not about tricks and hacks to learn. It was about the art of learning and how to not get frustrated when things don't go as you intended. That process is more important than the product.Dr.Barbara Oakley has a very motivating, warm, and charming personality. Her way of teaching is so visual and full of analogies and metaphors, it is like she practiced what she preached.One more bonus part of the course is that Dr.Barbara Oakley interviews some really renowned and talented people who openly share their experiences.I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is into learning and wants to retain that knowledge.
This is the type of course that all universities or high schools should assure that their students take before any specialized courses. I hope I had this course when I was at university. I am sure it would help me a lot to achieve more than what I already did. The best thing about this course that I feel that it speaks about my inner me. It knew the tricks I did to cheat myself and how I fulfilled myself falsely without gaining the full benefits I planned to gain. It also interprets why I didn't achieve the targets I planned to achieve. Finally, I recommend this course for everybody want to well manage his life, because our lives are a big test in which we need to pass it with high grades.
Incredible. I learnt so much in such a short amount of time. What you learn is super easy to apply and very relevant to every day life and learning. The analogies aid understanding and there are plenty of examples too. The tips are concise, well explained and helpful and I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn better, do better in tests, or just generally be more aware of learning methods and ways to stop procrastination etc. Learning how to learn is a beneficial course and I will be implementing the key ideas in my learning. It is also a great way to spend time (I started the course due to the Coronavirus quarantine), and is much more useful than Netflix!!
They should teach this in schools. Meta learning has been of great interest to me for the past several years and this course has offered many fresh insights and techniques I've never heard of before. What the two hosts may lack in public speaking ability they more than make up for with their broad, detailed knowledge and genuine passion for teaching others the wonderful art and science of meta learning. I bought a certificate not because I wanted to frame my completion of this course on my wall but because I felt guilty taking this course for free. Highly recommended regardless of your occupation or IQ, I honestly believe anyone can benefit from the ideas and techniques discussed herein.
Great course. It's simple and straight to the point.

This is especially valuable to anyone just entering college or currently
 in college. Wish I knew a lot of these tricks and hacks and the general
 understanding of how the brain works back when I was still grinding 
through 50 topics a week.

As an upper 20-something, the most useful parts of this course are the 
videos that describe the fundamentals of how our brains work and getting
 through procrastination. Knowing how the diffuse mode works is HUGE. 
Taking rests are IMPORTANT and I never really thought that it so 
important. I just kind of had a "feeling" overtime. 

This course seriously changed my day-to-day learning. For real.
Truly amazing! I'm really glad I've picked this course. It got me hooked from the get go. Knowledge from this course will definitely help me on my future endeavors, and not just in my area of expertise, but in life generally. Awesome and creative approach on this difficult and puzzling topic of brain works by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, to which I'm eternally grateful. Also, the rest of the staff and wonderful people from additional video materials have a big shout out and were very helpful. They actually helped me greatly to see the bigger picture. A definitive recommendation to everyone. Best of luck to all who participated in creating this awesomeness. Thanks, Aron
Awesome! I find it funny how neither school or college taught us any of this, which essentially ALL humans in this world must know. Learning is something we all do every day and every second and it is my absolute recommendation that every one of you take this course no matter how busy you are in your life. I know it's never too late but I only wish I had known all this during my college days. Dr. Barbara is an absolute beast of a teacher and knows what she's teaching. And it's hard to find teachers who actually KNOW what they are teaching. And so is Dr. Terry.Leave what you are doing for just a week and complete this. It's worth it. 2 - 3 hours a day and you can complete it. Good luck.
I enjoyed going through this well prepared course. I liked the idea of having short videos, instead of long lectures, where the danger is that you loose your concentration. I learned a lot to use for myself but also to teach younger staff. As a matter of fact I am thinking now in ways how to implement this knowledge in any new teaching activity. End of this year I am preparing for a scientific (medical) conference. The difficulty remains in switching from the usual (boring) frontal lectures to a combination of lecture, interrupted by questions and showing some interesting cases. All of this in less than 15 minutes. It is a challenge, which I have to discuss with friends and colleagues.
No words can give this course and instructors what they really deserve. during this course I was surprised with the good advises, materials, interviews and facts that has brought to us. all techniques that I'v learnt her were really very good and have a strong effect in my way of learning. In the future i'll be back ti this course to study it more and more. one time only watching and following it is not enough. I strongly recommend this course to every one. I hope that we will have a series about learning related to this course to clarify  everything related to this path.thanks a lot to instructors, your work was really great, we all appreciate it.thanks to coursera for this course.
It took me way longer than I wanted but I finally completed the course. I had for a long time been interested in improving the way I learn new subjects, specifically abstract ones and was never really satisfied with my performance so I continuously try to find way to improve my process for learning.This course although really light in terms of the complexity of the ideas captures most of the recurring ideas around how to learn better, diffused vs focused mode, spaced repetition, retrieval practice, active learning, how to deal with procrastination, etc. Although I'm a professional procrastinator, I'm also the proof that these techniques work ;) ... even I can finish this course.
How interactive and amazing course is this!!!! i am completely astonish there materials and presentation deliberate process also video edit. It was mind blowing course.This course give me much more than my expectation. why i give 5 star, why not!? if it is possible to rate more than 5 , definitely i give them best. I highly recommend everyone , do not waste your time to learn applying ineffective process. Learn Best tips and technique from this course. I want to mention one of the important point in this course that ,this course's mentor and fellow learner are always active for answering your all questions. And also give thanks to coursera because they make this great platform.
I really enjoyed the course - it was helpful to review the basics of the best ways to learn. The most helpful was the the lecture about procrastination: tips on overcoming the negative feelings when starting learning activity (I realized in fact that it applies also for any other task that one is required to work on) and the expression 'eat your frogs first in the morning' motivates to concentrate on the most 'annoying' tasks first. I appreciate the course structure, length of the videos, and the friendly and casual attitude of the course instructors Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. The complementary optional interviews are also a great source for motivation and inspiration.
I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to better themselves in any way. For people looking to broaden their horizons in a new subject. For people struggling with internal issues, be it anxiety, tension, emotional pain. This course presents you with tools that you need to live a more curious and fulfilling life. You'll hear from experts across all walks of life about how they deal with issues you thought only you dealt with. You'll leave the course with a new inner strength and all sorts of new ideas for your life. I encourage you to explore the optional material and read what interests you. It adds a lot of new dimension to the material, as well as reinforces it.
I saw this course recommended by a commenter on hacker news. It is really an amazing course. Because I've read a lot about the topic previously, most of the ideas were not new to me, but some definitely were, and the presentation just explained everything extremely concisely and linked everything together brilliantly. It had one great idea after another after another, with lots of information packed tightly in a small space (moreso since I watched it at 2x with closed captions). I got a lot out of this and took a bunch of notes, and am eager to try many ideas in practice, especially the ones having to do with procrastination, product/process, and the reward step for habits.
This is a great course which full of information and applicable techniques for daily life. I used to use pomodora for some time but couldn't stick to it as a usual technique helping me to focus. But after taking this course, I changed my mind and I think this is really want I need. I used it for a week and surprisingly, I was more efficient on my work. Also I realized there are so many areas I can improve in terms of time management. It's so hard for me to reach 10 pomodoras per day which is just 5 hours of working time. If I can truly focus for 4 hours/ 8 pomodoras, I think I can have plenty of my own time working on something that I have been trying to do in a long time.
At least on my country, formal training on learning how to learn is often omitted on basic education programs.  However, on higher education it is expected to have this skill already developed.  Learning techniques are then, self discovered or transmitted by word of mouth.  As a result, a mix of myths, fallacies, and actual useful and correct techniques are assimilated.  Habits and attitudes are developed based on those premises.  Some of this habits are positive others plainly negative.Having this course for validating or correcting our own skills and attitudes to learning based on scientifically validated techniques is very valuable. Thanks to the authors for sharing it.
This is the first Coursera course that I have seriously spent time on. Many of the concepts discussed here may seem familiar, as many of us have figured (many of them) out through our own experience with learning. However, the great thing about this course is, it helps to put all those learning tricks together in a place of your brain (form a chunk !) and binds them together with logic and without a doubt makes you a better learner. I would recommend you to revisit the course materials from time to time even after you complete so that you don't forget them over time. Thanks to everyone who helped to put together this course. Special thanks to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski.
Thank you so much for this course! It meant a lot for me to find it in the first place. Now I can effectively improve my way of thinking and more importantly, my life. After I've finally grasped the concept of learning and memory I feel more confident to follow my interests and learn new skills since I have such practical and clear methods! I will highly recommend this course to all my friends and share with them my knowledge and insights. You've really changed my life, now I know - I can achieve anything by practice, consistency, interleaving, and perseverance. And believing in myself of course! Because by changing my thoughts I can change my life. And I definitely will!
With passing this course I finally acquired many useful and interesting tools for better learning especially when, taking to account, currently my studying is in free mode and honestly, it's not the easiest way to keep your attention and be always focusing on subject without necessity of being checked. Now  with gained knowledge I'm able to concentrate on the process (by the way, the process of passing this course was also very enjoyable, thanks to great teachers) of studying and get fun with it even without permanent thinking about product. It's always important to improve your brain tool for efficient process of gathering and richer harvest. Highly recommended to pass!
A YouTuber called call Thomas Frank actually mention this course in his video and I thought I would check it out. From the past 4 weeks, I'm glad I have a broad perspective of learning. Dealing with procrastination with the technique of extreme 25 minute focus. Not much student don't how to actually deal with procrastination and I'm glad I was taught the solution. Especially when reviewing! Doing a mini test when reviewing is the most important then doing a 1 hour study session and taking breaks is also important as well. Thank you Barbara and Terry for teaching me how to learn more effectively. With this knowledge and new skill I can now say I can start senior prepared.
Hello, I highly recommend this course. The teachers, Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski structure their lessons into manageable chunks so that you can make the most out of each video. As well, they explain the material in a way that is easy to understand. I believe that this course will be helpful to you if you are learning, but the most important thing to remember is that no matter how well you do in this course, you will not gain the benefits if you do not practice the important concepts like chunking, focus modes, diffused modes, and the mind palace that help improve and better your learning. This has been Kelechi Osuchukwu and Thank you for learning how to learn.
There are some points in this course that are awkward toward the beginning, yet all of them revolve around the the Dr's seeming to be nervous in front of the camera.  I know I would not do any better☺ I do not say the above to be a jerk, simply to make people aware.  I have recommend this course to many people and each time I do not preface above I get people coming back to make sure they are taking the correct course.  I truly feel this is the most important course anyone can take at any point in their lives.  I have gone through it three times now just for refreshers.  Best course I have ever taken, and best of all it cost me nothing but time. Well worth the exchange.
This course is a very good introduction to the science of the mind and how we can harness it for all it's worth. I'd recommend this course to anyone, especially someone taking an online class for the first time. Don't let the (beautiful) simplicity of the presentation fool you. Engage with what you are being taught in this course and you will never look at learning the same way.I found the module on habits and procrastination /particularly/ interesting.Thank you to all the people who made this course what it is, especially Barbara. I might even take it again some time for a refresher, when I have more time to spend on the forums and extra material provided.Regards,Holly
Every Course in my life I was stress, I knew what will happen I will study hard but not like the other pupils I will fail I will be frustrated,angry, and disappointed, Sometimes I would consider not go to a course even if it will hurt my promotion at work or etc'.. just because I was so afraid of failure.Iv'e learn so many new things and methods I cant wait to my next course or tests to try this new skill.the thing is that I very like to learn new things and to study but would prefer to do it by myself and not in a class but now I'm so happy because I feel like I have the tools to study better, more efficient and to understand why I have always been a mediocre student.
This is a great course for many people. It is easy, flexible and promises to either suggest great tools and methods for learning or at the very least inform you of why the methods you use work as well as they do. This is a great course for both learners and teachers as it can help in structuring learning and teaching sessions to maximise information retention and the likes. Further to that the tools for learning mentioned in this course are great and are backed by relevant research. This is a great course to do and if you're starting with MOOCs I would suggest this as one of the first courses to take. Thanks Barbara, Mr T and the crew. This was an enjoyable experience.
Very valuable, this course is a must.  I now realise as a programmer I was getting myself so stressed because I was using only the focused mode of thinking, I needed to always have one eye on the bigger picture and use the diffused mode of thinking a lot more to make sure my assumptions were correct and I was generally on the correct path. Another big take away for me was chunking and recalling what you've learned.   Also the pomodoro technique to overcome procrastination.  Process over product is one key takeaway, it's better to have a consistent approach rather than have the finished product in mind when you're working on something. Thank you for an amazing course!
Maybe the best lesson of my life, the Mother of all lessons! The one lesson where theory and practice happen simultaneously, as the lesson is also easy to learn (if it was hard to learn it would be self-contradictory, but certainly not! A most user-friendly lesson, and two adorable and excellent professors :) )  Reminded me of: "“Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.” ― Frank Herbert, Dune"
I simply loved this course! It not only made me realize a lot of the 
things I was already incorporating in my studying, but helped me pick 
and sort the effective techniques whilst introducing others. The course 
also features optional interviews which can help get insight into 
learning certain subject areas from renowned experts. I also loved how 
interactive each video is, with a small quiz or short que at the end of 
many of them. Dr. Barbara really knows how to draw the audience’s 
attention and I found myself wanting to learn more at every point. 
Thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for this wonderful course 
on learning how to learn.

Cheers :))
Hi, To everybody who is reading this. I am from India and I take this course during the time of march 2020. I really really enjoy the course material and the content. As a student, You should take this because it will answer your query with reasoning. How much it is important to exercise for learning? How to approach a test? How to handle pre-exam stress and a lot more? Some concept is fresh for me. I bet you you will not waste your time by completing this awesome course. It should be studied in an Indian school. Some point to our Instructors. The course material delivering can be more fun through animation and more example. Lastly, Thanks for learning how to learn
This course was fantastic - well-paced, encouraging, and stimulating! I liked that I could engage at the level that time and other endeavors permitted me, and I had several takeaways that I am already putting to use. I mean, I just used the word einstellung in the context of my work with my boss - it's great! Learning How to Learn is the first MOOC that I ever finished, and it inspired me to pursue other learning opportunities that pique my interest, regardless of their direct correlation to my job, my current skillset and 'innate' abilities. I'm definitely going to stop counting myself due to age or talent - anything is possible if you set yourself up for success!
I found so much helpful advice in this course.  I just wish I had this when course when I went back to school to get my Library Technician Diploma.  I definitely would have benefited from all the tips and techniques given in this course.  For example how to get over the imposter syndrome and procrastination.  I have used the pomodoro method to get over my procrastination.  I also like the interviews with Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent.  They gave my great ideas on how to get over my test taking anxiety.  I have thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble with learning new subjects especially later in life.
This course delivers on what it promises, a clear and concise instruction on how to get better at learning. A lot of these concepts seem like common sense but unfortunately they are not common in practice which should be the goal of all that have taken this course and what they should do in the future. Furthermore, some concepts like the Einstellung effect or the Memory Palace do not seem useful and seem contradictory BUT they are SOO NOT! I used the memory palace technique with my own room and I remembered a really long list of things, I  was amazed. What we need is humility and curiosity when viewing this course and apply these techniques without shame or doubt!
I haven't written a review for a product/service good or bad in around 8 years cause of my ADHD, but  this course is so important that I have to go through temporary pain to tell you guys this. take this course. It will change everything. Just make sure you write down everything you learn and study it. That's the most important tip. Every week is just as important as the first. You will regret not sticking through the entire course. It even gives you some important life advice. Anyone is capable of achieving what they want, and this course will show you why and how. This course is the type of stuff you learn and say "Dang, I can't wait to pass this on to my kids."
It is a good idea to go through this course before other topicsComing back to the material and continuing can be tough sometimes but it's worth the effort because the concepts can help in other areas as well (such as handling complex tasks) The quizzes can cause some anxiety (it's a test...) but the questions selected and the way the answers are written will help fixing the most important ideas so they are very helpful in the end, also proving one of the concepts (that self tests are great for learning)I felt the need to go over some parts of the material several times (using the notes) which means that times allocated for the course did not match the estimations.
I wish I have taken this course when 30 years ago when I have so much difficulties in learning. It provided valuable insights to how to learn anything, and even go as far as your daily habit, your mental health and physical health, all of those are linked! You can't study well without a good mental health and physical condition, and this course give advice on how to achieve all those requirements. As I have already read Mind for numbers, this course reinforced and retain my knowledge gain, and in addition, it provided extra reading material, exercise and most important of all, the forums and social page for interaction which you can't get just by reading the book.
I finished university long time ago and although I am a curious person who is always reading, and informally learning about a wide variety of topics, I am considering going back to study more formally and that is why i took the course.I have found it very well structured, starting with the basics of how our brains work to slowly deepen into different aspects of learning, as well as practical tips and techniques that are applicable not only for academic studies but also for daily life. Even the way the course is constantly testing is a great way to practice the theory.The instructors are clearly very knowledgeable and Dr. Oakley makes the videos quite entertaining.
I joined Cousera a few months ago focused on improving my knowledge bank. I wanted to brush up on things I memorized in college before graduating in preparation for the corporate world. I feel so lucky that this was my first course. I now have a better reason to keep learning, in and out of cousera. LH2L is a revolutionary work of art that will change the life of anybody who remains disciplined enough to go through the whole course. It teaches techniques and practices that you wish you knew before attending any school. Especially higher learning. The methods, which I ended up using in the course itself are 100% effective, you just have to trust it. Happy learning.
This was first MOOC I have taken because I read about it in a NY Times review. It was an excellent course and well laid out. This course should be taken by everyone; from high school students to anyone in their career wanting to sharpen their ability to learn in a rapidly changing environment.  It gives you good logic for how the brain learns, sound tools to use immediately and confidence that you can master new material or refresh old concepts. I also like how the instructors went back and forth between the practical application and delved into the scientific structure and inner workings of the brain so it reinforced why the learning concepts will actually work.
Really liked this class. Teachers are excellent in the way built the videos and learning material. They really master their subject and make it very accessible to anyone to understand. Content is not complicated and extremely useful concept in every day life. Wish I had this class and understood best how the brain learn better and more effectively before spending so many years in the education system wasting precious hours with the wrong techniques! Human are gifted by having such a incredible ability to learn, it would be a waste to not learn who to use our cognitive and learning abilities to its greatest potential.Thank you very much Barbara and Terrence,Pascal
I have done 5 courses here and I consider this course the best of all. I loved the way they taught with funny examples that are easy to understand and help us to remember better what we learnt. This course doesn't puts any pressure on students of assignment and the tests are also designed in a way that helps the people go recall what was taught and by doing this we are able to retain what was taught to us. The words ,examples, stories, researches and  many more things made it even better to understand the terms . Even the optional videos were every informative and one should definitely see them.  I respect the teachers for their efforts for this valuable course.
The course tells about two different "modes" of mind work: focused and diffuse, 
and what each of them is for. It also gives practical advises about how 
to deal with procrastination, how to remember new material and how to 
prepare for tests.
The course is amazing. Information is divided into small 
well-formed chunks. Video lectures are not longer than 7 minutes, so you I was not get tired while watching them. Dr. Oakley's lectures are so 
clear and easy to understand even for non-English speakers, like me.
I would like to thank Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for their efforts.Definitely recommend everyone to take this course regardless of the area of studying.
When I started this course I was very curious to know how, an On Line Course should have been of help for my learning projects.Not only I found it really interesting, but after the very first videos I decided to stop any other learning activity, waiting to get to the end of the course in order to be more effective and not waste time with all other courses.I so much appreciate the arguments, that I strongly recommend the course not only to students, but also to teachers (whatever their subject or level). Putting into practice all the information discussed within the course, should be useful to "guide" students and to help them to grow up avoiding false believes.
this course is fantastic! while it all might sound familiar, it gave me fantastic tools how to retain what i learn instead of making a soup out of my brain by studying without results. I learned the importance of stopping and taking a break when a problem doesn't get resolved after 20+ minutes, the importance of exercise, sleep or simply a brake to unleash the more creative, diffuse working mind, to always start tackling bigger problems during tests first but let go and do smaller if after a certain time i didnt succeed. the importance of Recall and continuos Testing yourself and the importance of regular practice. Thank you professors, it was time well spent!
I'm very grateful for this course Learning how to learn to Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski and Coursera platform. I spend 4 productive weeks studying the main rules and principles of learning during isolation. That knowledge and skills will definitely help me in my future life and career. Also I've been seriously thinking to become of a master of this course to adapt it for middle school students in Russia. I think these skills will be  truly supportive for those who has difficulties in learning, memorization, chunking, for those who being stressed during the exams and passing the tests, for those who doubts in their own abilities, potential and talents.
I always feel exhausted and reluctant to study or learn new things because my  previous learning style was ineffective! This course tell you how to learn effectively and efficiently,  with a relax way, easy to understand (even if your english is not good like me), and appliable in any fields . The coaches, Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence delivered their lectures as if they were talking to you directly and knew what are your problems during learning, why you have these and how to solve these problems. Each lesson will ask your feedback and I suggest you to fill it. I am really recommend this course to every one, no matter what or who you are, and how old you are!
You will definitely take with you a lasting impression on how your brain works along with how to treat it so that you could learn more faster. Getting rid of old habits and incorporating the new habits will take some time and practice. The instructors a great and the interviews with those that desire to learn an abundance of information and sharing their experience with you is very inspiring! Thank you all for allowing me to improve my views on learning and the opportunity of taking a course this rich with content on how to better my thinking power. You all are great, God Bless! Keep up the work for us and I definitely look forward to contributing one day....
This course is excellent and is highly recommended to anyone who would like to enrich their learning experience and take the learning results to a great level. The underlying concepts (e.g. focused vs diffused modes of thinking) and techniques (e.g. chunking and the Pomodoro) introduced in this course are particularly useful in boosting our productivity and ultimately show us a scientifically-proven and effective way of learning (and test-taking). Self-education is a lifelong work in progress, so by being able to learn effectively, a wide range of knowledge and possibilities await us. Explore the course content now and set your timer for dedicated learning!
I was introduced to this course at a time when I was struggling to retain and apply what I learnt. And after this course, I can say that I have more effective methods to tackle those problems and be more productive than before. The course not only teaches about how to learn effectively but also makes one aware of the illusions of learning and the incorrect methods. In addition to
the course material, it also has bonus videos in which the best people share
their techniques and how they do it.I would like to thank Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for this truly wonderful course. It has taught me something that it is to be remembered for a lifetime.
I just love how the course's instructors, Mrs. Barbara Oakley and Mr. Terrence Sejnowsky, made it easier for learners to relate their learning difficulties in the examples and concepts explained. These include the concept of the two thinking modes (focused and diffused), our inner zombies (habits), willpower, procrastination, and some effective learning techniques. I just love how it gives a breath of fresh air among the ones I always see online. It was so technical yet highly creative.I would really, really love the idea that a day would come that I could get to meet these two individuals. :) I've always aspired to meet prominent yet fun scientists. Kudos!
I have learnt so much about my body and mind from this course. From chunking materials, to how to answer tests and also the importance of incorporating exercise into your study routine. It was such a fascinating course and it took me a brief period to finish it. After completing it, I definitely have that much needed motivation to go through difficult concepts, projects and overall to be excited about my masters journey. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of a rut, who feels anxious in subjects, who can't focus even in study environment, who finds it difficult to grasp certain subjects/ topics. This course would be perfect for you. Good luck!
This course is great! If you listen to the advice from this course, take notes and actively implementing this advice as you go along, it will become much easier for you to notice results very quickly!  This course has helped me change my mindset towards learning and studying - I noticed my old ways weren't working as well for me, and learning this course helped me not only becoming aware of the techniques one can use to master their leaning, but also allowing me with a plethora of different learning methods to experiment with and see which one works for me. I highly recommend this course if you want to continue to learn in life, and get ahead much faster.
Thank you so much for your course! I realize this is a useful closeness course, it was made to be easy to understand and follow and many interesting article to find out more. Clearly I think the knowledge was transmitted very scientifically with condensed knowledge, reasonable progress. I through this course with excited mood, from the principles of chunking to help me learn better to the video you running when you encounter the difficult in study - exercise is very important in learning. It's encourage me, give me more motivations and feel more confident when I think I knew more about the mechanisms in study. I think it's a basic course for every courses
Much appreciation and warmest congratulations to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski.  The information presented in Learning How to Learn was very engaging and presented in an accessible way.  Although I am an already-experienced learner, I gleaned many useful techniques, many of which I've already incorporated into daily life.  I took this course in conjunction with my home-schooled seventh grader and we both found ourselves sharing some of the most interesting bits of the course material with others.  The broad applicability of the course materials and the engaging style of the presenters make this class a must-take.  Mahalo nui, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
This course is excellent! I wish I had learned this when I was in school. It helps a lot that most of the techniques taught in the course are easy to understand and can be applied quickly. I love how Dr Oakley explains the techniques so simply and making the course enjoyable, and how Dr Sejnowski explains deep scientific concepts about the human brain in an easily understandable manner. I would recommend this course to just about anyone - after all we are all learning everyday! I believe the skills acquired here will help us to learn effectively, even at work, and is one of the most powerful skills we can ever have. Thank you Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski!
Hello Guys.I had a very good time learning this course with our two carrying professor. They were really cute, and give us the motivation and the will to move on further into this course. They make things so much easier with their very well detailed vidéo, and they have a gift for teaching. They put a lot of time and effort into this course, and I'm so grateful for that, I learn so much with you, thanks for everything, and to thank you furthermore, I, myself, will teach it to my close family, and then my close friend, and maybe the public after that.Thanks for everything, you gave us a wonderful gift, maybe the greatest gift of all time .. knowledge.
This course is short and useful, providing students with many potential tactics to incorporate into their learning strategies.  Some will be familiar and some won't, but it's a nice refresher either way.  My complaints center around the brevity of each topic and also the amount of gimmies in each quiz/test.  While the prior is understandable (and remedied by a ton of supplemental reading suggestions), the soft toss quiz question get old.  Things like "As stated in the video, performing the Macarena while stabbing yourself with a spork is a scientifically proven method to efficiently chunk data" are humorous but kind of cheapen the quizzes and tests.
A really good course which provides tips and insights on how to learn more efficiently. A guide which helps me to pinpoint the root cause of the struggle that I am facing for years in my musical journey. After completing this course, I had a better idea of how to help myself learn, so that I can improve for the better in the area of music. I do recommend everyone to take this course, as I believe that regardless of your age, experiences in life, there is something that you would be able to take away from this course. Even if you know the stuff that is taught in this course, it serves as a really good reminder and motivate you to learn more in life.
I genuinely thinks that this course is a most have for everybody, especially students (the can make the most of out it and use those practical methods immediately).The instructors of this course make the material clear and laughable, I had great time learning how to learn. There is a whole community behind this course - which was unexpected and welcoming. That the first time I see something like it on Online-Courses and I don't think there are many other communities out there.I highly recommend it.I wish to thank to everyone who helped to make this course come alive, you're managed to make an impact on my everyday life, and I'm sure on many others.
Excellent course. Something like this course - basically, psychology of learning with a focus towards useful applications - should be required of all incoming freshmen at ever college. I definitely wish I had taken something like it at the beginning of my college career. There is only one thing I'd suggest to improve the course further: The male professor is obviously very uncomfortable on camera, which made me feel uncomfortable also. I'd suggest considering re-filming some of his videos after a few more practice rounds so he comes off as more relaxed and comfortable. This is nit-picky, but it did make me want to skip some of his videos at times.
This course gives you the tools you will wish you had long ago. It will help you understand the way your brain works and work with it, not against it. You'll learn new way to study, use different thinking modes, and use sleep to solidify the material you're learning. The professor uses simple mnemonic's and a lot of visual aides which make it easy to understand and remember the concepts (which in and of itself is a lesson on how to absorb materiel).She's is very personable and cool, and for me personally, struggling to enter college at 26 for the first time, hearing her say she was my age when she started and is now an engineer was very inspiring!
It was a bittersweet experience. First of all, because now I feel not only a bunch of positive emotions — satisfaction, confidence, excitement for future learning endeavors, etc — but also deep regret. I regret that I have learned all of this only now, when I'm nearly 25, and not in school, where all this stuff should be taught. It could have prevented so much failure and suffering...Then again, as the old saying goes, there's time for everything. I'll still make the most out of this new knowledge and whatever time I have left. Sincerest appreciations to those who created this course. It was an amazing job, really. Keep it up. The world needs it.
Thank you Barbara and Terrence! Because I have a lot of time on my hands, it took me some time to complete this course but it was certainly a great learning that I have no doubt that it will change my life completely. Now is the time to start a new stage in my life and no doubt thank you both. You are the most wholesome teachers I've had for now! And now I feel entitled to teach what I've learned in this course with other people that had before the same problems as me and others that took this course and I cannot recommend enough how useful the material in this course is. Thank you very much and thanks for teaching me for Learning how to Learn!
My best Coursera course so far - and probably one of the best courses I took ever. The information was really new to me (e.g. the greatest enemy to learning is procrastination - in German: "Aufschieberitis", or "start hard jumpy easy"). it was presented in a funny and easy to grasp way (I loved the zombies and the little private photos and videos from Dr. Oakley). It was extremly helpful (e.g. Anki and the Pomodoro method).As a mother of two teenage boys I am happy to pass on what I learned to my kids.This is a valuable and fun course. And after the course they keep you informed with regular e-mails on the topic.Thank you, thank you, thank you!
This course offered me a deep view into the world of learning - now I understand much better what I have to do in order to achieve greatest accomplishments in my academical career. I may not agree with some of the techniques they mention, and I may had already known some of them from before. However, I feel that its scientific perspective and its wise advices are very valuable for anyone who is attempting to improve their academical performance in any subject.Finally, I really appreciate the efforts of P.Oakley and P.Sejnowski  - and their team - for bringing us this fantastic and potentially life-changing course for free. Thank you very much.
The best class I took over my 30 years of learning.  Initially, I did not think much of the course.  But I was intrigued that it was so popular.  I am glad i did jump in and stay.  It has improved my learning ever since.  Understanding how learning is conducted 'under the hood' allows me to explore techniques i overlooked and reinforce habits I already have.  Thank you for two excellent teachers.  Th  I challenge Coursera to elevate this course to highest level of visibility.  Rather than waiting for serendipity, more learners of the world should have common awareness of this brilliant class.    Thank you for the opportunity to express myself
loved the simple progression of the course contents. The teaching style was quite simple and easy to follow... This course is suitable to be given in the first semester of every university education so students who have the intention to learn but have certain mind blocs or lack proper orientation on how to learn come out of that.Also the examples and interviews were very interesting and related to the subject matter. The usage of visuals and practice tests were intelligently placed which supported recall.I thank Professor Barbara Oakley and Professor Terrence Sejnowski for putting this together and help me make change in the way I can learn.
This course demonstrates some tips and techniques for learning, that you never knew. Implementing the ideas from this course will improve your learning at least 2x. One of the best things I learned from this course is that, REAL learning takes time. Don't expect from yourself to read something and remember it forever. To develop long term memory, we need spaced repetition, we need to keep our focus away from material so our mind can enter into diffused mode and do it's work in background. Metaphors are really helpful in memorising things. All these things are backed by neuroscience research. Give yourself a treat by opting in to this course.
Wow !!  " Learning How to Learn  " was a wonderful journey for me ,taking myself into different concepts of learning methods .I sincerely thank the whole team for their effort to share and guide us in learning and memorizing the facts.We also  realized what are our procrastination's , weakness in our learning experience.The videos  were mind blowing  and all the anatomical concepts were taught using metaphor and analogy,which will help us retain ideas in our mind . Thanks for providing interview sessions with some of the brilliant personality and sharing their experience.I truly recommend others to choose this course and its worth learning.
Hello Instructors,This course was wonderful. It has been a long time since I attended school or any kind of formal education. This course taught me things that I never learned in school but, wish I had. Important topics included how the brain functions when learning, why we procrastinate and how to prevent it, as well as the importance of recalling material through spaced repetition and deliberate practice. As someone who wants to continue learning and assist my family with learning this course introduced ideas that I will use daily and pass on to my children. Thank you so much for taking the time to produce this course. Best wishes, Joe P.
I really enjoyed taking this course. The course content was very engaging. Dr. Oakley's delivery was very lively and kept me thoroughly interested in the lectures. I also learned a lot from the optional interviews, particularly the ones related to language learning, memory, and the humanities. I am confident that I will be able to apply the lessons in this course not just for learning better but also for leading a more productive life in general. This course has taught me how I can adopt a learning attitude in anything I do and engage more fruitfully with whatever I do. I am sure I will keep revisiting portions of this course in the future.
The course allowed me a great reflection on how I have been learning what I want to learn. Such reflection, accompanied by new studies on the functioning of the brain, has made me change my study habits, for example, in language studies (English and French) and music, facilitating better memorization and understanding of languages. You, Dr Barbara and Dr Terence, are to be congratulated for the excellent didactics and simplicity in teaching a very complex subject, for the selected texts and the interviews that stimulated me a lot in the conduct of my daily life. Congratulations to the Coursera team for having provided this course. Thankful!
My middle-aged eyes have been opened, thank you. I have often thought myself academically inadequate by having failed most of my school life, particularly panicking on tests, but this course has shown me, as well as the concept of Divergent Thinking, that I simply never had the tools to use my brain and body more effectively. These techniques and the knowledge should be taught to children and up, not later in life (I am aiming this at schools in general). At one point during this course I cried, because I was made to feel not a failure, but a person with the potential and ability to succeed if I simply change my attitude. Thank you so much.
In my little experience of MOOCs, one of the best I've come across.The great things about this course is that it unlocks 'keys' that will help you in learning any topics and in life in general. I think that's one more reason why it ranks among the best.The use of videos, reading materials and other activities is well 'balanced'.There is also a great use of metaphors and illustrations. Emphasis is on making things simple and accessible, without 'dumbing down'.I'd recommend this course to anyone. I have actually recommended the Spanish and French version to 2 people close to me; as it will be accessible to them in a language they understand.
As someone who has only ever know subpar public schooling, poor parental involvement during formative years, and the old cram, regurgitate, repeat, study strategy, I cannot stress the amount of change in my educational paradigm that has blossomed forth because of this course. Learning everything I should have known all along including study habits, tips for procrastination, and learning how my own mind works are only a few of the tools that I will use for the rest of my life. I preach the Coursera word whenever I get the chance evangelizing anyone who will listen, and have nothing but appreciation for the entire Learning How to Learn team.
What a truly wonderful course about learning. Barbara and the rest of the presenters are fantastic. The course gathers together some of the most knowledgeable minds in the world to help explain how to improve the way you learn. The course is backed up by scientific studies and exudes quality in every way. I've learnt more about learning how to learn in this short course than i have in my entire life to date, if only this had been taught during my early education. I am already work out how I can teach the concepts and techniques to my young children so they will have  these amazing skills when they start their education. Thank you so much.
The best course ever! Really helpful and easy to understand. I highly recommend it for all people who want to understand how their brain works and how to make their study efforts more efficient. The course is also really useful not only for studying but in career - here is a lot of tips&tricks which help in everyday life and work. To my mind the best is not only to take this course but also read books by Barbara Oakley and watch the second course Mindshift on Coursera. Part of material would be the same but that is even for good - you constantly repeat the most important parts of knowledge and at the same time get a lot of extra material.
This is a great course for everyone, I am a 28 year old Industrial and Systems Engineer about to start an MBA program in one of the most recognized Universities in Europe, and I am sure the tips and tricks taught in this course by Barbara and Terry will be of great help for this new endevour and the rest of my life without a doubt. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to keep learning anything the rest of their lives!  This should be the very first thing teachers teach in school! I´ve been learning wrong all of my life. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and keep up  the good work! Best Regards.                               JCC
Hello Readers,This is really a Master Class Piece ...."A work with great precision and perfectly executed. This is so much insightful that i recommend this for all, specially the people who wants to know enjoy learning.I really want to thanks each and everyone, who is associated in making this, from the bottom of my heart for being there, with small words i can say that "YOU CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY THE PROCESS GIVEN IN THE COURSE AND ONCE YOU DEVELOP THE HABIT OF ENJOYING THE PROCESS, THERE WILL NOT BE ANY PRODUCT OR SUBJECT YOU CANNOT MASTER ........HAPPY LEARNING !Thankyou once again !!!Always Grateful / Himanshu
It is a good course. Highly recommended for High-school and college students for sure. However, you can take the course at any point in your life and benefit from the learning tips and insights. I had known some of the techniques before through other books and resources I had read in my school years, but it was nice to find all the information packaged so neatly and consume it in an organized fashion. It helps to remember the materials and apply it. And ofcourse there were many more new insights and sources of inspiration from the course. This is knowledge that you can then pass on to your family, friends and colleagues. Happy learning!
Thank you Terrence and Barbara! Your course was so enjoyable that I passed it in less than 3 days. That's how good it is.As the English say: "The more you study, the more you know. The more you know, the more you forget. The more you forget, the less you know. So why study?"Your course helpes to overcome this vicious practice by using focused & diffused thinking, chunking, mnemonics, tests technique. I'll use them for passing Google AdWords exam.I am convinced that real democracy starts when you start to learn and apply your knowledge into practice for the sake of future generations. Thanks for all!Nikolay Kochnev, from Russia with love
This course makes me opened my mind about how we really learn and make me realize how wrong I was about the techniques I was using to study, that only helped my at the moment for the exam but not to understand and remember in a long term way. I thank you because not only you helped us with teaching how we learn but also you taught us tips that will help us in daily life like how to manage stress, how to avoid procrastination (so difficult now a days) and how our thoughts can helps us in our learning.Thanks to the teachers for teaching us your knowledge and also to make us believe in ourselves that we can achieve everything that we want
I am at the stage where I have to take many exams that will determine my career for the future, and that will enable me to be where I want to be. I am so grateful for finding this course just in time. It has helped me learn so much about learning. I have never learned about so many learning tips in my life, and I am sure that these tips that the course offers will change my life forever, and will hopefully help me fulfill my dreams. To tell you the truth, I am already seeing a huge improvement in my understanding of the subjects I'm taking and I was able to do my tests well. With all honesty, I highly recommend this course. Thank you.
I have just finished the Massive Open Online Course entitled “Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects”. I think this course is the quintessence of a good course: it is interesting, well-illustrated, and transmits with passion by Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. I truly recommend it to everyone as this subject concerns everybody. It really is an eye-opening course. I think I will go back to it in the future as some of the concepts I learned are really relevant for me (the Pomodoro, the Impostor Syndrome, the Hard start – Jump to easy technic, the concentration on process rather than product …).
This is a fantastic course. It really helped my understand how we learn and how to become a better learner. It combines facts about the brain with our daily life which makes the information not only interesting but also highly relevant . Questions at the end of the videos are a great tool to make sure you were actually paying attention. during the video.Barbara Oakley is a splendid coach and made  this course a memorable experience for me and Terry Sejnowski helped me understand science  simply without over simplifying it. :)Kudos to the entire team of Learning How To Learn !Cheers!p.s. Thank you Coursera for offering such courses. :)
Initially I started taking this course to keep my mind stimulated during the COVID-19 stay at home order.  Soon I realized how valuable it was for not only any future courses I take, but also for training and learning new things at home and in my job.  Or learning old things better!  This course is very relatable.  It was enlightening; it helped me discovery some of my own weaknesses and potential ways to correct and strengthen. I intend to recommend it to friends and family with school-age children.  I believe if a parent understood this information, they could better relate and assist their children.   Loved it!Thank you very much!
This was my first Coursera course and it has been absolutely brilliant!  Thanks Dr Barbara Oakley for putting this together because you have outlined so many practical tips for optimizing learning.  On top of that, I really appreciated the interviews you did with different people on the subject - sharing their personal experiences in learning.  You even addressed many of the challenges people normally face and demystified it all - Einstellung and Imposter Syndrome for example.   You delved into a essential topic and made it so accessible - an indispensable start to learning anything else!  I wish I knew all this when I was at school!
This course is the foundation to success in all you do! I can't praise these instructors enough for the time they spent in laying out the groundwork so clearly and efficiently. For those of us with ADHD, it's a life changing discovery of skills. Years of feeling like our brain is "broken" and doesn't function like others that are "normal" can be embarrassing and defeating to say the least. For those of you that want to simply improve your study habits and retain more, deeply... this is the course for you. Simple, effective and practical... This course was a delight! I highly recommend it, no matter your IQ, skill level or profession.
I was a first-generation college student back in 1990.  I was intelligent, hard working, and had excellent grades in high school.  But I was totally lost in college.  I didn't know how to spend my time efficiently to maximize my learning potential.  My method was to just carve out a block of time at night to sit down and brute force my way through engineering homework.  That was the hard way to do it... this course will introduce the correct way to tackle tough courses.  The subject material is not difficult at all; putting it all into practice may take some un-learning and effort, but you will certainly see benefits in the long run.
I've generally been a good student for most of my life but I was interested in what this course had to offer. I was very pleased with the subject matter and it helped me really figure out how I could learn new and challenging concepts more effectively, as well as why I had trouble with certain subjects going through college. I really wish I had this knowledge when slogging through math and chem classes for my undergraduate studies! The instructors are very personable, professional, and knowledgeable. I think that anybody can benefit when learning how to learn, and I cannot wait to apply these techniques and new insights to my life.
Thank you so much for teaching us this important lesson in my life! Truly inspiring, and useful. I found it drastically improve my effectiveness in my studying. I used to lose confidence in my science subjects, thinking I am just lacking the so-called "math/science talent", but I found out from this course that it's actually the problem of my methods! Now I am implementing the methods I have learnt from this course, and improve my grades dramatically. Now I am recommending this course to my friends who are struggling with their studies, helping them with what I have learnt.and I believe this will help! After all, thank you so much!
I found this course extremely helpful in doing exactly what it proposes to do. It breaks down ideas on how to study more efficiently, as well as focusing on retention. I especially enjoyed the week focusing on procrastination, as I have a hard time with that to point debilitation at times. This course has helped me to view things I would ordinarily avoid and I now try to make them a challenge or a goal to overcome. The course did not take so much time either, there is no reason you could not fit this into your schedule. I definitely recommend this course to strangers and I have already suggested it to my friends and family as well.
Absolutely phenomenal.  This course should be required for an person who owns a human brain.  Dr.'s Oakley and Segnowski have given the world a great gift in this course.  The theory resonated with my personal experience over the years and really helped me connect the dots around how my mind works.  I was able to apply the practical suggestions immediately (and in fact while taking the course to the course itself!) This tools I've learned in this course have helped me become more productive in my work and home life and even beyond that I've been able to use what I've learned to help my kids with their schoolwork.  Wonderful stuff.
Huge thank you to Dr. Barb Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for this invaluable gift. I wish I had been taught how to learn before starting school, instead of stumbling blindly through by using my own methods (though it turns out many of them correspond with the concepts of this course). Dr. Oakley - this course is now in my memory palace associated with an image of you holding the octopus of attention in one hand and a flying mule in the other, all three perched atop my window sill and no taller than 4 inches :)I promise to teach as many of the concepts I've learned here to people around me who need to know them.Thank you so much!
I'm doing a PhD on Physics and Astronomy in prestigious university in UK, so one would think I have mastered learning. Nothing would be farther from true, I spent many years in the usual way of learning, which did not leave me with deep knowledge, it was just for the tests. This course have showed me the right tools for really learning, it has brought to my attention several key aspects I inadvertently dismissed when study previous degrees. More importantly it proved me that no matter how old you are, or how far you have advanced in higher education and academia you can still learn how to be better at learning! Fantastic course!!
Phenomenal course content delivered in fun, easily digestible chunks. I loved the references to the latest neuroscience and the stories of hard work and perseverance that led to success, like Santiago Ramon y Cajal. The bonus/extra reading was really helpful and entertaining as well (especially about writing and languages). It was a real pleasure to have taken this course, my first with Coursera. I wish I'd known this stuff 15 years ago when I was in university... I fell into the trap of re-reading as a learning technique. I'm telling everyone I know about Learning How to Learn, particularly those who are currently in university.
The course on learning to learn was immensely helpful.  The content presented here was non-trivial, insightful, original and very well presented.  I used some of the new techniques that I learned in this course to master the course material itself and also had an easier time completing the final test.  I am very confident that the techniques that I've learned from Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski will help me become a better student and a software engineer.  I would love to be associated with this team and learn about newer research and developments that can help me get more out of life, perhaps a "Learning How to learn - Part 2" ?
I encourage everyone to take this course! The teachers and instructors are amazing, the content is really useful, especially if you are in school, college or just learning in general. Learning How To Learn changed my way of approaching different subjects, by showing study techniques and tips to use in exams and tests that are  effective. The neuroscience content also really helped me to understand how the brain works and show me important daily habits that i can bring to my life to help strengthed my mind and take better care of my wellbeing. A huge thank you for everyone involve in this MOOC! Congratulations for the good work!
It is really a fantastic course, which I am more than willing to introduce to my families and friends. I have applied some of the techniques I have learned from the course, and they are useful and effective. It also debunks some myths regarding learing. But what I think is the most important is that it have changed my mindset. It alters my conception of learning, and even of other things in my life. I feel lucky having a chance to take this course. And Now I am taking another course of Barb andTerry (Yes, it's Mindshift! ). It's glad to see them again, and to learn something new that will also have a profound impact on my life.
I really wish that I had the chance to take this class while i was in college or before I went to college. I was such a dumb that I didn't have these great techniques and I just wasted my 3 year college life. When I recall my college life, I just didn't learn much. I just went for the exams. It's pathetic honestly; however, now I have learned the GREAT tools from this class that I am going to teach all to my brother who is a sophomore in college now, and learning never ends that I can apply all the tools into my life long learning.  Thanks a lot for offering such an incredible class for free. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND  THIS CLASS.
When I started this course I was eager to learn and grow, I was already familiar with the pomodoro technique and I did use it some time ago but for some reason I lost the habit. Understanding why it works, along with other concepts such as chunking, the zombie mode, procrastination, the focused and diffuse mode of learning/concentrating is so interesting and eye opening. What I learned through this 4 weeks I will take it with me forever and I'll share this knowledge with everyone I can, It's a must! I'm happy that I was part of this journey, thank you dr. Barbara and Terrence for this class and god bless you. Namaste everyone!
Wow, this course.There is so much of information online, so many videos, apps, articles on "How to improve your learning skill?". Like most of the people, I have read a lot about it, indeed. They all had little effect on me. It was all random.Trust me and take this course. It is an organized learning platform and will for sure help. I'm no extraordinary person but I already feel the better change in me. This course has given me a whole new perspective on learning. I got to know my past mistakes. I have changed my way of learning new things for good, to effective and efficient ways. Huge thanks to the whole team of this course!
I really liked the course, it was very interesting to find out how the process of learning work and why it is important to review information. When I ma learning something new on the internet i just want to go to the next step of the course or training to finish it fast and i never wanted to go back to the part that i already passed. It was like: " yee i have done the assignments and passed the test, so i don t have to go back". But now i understand i have been a little stupid in my approach and reviewing things i have learned is good thing and not counterproductive. Thank you for your teaching it was great experience for me .
Learning How to Learn is an excellent class for individuals wanting to polish their rusty learning skills, and expand their learning tool-kits. I especially enjoyed learning about new ways to learn, how other people learn, the common struggles many of us experience, and the latest in research on learning. The tools, suggestions, and topics have already helped me expand my Chunked Mental Library. Useful resources were also provided; I purchased the book Fluent in 3 Months by Benny Lewis and signed up for the Publicationcoach.com.  I can't wait to dive into these resources. Thank you for a fantastic course.  Julia, Carlsbad, CA.
It changes my mind about learning, long term before I encountered this course, I knew it must be something wrong in my learning method which conduct a very ineffective learning-product. This neuroscientific based course enlightens me in scientific learning and makes me start to think seriously about how to learn more effectively. It's really a great honor to encountered this course, and I'm sure it would be one of the most powerful asset I ever had in my lifetime. My sincere gratitude to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, How to Learn Team and all the interviewees invited. Thank you for all your great insights on me.
It's a fantastic course. It has shed light on all the learning problems i have been facing in my career. My career needs me to keep updating myself. But I lost track over a period of time. Things I need to learn accumulated over a period of time and when I looked at them it was overwhelming.  That's when I started taking this course. It has highlighted all the mistakes I have been doing learning and gave me tools address them .Thank you so much Professors.  For other learners like me, a piece of advice: Watch the optional interviews given in the course. They are real eye openers. You get to hear a lots of stuff from legends.
This course is great. I'd say I became an evangelist of this course. I told about it to lots of my co-workers and I already feel I'm getting better at learning.One of the main issues I always suffered with was "cramming everything on 1 day". I still believe I did the same during this course. But now, at least, I recalled the material from time to time in various places, explained it to my co-workers, listened to summary videos from time to time and testedmemorizing various stuff using memory palace technique.This is a great course! Barbara & Terrence, thanks a lot!Best wishes & thanks for learning how to learn!Ostap Andrusiv
I have been struggling with reading, and the more I read the better I have become at reading. Problem solving has improved greatly! I am 67 years young, and look forward to new challenges everyday!My hobbies include Photography, tinkering with devices [fixing them] also gardening, if it does not grow this year try next year! I consider failures as successes as long as I learned from the experience.My deep appreciation goes out to Barbara Oakley [I am also a veteran US Navy I crossed the Pacific and Indian oceans] so I also have a deep respect for all the people who have taken this course no mater where they live and reside!
This course has been a wonderful resource about learning and I feel it has equipped me with many efficient tools of learning such as The Pomodoro technique, the importance of sleep, the importance of subconscious mind and the diffused mode of thinking and various ways of grasping the material and retaining it in our long term memory such as recall, testing, and spaced repetition and all of this has only made me a better learner. So I am really grateful to Coursera for giving us the opportunity to learn, and to our instructors, Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for dedicating their time and compiling such an amazing course.
This class is wonderful!  I learned so many different things about the brain, thinking, memory, tools, tips for more efficient studying, and the list goes on.  This is the first step in my journey, and I will take all that I've learned here and apply it not only in my future studies, but my daily life as well.  Thank you Coursera for offering such wonderful opportunities for people to gain knowledge and understanding on many levels.  And finally, ( the best for last ) Thank you so much to the fantastic professors for making it fun and funny at times, for all the wonderful tools and for the opportunity to Learn how to Learn.
I came into this course skeptical and worried that it would be a waste of time. That it would be geared too much for young adults. But the information presented (and presented well) was very informative and useful even for more mature lifelong learners. Both me and my amazing girlfriend took this course together and  will surely take the lessons with us and use them to learn more efficiently in our lives! Thank you very much to the professors. What I really appreciated were the sources at the end of every video. I'm the kind of person who actually goes through them and sees if there's anything that could pique my interest.
This course is very informative and insightful. There are so many useful hints and tricks that, even though very small and almost insignificant, have made a huge impact on my ability to learn new things, and how proficient I am at learning them. Understanding what's happing "under the hood" helped rid me of the guesswork that's associated with learning new things - that is, it gave me a tool that I'd been trying to find within myself for many years. The video-nature of this course, and the informative visuals helped to make the experience interesting, inviting, and stress-free. I plan on recommending it to all my friends.
Simply: this is the single best and most important course of learning I have ever done.Not only has it inspired and uplifted me, it has given me real and concrete methods and techniques for becoming a much better student (of life!). For all people of all ages, backgrounds and interests I tell you: take the opportunity to do this course and you will not look back.I wish I had this course when I started university; it should be compulsory material for learners and students everywhere. In short, this course is OUTSTANDING.I want to thank Barbara Oakley in particular for teaching me how to be a much more capable human being.
This is a course that is truly about learning which applicable and practical knowledge and techniques are taught. Each video have visual aids and analogies with some comedy added in that helps to retain information. Questions at the end of the videos test your understanding on the lectures and a summary at the end of each week is useful in recalling and retaining information. I feel that most presentations and lessons taught in school can definitely learnt from this course in teaching more effectively. The tremendous efforts put into interviewing successful people in different careers and hearing tips are very enriching.
The course has been life changing for me. I'm familiar with the latest theories on learning/teaching, and was chose as a semifinalist for the Community College Teacher of the Year for North Carolina (not to brag, but I do have come credentials in teaching).  This course is by far the best way to learn how to learn. Both structure and content are so very well thought out that there's no room for improvement.The sections on procrastination, Einstellung, and the Pomodoro technique have been life-changing for me. I am much more productive as a result. Kudos to the Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski, and many many thanks.
It is a very well structured course, and of immense practical value. Although I completed my formal education long long ago ( I am a retired person), I decided to audit this course both out of curiosity and also to see if it can help me in my informal learning at this stage in my life. From my experience, I endorse much of what has been taught, and would highly commend this course for youngsters who frequently struggle to get their act together in academics or creative pursuits.The course has inspired me to learn what I have always wanted to do (like play music instruments), but for which I found little time earlier.
I love methodology of doing things. This course teaches me the systematic methods of learning, some of which are what I have already known and applied successfully. It provides me a systematic perspective to review and reinforce the methods. Additionally, it not only provides insights on how to learn but also the scientific evidence that underlies the methods. Understanding the rationale helps me applies the techniques better and more flexibly. The course is not limited to any particular subject. It tells us how the brain works. It's helpful in learning anything. Anyone interested in learning should take this course.
I loved this course.  It provides tools for learning that actually work (if you practice!).  Not only does it describe the tools and how to use them, it provides the background, the accumulated understanding and proof of how and why the tools work (with creative illustrations and peer review docs).  Dr's Oakley and Sejnowski do a great job in the curation and presentation of this knowledge.  If they can keep my attention... they can keep anyone's attention.  I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in how we learn and also anyone struggling with learning any subject.  Thank you Dr's Oakley and Sejnowski!!
This course has been great in teaching the mechanics about learning and the practical techniques we can use to enhance our learning process and experience.  Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski have presented key fundamentals to the science of learning in an easy to follow format and have made the process of learning tangible.  I struggle more than most in learning new materials and subjects.  Fortunately, after this course, I have a real practical application, e.g., Pomodoro, Recall, Interleaving, Memory Palace, I can use to progress my life-long learning endeavors.  Thank you Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, and the LHTL team!
Learning How To Learn (LH2L or LHTL) is really so much more than a course. Not only does a learner gain incredibly useful life skills, as outlined in many of the other reviews, but also a community. The Facebook group and weekly e-mail from Barbara Oakley are great resources for a whole plethora of techniques and ideas about improving one's life. I would have been much better off had this course come into my life at a younger age, however, better late than never. I see it as a foundation upon which all of my future learning in life can occur. Please check it out and engage with the community. You will only benefit!
I am so glad I discovered this course right before I begin Ph.D studies. Not only were the lectures insightful, but also the optional expert Interviews and Supplementary readings. This course will definitely transform you into a more conscientious learner. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowksi (and all other background workers) for taking the time to organize and share such useful content in a practical, succinct and lucid way. Examination seasons are approaching in Jamaica, so I am motivated to write an article for the national newspaper to share effective learning strategies based on this course. Thank you again
Dr. Oakley is awesome. She teaches in such a way that learning is not a burden but an ongoing journey. And she doesn't teach as an authority but as a learner and fellow who has experienced the similar struggles or failures. She encourages the learners through the content and also through her expressions and body language. I like how the course is made up with short videos (some other courses have 20 minute long video for a single topic which is quite heavy for brain to digest) and frequently reviews what has been talked about before while teaching something new - just as it teaches, spaced repetition is effective.
Hello there, Coursera is helpful to learn about new things(about programming, languages,health... Etc). I'm enrolling more than two course on coursera. Poromodo technique, I never heard it before but I got all information about poromodo technique in this course. So many things which gave me the technique to study well and improvement towards success & one think, our teacher gave this learning how to learn powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects course as our assignment but when I started to watch i feel happy.One best thing about coursera is they give us certificate after completing enrolled course
Really powerful and useful course about how to learn any subject or skill we want to acquire. This kind of knowledge if something we all should have been tought in school, and I´m grateful to know about how to improve my learning process now and retain more information than before!The course is structured in a way that will enhance your learning, and the classes with Barb are really funny and pleasant. This course is really valuable (much more than what I paid for it), and I encourage you to take it if you are a curious person who loves learning and would like to boost your ability to know about the entire world!
You're on coursera to learn right? This course teaches you how to learn effectively. So while learning to learn might seem like a strange concept (after all you've been doing it all your life) I would advise you to start with this course. That way, you can learn any later course better.This course covers multiple learning techniques and, frankly, a load of techniques which are great to adopt for mental health reasons. This course shows you how to improve yourself more than any course I've come across. Everything is well explained, well sourced and effective. As a bonus, the additional interviews are fascinating.
It's the first MOOC I completed! And it was amazing journey! Learning How to Learn is a great motivator, it encourged me to learning, it braodens horizons... I recomend it to everybody! The course improved my self-esteem... The tutors are great! The material was easy to understand and not so demanding. It was a pleasure to watch the videos! I think the test were sometimes to easy, and you just need to rembember the exact words from the videos, there was almost no need for self-thinking, but still I am extremely happy that my first completed MOOC is Learning How to Learn! It will help me with the new courses ;)
Extremely helpful for people of all ages and from all walks of life. The only really bad thing about this course is that this was not available when I was in school or in my undergrad years. Though, currently I am doing PhD, I still feel its positive effects in my life. I didn't know that this course, which I started in my leisure time, will have long lasting effects on life and the way I think and solve personal and professional issues.Hats off to you Barbara Oaklay, your team and cherishing long journey derived by your passion.Last but not least thanks to Coursera Team for creating such a wonderful platform.
The course was easy to do but I gained a lot of practical advice on studying/learning techniques that are immediately applicable. I also enjoyed the part where we learned the scientific reasons to some of the background processes that drives learning and the fallacies/common misconceptions related to learning. There were many concepts that I already know prior to the course but this course helped me consolidate my knowledge and also increased my enthusiasm in learning something new or challenging. The presenters, Dr Barbara Oakley & Dr Terrence Sejnowski are both very personable and delivered the course well.
The course was created with interest and painstakingly, but half of it was obvious for me: the discussed techniques are possible to see at schools: for example, all the pupils know, that you need to practice and study information by chapters in a long period, not in the last night before exam.But in the whole that was a cool expirience and I found some useful tips. Good analogies which were used in videos helped me to remember rules of effective study better. Furthermore it was a good practice for my English, I enjoyed while listening Barbara Oakley's narrative.Thanks for creators of the course and good luck!
One of the best courses I've taken in Coursera thus far. I
consider myself as someone who works well once I’ve discovered how certain
systems work, which is why I find it incredibly important that this course
taught me how mind works. Being able to understand the different modes of
thinking has also allowed me to embrace my humanity and actually be okay with
it – that is, because I used to think that resting and sleeping are usually counterproductive
for when I’m trying to learn. I find this course essential to people of all age
brackets and sizes! It helped me understand my potential and actually act on
it.
Great stuff! I had a blast with these videos - kinda literally, as I played nearly everything at 1.75x the speed. It was still really fun though, and very useful as well. To be honest, many of the topics that were touched upon were things I had vaguely figured out through my own experiences. However, this course has crystallised and validated those ideas to the point where I feel confident in applying them in real life. I'm absolutely certain that some of my past frustrations with learning were from NOT following the advice here. Thank you for this course! It will help me a lot for my current career-change!
The concepts of chunking, diffused and focused mode or learning, memory, recall, spaced repetition and and beating procrastination through immersing in the process that leads to a product were beautifully introduced in this course by Barbara Oakley and her co-instructors. The material is presented in such a nice way that makes someone readily identify with what one needs to do in order to become a better learner. I recommend this course to everyone regardless of how skillful at learning they are. Understanding your brain and memories is a nice exercise on your road to mastering tough subjects. Kudos Barbara
I
registered the course in order to help me understand more about my brain and improve
my learning ability. That’s satisfied!The
first week, I feel like both of professors are so weird and the video lectures
like the 1960s movie. Surprisingly, after the first week I was looking forward
to see them and the next session. I very much enjoy it. I like the course content- understanding how the brain work and how to get
better brain.I am
very much happy that I had undertaken the Learning How to Learn course. And
thank you so very much Dr. Barb Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for this course.
Happy learning ever :)
The course was very well detailed and helped me broaden my understanding of the learning process much much more. Both the teachers taught in a very interactive way and I very much liked their teaching style. The bite-sized tests at the end of each video were very helpful in retaining the key parts of the material. I am very sure that this course that I just finished will help me in all areas of my life and definitely will help me learn faster and more effectively, now that I have a brief knowledge of how our brain works. I will recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn, "How to learn effectively".
Extraordinary course!Wonderful teachers who are enthusiastic, passionate, and entertaining conveying these simple but Highly effective tips and techniques to make learning easy.Deep insights into the working of the mind, and how it works has helped me battle procrastination, become task oriented (by focusing on the processes not the product), and taught me the secrets to retain what I have learned.It's a wonder that this course isn't taught in every school. I went through 12+ years of education and this information was never taught to me.Thank you for this free and powerful course.To a life of learning!
I am 35 and this course took me back to my school/college days and i could really compare that yes unknowingly i was applying,  the well defined techniques of this course , by default and those helped me really well in achieving my dream career. I remember i used to write every illustration to feed it in my permanent memory. Also i used to thoroughly read the entire theory part before starting the mathematics illustrations. So i understand and can relate to this course very practically but yes there are enumerous value additions that this course has made in my learning way. Thank you Barbara and Terren.
Can you imagine a course that can change your life? Learn how to learn is a course like this! I'm 29 old and I'd like to had the opportunity to took this course fifteen years early. Whatever I'm profoundly happy to know better how my brain works. How to improve my memory, how to avoid procrastination, to avoid impostor syndrome and a lot of very interesting stuff. I'me a lecturer in Brazil and I will spread the contents of that course to a thousands of brazilian people. Everybody needs to know this contents. My special thanks to Barbra Oakley, Terence Sejnowski and Coursera's team! You made a great job!
This course has been utterly brilliant. I almost cannot describe the important things I've learnt, the new techniques to try and the confidence it's given me. I am hoping to study a Masters of Research next year, however, it's been a long time since I've done any formal study. This course has given me the confidence to believe I can be successful in my studies, as well as the techniques to make sure that is true. I would recommend it to *anyone* who is considering a new course of study after a period of non-study. This course gives you the tools and confidence to study anything. It is utterly brilliant.
The thing is I love learning new things and try continuously to learn new skills. And that's the reason this course attracts me. After completing this course I came to learn about my brain and its working and how can I use my brain more efficiently. Also came to know about various techniques few I already using, few I learnt new and came to know what I was doing wrong.So I would recommend this course to all students out there. Also recommend it to those who like to learn new things or trying to switch career by learning.This course gives insight how can you do better in your academic/professional life.
All the content in this course is really interesting and useful. I watch it at 1.5x speed most of the time. This class should be required education before attempting to learn anything else. The idea that nearly all students are expected to learn subjects without having first being taught how to learn is ridiculous.Note to Barbara Oakley for whoever is managing this MOOC: Please remove the repetitive superfluous phrases from quizzes, "as several of the videos mentioned," "as one video emphasized," etc. Just remove all references to the videos. They are unnecessary, and only make the quizzes take longer.
THIS Course is extremely useful for every one.The way Barbara Oakley explains is fab .I would recommend any one who is sitting free  to utilize their time by doing this course u will love it professor  Terrence Sejnowski teaches the working of our mind that will be great help for people not only for particular subjects like maths and science but  in each part of life. One  could apply THESE principles can take a full control over the procrastination. The course teach exactly what we need to overcome procrastination and will be enjoying various process in their life.Why r u waiting for enroll it now.
Very good insights. It is nice to understand how your brains works when it is involved on a leaning process. And even though, it uses some concepts and tips we already  know, it is also important to rethink about then, for knowing something exists does't mean you use it properly.The teacher are just spectacular. The lessons are really enjoyable. And i found it quite useful to learning and practice English.The questions on the and of each video are very good. They are obvious most of the time but, by reading then, we use the recalling process taught on the second week, and it helps us to chunk then.
This course is awesome. Dr. Oakley has taught many helpful skills on how to learn. But for me, the most important and most helpful thing, is that you are not born to become who or born to be specifically proficient in some subjects. As long as you learn with right methods, you can learn anything. For long I've been trapped and handicapped by the "einstellung" that I'm not a math or physics learner. Now I'm completely confident that all I need is to walk away from the comfort zone and learn efficiently with those useful and scientific methods. Many thanks to Coursera and the course team. Thank you!
Great course. Very useful techniques, easy to understand concepts and helpful to make you more productive. I learned how to stay focused in my studies, keep the information in my memory for more time, how to avoid procrastination, how to prepare for a test and the importance of stress management before test. Also, which part of the material I should focus on when I'm learning new topics. I recommend this course for everyone who's focused in develop yourself and learn techniques that help to learn fast and more easily. The last month was great. Thanks for all. I'm a new student after this course.
This course was invaluable to me in teaching best practices for learning. I consider myself a lifelong learner and have been seeking useful techniques for learning difficult material and retaining new material. I didn't take to any suggestions from a previous informal "study habits" mini-course, and for over a decade, I just resigned myself to not being intellectually able or disciplined enough to tackle certain subjects, but Professor Oakley's teachings encourage me to mount and master learning mountains. This was a fantastic course, and I have already recommended Prof. Oakley's work to others.
I am 50 years old, I love learning, and I keep on learning! I took this course to get "how to" learning tips to share with my elementary students and my 11 year-old son in their studies; however, even though I have a bachelor's degree and I thought I knew enough techniques on how to learn, I found myself learning interesting and very efficient techniques that I had never heard of before.I recommend this course to any student, no matter their age, to learn how to efficiently increase their retention capabilities and even how to relieve stress prior to testing.Thanks Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
This Course was hands down phenomenal and so fundamental for anyone wanted to facilitate a better understanding in how are brains work and process information. If you ever once wonder why sometimes you beat information into your cranium and come to find out a few days later you forgot everything, well this course will explain and talk about focused mode and diffused mode of learning. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to be a well rounded and efficient learner.  I would like to thank the amazing instructors for this course and this opportunity to grow and enhance our brains.
well at the starting of this course I think that the topics that are in this course are already known by me. But when I go through this course I found that the small things that we don't consider during our learning phase will make us suffer in the particular subject. So here I have got those small and necessary things that are required to learn new things or subjects very effectively, not only for temporary time period but also for life time.If someone is thinking about doing this course then my opinion is you should definitely go for this, before starting learning new subjects in your life.
This is an amazing course. First of all, it was well made. Every video is entertaining and informative. They include sources for each point they make. The quizzes are also very useful to help you understand the info. In addition, the instructors speak clearly and passionately in the course. It's rewarding to not only learn how to learn, but also see the neuroscience behind the process. The syllabus is clear and helpful for anyone. It covers everything needed for one to be a successful learner. From chunking to memory tactics to how to tackle procrastination and tests. Overall, a great course.
This was an excellent primer on the subject of learning. As someone who's passionate about learning, this course was basically like healthy crack-cocaine - I think I finished it in 4 or 5 days because I enjoyed it so much. I particularly enjoyed the section on procrastination. There is a lot of actionable advice throughout the course that is complemented with solid neuroscience. Learning is basically a superpower that impacts every other area of your life, so a course like this has massive carryover to everything you do. Overall, I highly recommend LHtL and will be pointing friends toward it.
life changing course for me. i think everybody should take this course and that it should be included in the curiculum of all schools. this course helps you maximise what you learn from every course. to maximise what you learn from this course you need to have taken this course (do you see our dilemma here !). here is a tip from someone who has completed this course using the material he learned from this course. try recalling what you learned after each video. and try to make a list of practical applications that this course has inspired you to do and write them down and start applying them.
I really enjoyed this course. Just a few days before I've joined the course me and my colleagues have submitted the draft of the course for teachers "How to apply metocagnition in order to help students to learn". Improving that course I will be able to use some ideas from this course. It's a pitty that I had not enough time to work on this course because of the very busy time for teachers at the university. But I was also able to see how the distance course ir organized and will be able to apply some ideas working on my distance courses (if it will be needed because of the pandemic). Thanks
After completing this course, the enlightenment has not only enhanced my learning of courses, concepts and ideas but also given me valuable tools to be more productive in my personal life: Tackling other topics like procrastination, handling fear, being confident, looking to broaden your passions rather than limiting yourself to things that you are "naturally good at", and more has greatly improved my life!

There should be no hesitation towards taking this course, even if you have a way of going about your learning, there's always a perspective you are missing out on (Einstellung) !Regards!
it's a very good course, useful for all. It explains learning techniques in a scientific way. I learnt here how to train my mind to learn things effectively and keep them in my memory for longer time. The course explains how to use focused and diffused mode to solve new problems. The course very well explains how to deal with a habit of procrastination and also how Einstellung prevents us from learning new things. Actually every video teaches us so many things. Barb and Terry are awesome in teaching. I recommend this course to the people of all age groups who are willing to learn something.
Thanks a lot for the cource and for your job. It helped me to look on learning process with new and fresh perspective.Some ideas i did't know, I find usefull for me even in daily small tasks as well as during my learning and training process. But not only small techniques, the whole cource like big and strong concept how you can understand, organize build you learning process and get you learning goals done more effectiveand be more productive much easier with no frustration )))))It provides you to understand how it's works on more deeper level. Thank you very muchAnd Greetings from Russia
I found the course material and the presentation style to be very engaging and very easy to apply in my personal and professional life. As a project manager, a team leader, a teacher, and just as a person who is always looking to learn new things, I left this course very satisfied and fulfilled. I've already recommended this course to several of my friends and have already applied techniques, such as the pomodoro technique and recall in my daily life, while also examining how einstellung transpires in my day to day decision-making. Thank you for the wonderful lessons the past few weeks!!!!
This is an excellent and valuable course. It is useful for all people, whether young or old. It has the ability to change, not only the way people learn, but also the entire life of an individual. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable, as it is seen from the videos itself, and fascinating too. During the course, I was continuously gaping and marveling at the videos and the wonderful facts that were completely unknown to me. Never before, had I even ventured to know about the brain and the things that affect it. I hope each and every individual has the opportunity to view this course.
The course was fun and motivating. The learned material helped me better learn the course itself. I am now able to accomplish twice the tasks I used too before, which is important to me as a fool time autodidact learner. The whole experience was also encouraging for me to keep pursuing my goals and studies, feeling competent,  as well as enjoying preparing and reviewing the daily and weekly tasks and ways of studies.Thanks to the tools I have acquired in this course, in just one month, I've been able to improve my third language to the best state it took for the past four years. Thank you
I have tried to start college 3 times. I always start off motivated but then lose drive, focus, become intimidated by the material and gradually discouraged. Then I drop the classes and repeat... This course taught me so much that I have already applied to my life, job, and education. I recommend this to everyone no matter there education level, age, career path, etc. Learning How to Learn has taught me how to study, focus, retain, and change the way I view a tough task whether it be a ten page essay, big project for work, or an errand I've dreaded for far too long. Thank you, Professors!
I enrolled in this course because of my new job.  I'm an analyst trainee and in order to help me learn my job, I needed to learn how to learn. This course gave me some very useful information and techniques that I've already started to apply (Pomodoro technique, chunking, memory palace - all of this takes practice!). I recommend this course to anyone - students, employees who are learning something new on the job, or just anyone who has the desire to gain new skills. Many thanks to the instructors and UC San Diego for providing this course. I was engaged and excited to start each lesson.
I can't thank you enough for such an amazing course with all the techniques you provided and the interesting way of interpreting how our minds work.  Indeed, it's a very useful course covering concepts behind how to learn effectively and efficiently.This course is applicable in all aspects of life. Because of this course, now I understand the process of learning better, and because I understand a little better, I've become more motivated in trying new things out.I want to thank the tutors for this wonderful useful course and their videos, and I look forward to seeing more of their work.
In italiano: si tratta di un corso utile perchè si focalizza su qualcosa che raramente viene insegnato (almeno nelle scuole italiane) ovvero a COME studiare piuttosto che a cosa studiare. E' valsa la pena seguirlo. Grazie a tutte le persone coinvolte in questo progetto.English: it's a MOOC worth his while because it focus on something seldom teached in school that is HOW study and not on what to study. Follow the course is, in my opinion a good way to spend a little of your time to get many cue on how improve yourself. Thank you to all the people involved in this project.Luciano Ciotola
Amazing course given by amazing people! the course chunks the idea of learning and explains it very well. The course provides techniques to learn and to combat procrastination. I have discovered that I didn't know how to learn and all my previous study sessions were totally ineffective! This course doesn't just apply if you are learning in school or college but also it applies in the work place! More and more we as individuals are committed to a life long learning, and this course is the perfect companion to hone in the right skills needed to learn! Thank you for such a brilliant work!
I loved doing this course. It gave a lot of insight in learning, always in short clear video's. I especially enjoyed it, because you didn't have to view all videos at once to understand the information. You could easily stop somewhere and pick it up two days later. The test at the end of a "chunk" of information was nice to really check if you understood everything. And after this course I not only have some new tools which I'm using when learning, I was also able to find out where in my learning I could improve. Thank you for making this course available for Free. Much appreciated!!!
Amazing course! I took this course out of curiosity, but it turned out to be a prespective-changing course. I am really inspired by the contents of this course and the efforts they have put into making the complicated contents easily understandable. The Instructors have addressed many problematic issues for students such as imposter syndrome, procrastination, and also preparing for the test. I am really grateful to the instructors for making this course. I recommend this course to all the students and lifelong learners. I hope you find this course as helping and interesting as I did.
Fantastic Course! Helpful and full of quirky, actionable information to help people learn, retain information and perform better when test taking. Concise videos with funny and amusing examples and enough extra reading material to encourage more curios individuals to further pursue their learning efforts around this subject!                                                                                                                                              A huge Thank you to Dr. Barbara, Dr. Terrence and of course, the rest of the team which helped make this MOC a success =)!
I really enjoyed this class. It gave practical and immediately useful ways of learning just about any material, and was a great motivator for trying to learn not just about learning, but several other subjects that I've been putting off. Dr. Oakley's clear, and fun examples not only helped me remember the concepts, but also modeled what methods I could be employing as I learn on my own. Highly recommended (and sent to a couple of college-freshmen-to be!). Wish I'd had it back in my college/post university studies; it would have made life and learning both more effective and more fun.
Although I started off the course with not a lot of dedication and concentration (one of the reasons why I decided to take it up - my lack of commitment), the course definitely got me hooked even though it sometimes used terms I have been unaware of. Barbara really made it an easy to understand and take control of two of my age old enemies - lack of willpower and excess of procrastination. Now that I understand the science behind why we do what we do, why we think why we think, I believe it will definitely be much easier for me to tackle this in the future. Do give this course a go!
As opposed to having one long video or lecture per week, the short video clips made it easier to complete the weekly assignments thereby completing the entire course.  The course has increased my self-confidence in my learning abilities by realizing that my way of learning throughout the years, by writing the material and testing myself, has not been effective because of a self-perceived learning disability, but these methods are truly effective for all learners.  As for my school-aged children, it further validates their Grandmother's advice about learning and test performance. :)
This course was amazingly eye-opening and encouraging! I've struggled my entire life with the limiting belief that there is something wrong with my brain because I don't seem to retain information as easily as my fellow peers. Thanks to the information in this course I've realized that this belief, coupled with the ineffective techniques I've been using are the real reason I've been struggling. My brain is in fact completely capable! This course is a healthy dose of vitamins for the mind. I'm so excited to apply what I've learned to all the subjects I've avoided learning thus far!
This is a great course that brings scientific knowledge about the workings of human brain and teaches the ways to maximize results when studying for a test/examination or competition. The course is full of research backed data and interviews from academicians who shed light on their own ways of learning and success.I was glued to this course from start to end as if it was a Netflix TV series. It is that gripping and delivers great information in lucid and easy to digest format. Highly recommended for anyone preparing for any big test in need of an extra edge in their performance!
Thank you for providing insight into the indoctrination process that began in early childhood. Antithesis modeling of globular science, Darwinian evolution and the total elimination of the Creationist model of belief. This course further reinforced my belief that men and women in power have abandoned critical thinking but will blindly follow the beliefs of previous generations without having the ability to go against the schooling from liberal institutions with only creating sheep. Thank you again for reminding me of the power of illusion that is witchcraft of the highest order.
I love this course! It is endlessly fascinating to me, and actually one of my "problems" is I NEVER want to just do the coursework. I want to read EVERY optional reading, and view EVERY optional video, and so on! The ability to switch sessions has been lifesaving for me! Although I'm not getting the certification, so I do have that flexibility, thanks to Coursera and the instructors! I am very encouraged by Dr, Oakley's personal turnaround in her areas of expertise AND career-satisfaction! I highly recommend this course to ANYONE who is trying to learn, and who enjoys learning!
Excellent course! I thought it would be just another bit of practical advice to scroll through and pick up a couple of gems of insight from the rubble. But the whole course was amazing! It provided so MUCH insight into the neuroscience and brain processes involved in learning and paired it with techniques to hone skills. I came away recommending it to all of my friends, and with a better grasp on the second language (espanol) I've been working on for forever. I never thought I would get such immediate real world application from what I had considered an 'extra' type of course.
This is a fantastic course and should be either a prerequisite or recommendation for anyone taking any Coursera course. It's simple, easy, insightful, and yet very powerful. Most of the the observations on how to learn may already be familiar, but the explanations put things into a coherent framework. A great review of some useful techniques to help save time by learning more efficiently and productively.Kudos to the presenters and UCSD for keeping it light hearted, interesting, and engaging!I can not recommend this essential course highly enough: Does what it says on the tin!
Today, when social media and many other platforms are affecting career choices of many people- just due to the fact, that technical stream needs more efforts to be put in. Young people take it as their own inability or that the subjects to be very tough... This course fills our minds with motivation, energy and equips us with the necessary skills to study in the best way.With psychological and biological reasoning, it brings us the best effective way to - how to learn anything in the best way.Thank you so much to both the instructors - it has entirely changed the way I learn.
I had seen many video's before and thought this course would be the same, but I was wrong, Beautifully organised lecture sessions, simple visuals to understand the concepts made my learning experience very productive. I am an Instructor and will be using these techniques not only for myself but also for designing exercises and problems for my students. You guys have nailed the actual understanding of how to learn. the Interviews and reading material were very useful and motivating. Kudos to the team for such in depth work and your passion for this subject is just contagious!!
I absolutely loved the course. I genuinely think it helped me learn and improve on things I've been wanting to learn for ages, and I'm so much for enthusiastic to learn now. I appreciate that you took the time to explain everything, even on the neurological level, and so empathetically, that I wanted to come back to the course and learn more, and also for patiently repeating material over the videos so it stayed rooted in my mind. I do think I respond well to kinder teachers so thank you do much for being so patient and hopeful and encouraging. Can't wait for the next course.
This online course absoloutely deserves to earn these 5 stars , I can't seriously believe how much I've been taught and how much I've learnt in a such short period of time .I'm beyond happy and pleased to be quite honest since this course reveals and uncovers many extremely helpful tools that we can use on daily basics in our lives and which will also come with great benefits and results to us , so therefore I would really like to cease this opportunity in order to applaud and show my big and sincere gratitude to whoever has  contributed to the success of this splendid work !
A great course, divided into mini digestible parts that any person can grasp. Although sometimes it stated some obvious things, but that does not, in any way, lessen the impact of this course on forming a wider perspective towards learning. What I really loved is that, during and after finishing this course, I started to implement what I learnt here to other fields and in my daily life. I felt happier when I could relate the things they said while actually doing  day to day chores. Maybe that was the main objective of this course, use this to better other parts of your life.
Wonderful course!  I am a student that has been diagnosed with severe ADHD.  My goal going into this course was to find a few techniques that would help me along the way but I found so much more here!  First, the instructors are clear and concise; giving just the right amount of information that you need to comprehend the material.  I was certainly able to understand the techniques and have been able to apply them successfully to various parts of my life. I cannot thank you enough for putting this course out there as I can truly say that it has changed my life.  Thank you!!
Very professional course, thank you for that! The only thing I was missing in this course was how to learn in non-academical conditions. How to find time if you work 8 hours per day and come home tired while you have prepare something to eat and so on...? How to motivate yourself if there is no test, if you are learning only for yourself? How you can practice that what you are learning if you are doing something completely different in your professional life? These are questions for that I really need an answer, the rest I know from your course, big thank you once again! :)
This is an incredible course that gives insight on techniques to improve learning, and also helps you develop a better understanding of your learning style. Professor Oakley has a great lecture style and she also includes many other resources, such as interviews with academics of all different fields and even our fellow classmates,  and plenty of reading material. Professor Oakley makes great connections from the material to real-life situations, and she shares some anecdotes and experiences, which really makes for a fun class setting.   I recommend this course to everyone!
Taking this course has changed my all my pre-existing views about learning thus allowing me to be the best learner I can be. Our lovely professors will teach you about how your brain works, giving you more insights on how to take better control of your learning. Learning is something we do lifelong, and I think that taking this course will really change your life and your approach. This is not just about "academic" learning or "learning in school"; this will really change your outlook and teach you all the things you deserve to know that weren't taught to us anywhere else.
Learning how to learn is an exceptionally well planned & executed course. For people who have like yours truly are pursuing a degree, also the same is very beneficial. To loosely refer to one of the quotes from the this course that I have completed , If we are thrown into the water and we do not know how to swim is akin to trying to learn something new without learning to learn. I thank Coursera & University of California to literally teaching me to swim (in the ocean of learning) & now its upto me to swim ashore or may I add cross the channel. Much Thanks & most grateful.
I have been in the work force for over 30 years and need to take courses to upgrade my skills. I decided to take this course to help understand the techniques that would help improve my chances of retaining the information that I'm learning in other courses. I enjoyed taking this course as it was fun and easy to understand the concepts and material being introduced. I recommend this course to anyone who think only their method of learning is perfect for them. You will realize that there are other methods that are much easier to implement. Thank you for this amazing course.
Inspiring!There are truly no limits to what you can learn and achieve. Find out how you can move on from the limitations that you, or others, might have placed on you because of your earlier academic performance or the subjects that you have studied. This course will also show you how to best utilize your study time to get the best results. Some of the principles taught can be used beyond the classroom and can help in other areas of your life.The course content is always interesting and I've thoroughly enjoyed the bonus interview material.Thank you for an excellent course!
It was really cool to learn research-backed information on what is happening in our brain while we are learning and to get some tips to improve our learning skills. I hope to use this knowledge for the many topics I still wish to learn throughout my life and also to teach my girls how to learn better . Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for sharing your knowledge with the world. Learning is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences one can have. Thank you for encouraging and making this experience accessible to anyone who wishes to pursue it.
I have given this course 5 stars even though I think that there is room for improvement in the videos.  At times it feels like I am watching somebody reading slowly from an autocue/teleprompter.   Apart from this I would recommend this course to everyone.  I would even like to see Coursera have it linked directly to their landing web page.  After all, this site is all about learning, and making sure that everybody is approaching the learning process as well prepared as possible is in everybody's best interest (including Coursera and those that create the course material).
I have learned the really powerful techniques to tackle procrastination in this course. Time plan is really useful and efficient. Write down the task list for the next day is really helpful for me to keep thing on track.  Review the task list to mark the unfinished work is also important. Before taking this course, I always waste time on trying to remember what to do at the beginning of a day. And I always begin to do a task without finishing it, then forget it totally. This is the only course I have persisted to finish all the quiz. The feeling of fulfilment is amazing.
This MOOC will change your mindset about learning. I have learned a lot about learning during this course. It is well-structured. I loved the optional readings and interviews because these helped me gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.I have unintentionally practised some of the methods taught in this course in the past and I would endorse them like spaced repetition helps you recall materials much quicker and working on difficult problems helps you become a better and faster problem solver.I hope to incorporate the teachings from this course in my study routine.
Hands down one of the best courses I have ever taken. The reason I found the course extremely helpful is because even before taking the course, some of the techniques discussed were implemented in my study routines and they helped me boost my grades significantly. So naturally, when I find those techniques and many others that I wasn't aware of in the course material, I am assured that I am in the right place. Also Dr. Oakley radiates such a warm and encouraging vibe that that makes you want to have some patience and take tiny steps toward your learning goals! Loved it!
I'm a bad learner, and have never been a teacher favorite. I've struggled with procrastination for my entire life and it has knocked me down over and over. I found the tips in this course to be helpful, and relevant. I started this course to give myself the best chance in a college program, and I even started it with a bad attitude. After finishing the first week, I'm so excited to put what I've already learned into action, and I really feel a connection to Barbra Oakly, guys shes a northern badass. Thanks for this course, you've got this bad student on the right track.
Looking for something different that will increase your knowledge of new areas?  Consider taking this course.  One of the most fundamental skills that people are not taught is how to learn.  This course will give you some very insightful insights about how to be a more effective learner.  Topics such as memory loss, procrastination, connecting ideas, sleep, and so forth are covered on this.  It is an easy course that does not require a lot of time, but will be valuable for learners.  My learning abilities greatly increased after taking this course.  Highly recommended!
I absolutely love this course. I have studied Positive Psychology and are working with children with learning disabilities. Everybody can learn and succeed with these tools... Regardless age, regardless "labeled with learning disabilities". Im personally deeply fascinated by the brain and I am very fond of the explaining of the brain in the course, which explain so perfectly, why we act as we do.... And for children (or families) with working disabilities they need more than anyone to understand why they act like they do.EVERYONE CAN LEARN.....EVERYONE CAN FLOURISH....
a life changing course! During the course i have changed many small habits that were keeping me from reaching my personal and professional goals. By understanding how the minds works, you can trick it by setting rewards and following well studied anti-procrastination methods.During the course i was also listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson podcast, which made a lot of sense in according to this course's material, so if you're looking for an extreme change to your life, take this course, listen to Jordnan Peterson, and you'll be a different person within weeks.Thnak you!
Doing this course was indeed a very good experience. I am looking to change my career and trying to learn computer programming and which is exactly why I have done this course. After finishing the course, I believe it is not only my study that is being helped, I believe I have got a very good amount of real life tips as well which will help me in my career as well. Being a procrastinator, I have harmed my life already a lot. But now that I know how to handle procrastination, I will try my best to implement the tricks that I have learned in this course. Thanks a lot!
Learning How To Learn will get you to think differently about procrastination and what you can do about it now. Do yourself a favor. If you are struggling to understand tough subjects or suffer like most people from procrastination, this course will offer a fresh perspective on why we do what we do and what you can change to turn it around. This course should be mandatory in high school or for first year incoming college students. You will walk away learning at least one new thing that will help you to improve your studies, test taking and performing under pressure.
It is a wonderful course that indeed makes the difference. Over it "I've met myself" almost in each video and each topic. Very surprisingly that somebody knows me better than I do and is searching for sintific solutions of my problems in a daily professional fashion. I did realize a lot of things about myself and how things work for or against me, how to reinforce my cons and extract maximum efficiency of pros. How much learning means and how strongly influences human beings. All from the above will be essential for you if you wish to upgrade yourself and your life.
Really enjoyed this course and it helped me get back into learning during lockdown! Very effective format and really helped me understand and unlock more about how the brain works to learn (or try to not learn) and what I can do to get myself out of those procrastination ruts and to switch off from things I think I have no aptitude for when actually it's all about my efforts. Barbara was an excellent Teacher and Facilitator, loved her insightful and interesting explanations that kept me engaged throughout the course. Loved this so much I've signed up for Mindshift!
I love the course, I am a procrastinative person but with studying through the course I realized I could do so much more. This process wasn't boring, in fact it was made easy! It was like learning something you're interested in, and I wasn't even all too interested in the beginning. It made me feel (and know!) what it's like to learn and gave me things and techniques to look out for in my study habits. Not only in studying in academe but in learning in life, by having this beautifully made 'manual' to the brain I am thankful. Cheers to a brighter fulfilled future!
First and foremost, Thanks to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the team for creating such a wonderful course.This is the first course that i've completed on Coursera. It has completely changed my mindset and how i approach my life day to day. This course may seem like it's just useful if you are preparing for a test, but it's much more than that. You'd have different techniques to tackle out some fundamental problems, like Procrastination, Lack of interest in new things, afraid of new areas be it in your current field or a new career altogether.Highly recommended.
This course is condensed in such a way, with amazing visual cues and guides, that it is very easy to understand and commit to memory. The videos are short enough, such that it is very easy to schedule breaks inbetween. It is also such that each video is neither too long or too short, fitting the length of one's attention span. Overall, the attention to detail, both within and outside the contents of the course (i.e the content itself and the way it is structured) is masterfully developed for easy understanding. The course is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone.
Wow! This course came just at the right time in my life. Unemployed and doubting my own self-confidence, I had internalized all my failures as innate reflections of who I am––a failure. This course taught me (and in some points, re-taught me) the neuroscience, psychology and physiology of how human leverage their greatest evolutionary advantage, learning. Having completed this course, I've regained much of my self-confidence, and I am, once again, ready to get back out in the world, now knowing, I am capable, with hard work and perseverance, of learning anything.
I love how friendly Dr. Oakley appears to be. She is always so excited about the material it automatically makes me more interested in what she has to say. I think sharing her background and struggles made her down-to-earth and made me feel like if she can do it I can do it too. Many professors act as if they are high and mighty and that you could never be as intelligent as they are. Dr. Oakley showed me through her personal story and her teaching material that if I use the tips and techniques I've learned through both of her courses I can truly learn ANYTHING!!!
Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for this amazing course.This course was very challenging for me because I haven't studied for 20 years and it was my first english specific course with an anglophone university ... You definitively changed my way of thinking about learning and my life thanks to all these mental tools...learning how the brain works, how to built more neurons and to strenghten them was amazing... I discovered Neuroscience and I love it.Learning has become for me an evidence because it opens our mind ... So thank you very much :-)
I wish I could have taken this course at the beginning of high school. While I always did well enough in school, part of me truly believed there were some things I just couldn't do well because I didn't "get" them. This course set me straight. Learning takes time and practice - the people we think are the "smartest" or "most successful" are often the ones who work hard and focus on doing better. It sounds cliché, but I realized upon completing this course that my own fear of failure has prevented me from learning some really hard (and often meaningful) subjects.
This is a great course that you can apply to a broad number of things. From learning a new hobby, to acing an exam. I've been slowly applying what I've learned even during taking the course. I know understand my brain better, and see the cues of procrastination and have been better at avoiding them—but still fall into the trap. I feel like a much more functional human being just from taking this course, and have already gotten over a work slump that I having trouble with (a difficult project that I've been putting off was completed by doing the Pomodoro Method.)
It has been a wonderful experience learning about the learning processes. One can easily see the amount of work done behind to get all these ideas together. The instructors both were highly dedicated to this work and I can see there efforts through the massive amount of research papers reviewed while forming this course materials. I found the course to be very helpful in changing my perspective on the process of learning and cannot thank enough for including the interviews of such highly ambitious different thinking peoples. Thank you for preparing this course.
I am very happy to share my feelings about this course, before this course I have my own methods of reading and preparing in that some are helpful and most of them are not, after completion of the course I have understood the structerd way of learning. How foucused mode and diffused modes of thingking works. The interviews with some of great minds also inspires me a lot. Not but not the least Thaks to Dr. Barbara Okley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for providing such a wonderful and helpful lecture series. Finaly thanks to the total team of Learnig How to Learn...
This was an amazing course, that not only help deepen my understanding of the brain, but also my own brain and how I work. It's hard to really delve into graduate level course work, especially in a high stakes field like medicine. As I go through medical school, I realize that I am doing well to get A's or B's on my exams. But that isn't helping me fully deepen my knowledge. I'm really good at just recall. But this course helped me understand how to really improve my memory and my understanding of a subject, and not just regurgitate the information on an exam.
Thank you SO MUCH ! This has been GREAT! I have learned so much about myself and my former destructive habits. With the insights from this course, I'm now starting to build up new skills that I have been dreaming of for years. Instead of blacking out when I meet obstacles or challenges, I move forward overcome them - and incredibly GROW STONGER! This course has served me not only with power study skills, but as way to understand myself and how to work with my competences in a more enjoyable and creative way. This course has changed my F''' lyfe. You rock BARB
This was one of the best courses I've ever had here, on Coursera. I could think out of the box and also help my students to achieve different ways of studying English. I saw different approaches in learning tough subjects that I study by my own, and I also shared with my students to help them how to study, following the Hard start - jump to easy method; the benefits of sleeping to learn better; the chunk formation, and other powerful tools you'd shared in this course. Thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and all the team that made this course.
I wish I had taken this course when I started school. Put in better words an adequate version based on age and grade of study. This is definitely something that has to be taught to students in some degree to provide them with tools on how to learn and study better.That would take most of any negative connotation related to school, homework, testing and studying. Not only teaching and learning would be better and easier but also the level of performance would be astronomically greater.Hands down one of the best courses I've taken so far!! strongly recommended!
Make yourself a favor, just take the course. I have done a lot of the opposite of what I should have done. Barbara Oakley is so nice to explain to you, every video is easy to muster and follow. The course is not solely study techniques in the conventional form, the most valuable parts are how our brain solves problems and the basic chemistry that affects it. I enjoyed, I have not finished watching the optional videos but I will and even bought the book. Definitely will review it often or as Dr Barbara said "try to recall" big parts of it and learn it deeply.
This is an amazing course. While deceptively short, it holds a wealth of information about learning and the science behind it. What I like the most are the optional videos and readings. I think half the time I spent on this course was spent reading blogs, articles, scientific journal articles, and reading video transcripts from optional resources. While some of the tips seemed to me, at first, pedantic and repetitive, learning the science behind them instilled in me new appreciation for them. This course was also a great reminder why I truly enjoy learning.
Excellent course. Being 78, I have developed during the years, mainly by trial and error, some learning techniques.It is very rewarding to find out the reasons why some work, and learn many other, some counterintuitive, ways of improving concentration, avoid procrastination, and get better at passing tests.Course is very clearly explained, has ample bibligraphy to further develop any subject of particular interest, and presents interviews with people who have either developed or succeeding in applying these techniques in defferent fields.Highly recommended
This is a marvelous course. Lectures sent my enthusiasm into deeper learning at additional resources many time. I have recommended the course to peers (retired) and to parents of struggling youth, as well as to folks who need to master new skills. Oakley is fantastic and so down-to-earth and real. Never enjoyed a course more, and will probably go thru it again to refresh periodically. Highly recommended for anyone to wants to get a handle on the pragmatic steps to getting something into your head! Let Oakley take you by the hand, you won't regret the time.
Just finished the course and I'm very impressed. I came to the conclusion that I had many pits in learning. This course offered me the opportunity to pinpoint these obstacles. It further widened my insight into what learning is all about and how to maximize benefit from learning any topic. Throughout the course, I've done many tasks that either involve me learning new material or ticking off some points off my to-do list. To my surprise, I was able to finish off many tasks and learn in a non labored and efficient way. Learning became rather interesting!!!
During this course i've had the pleasure of deepening my understanding of memory tools I knew of, and learning about memory tools I had never heard of before. The course has a very logical and easy to follow program. Applying everything you learn, will definitely help you in life as you seek to broaden your horizons.I took this course because i wanted to take other courses after this one and starting here seemed to be the most logical thing to do. I recommend learning how to learn to anyone who has no idea what learning is beyond reading stuff in a books.
You truly are the greatest teacher ever. Thank you! Thank you for sharing with me the love you have for education. I'll always appreciate the way you've teached me in this  course. You gave me the strength I needed to take the next steps toward my dream. "The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away." i 'm so grateful you were my teacher in this course.                                                                                                                                                        Thank you so much
An amazing course which should be obligatory in every high-school. Learning how to learn in the early stage of your life (especially before you start going to the faculty) can be invaluable. Some people are "lucky" enough to find their own methods (which work amazing for them) during their learning journey, as was the case with me, but we should make it systematic by integrating it into the official school system! And even for people that already have success with learning, we can always learn new and useful tips & tricks, as I did finishing this course.
I found it very interesting, came in well-sized portions (chunks) on an easy-to-understand way. You do not need to be master in neuroscience to understand and it actually showed some useful techniques what resonated with my past experience in learning.  I try to get my son to complete it as I would have benefited a lot from this knowledge if I had the opportunity to learn how to learn when I was in his age.Thanks a lot for Barb
Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the  Team Learning How to Learn for the opportunity, it was a great experience to take this course!
Excellent course!  I have an amateur love of the brain and this course helped to solidify my understanding of how the brain learns through metaphor and analogy. I've taken away many practical tools to help me better learn, most notably the pomadoro technique and allowing myself diffuse thinking when writing. This latter tool, by turning my screen black when I type, has been a huge help to get my out of Einstellung  and the focus/edit mode which can prohibit my writing and leave me stuck. Thank you for this excellent course - can't wait to take Mindshift!
This course has been very helpful in identifying where I was going wrong in my studying habits. It has helped me build mental calibre to approach learning new things while being excited about it rather than having any kind of fear. The course is very insightful and will make one realize every single damn thing they have been doing wrong while learning. Lastly, the learnings from this course is going to stay with me for the rest of my life and I am gonna learn everything more effectively. Thank you, @Barbara Oakley for sharing this awesome course with us.
THis course takes the science behind learning, a very complex subject, and makes it easy to understand and apply. Dr. Oakley teaches techniques to use, the best methods for using them, and the reasoning behind them. During the course, both instructors apply techniques to varying subjects and varying levels of study. I enjoyed this course both for the serious science and practical information, and for the levity and enthusiasm with which the instructors approached the topic. The further reading references were very helpful and thought provoking, as well.
It is a course that opened my eyes to the latest advances in neuroscience with its connection to learning. It could have saved my a lot of time had I learned it growing up, not to mention that I could have earned better grades as well. Thanks to Barbara and Terry, the current and future generations can benefit from the research and the ways of learning they put together. I want to point out that the course caters to a broad audience, so it does not go into the depths. Some of the reading materials they put down are great. It is worthwhile to read them.
I am so sad to see this class end.  (At this moment, I'm at the very end of the last week.)  So much information, presented so elegantly, explaining so much, answering questions I've had much of my life, this course was amazing. Now, I just have to get every, single human I know and love to take the course next time it's offered. (Thank God that's only a week or so away!)  I'm going to take it again, too.  It's changed my life once, and I've got this feeling that if I give the information a second go-over, it may change my life at an even deeper level.
I learned from this course a lot , unfortunately I didn't complete it due to pressing business conditions as I was diligently searching for a job since my manager fired me because I used to watch the course videos during my break time using the company internet so he counted this situation as an abuse to company resources but I believe he fired me because I'm christian. Anyways, I would like to thank you so much for all the valuable information that I have gained from your course.Barbra, you are wonderful .... keep up the great work.Regards,Mina Samir
This course is amazing, the kind of things that you learn are awesome and very useful because you learn how brains work and why sometimes we don't get the understand of some topics. I recommend this course to any kind of student or professional, this will teach you a lot of useful tools that can improve your job and your life as well. The teachers are concise and the lessons explain the topic without blind points, Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terry are awesome teachers and I can assure you that you will have another kind of thinking after complete the course.
This  AWESOME course could help me to remove my bad character of learning process and methodology, actually I tough that my IQ is low since I have spend to much for study on my lessons but after watching course videos and see how our brain nerves system works I realized that not only my IQ is in good range but also I understand that I have creative memory.All in all this course is the best course that I had I my life and all of you should commence this course ass soon as possible.Thank you so much in deed Dr. Barbra Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
I have always been curious about how to learn effectively, so I frequently read a lot on related topics. Despite this, I still learn so many new interesting topics in this course! All of them not only cover concept but help to explain on how to turn them into actions, which are very helpful.This course should greatly help students, but even if you aren't a student, I still believe it's beneficial as we all need to learn new things (especially in this world of rapid change).Highly recommend to give it a try! It's only 4-weeks long, truly worth it :)
thanks. This course makes me more confident in learning new things, to grow & change, to maximize using Coursera courses I am taking & will be taking. For all those involved in Coursera & this course, thank you soooo much for having worked so hard to make these courses accessible, as I am unable to further my formal education, but I can still learn by enrolling in Coursera. Coursera is a very powerful source for me to be more competitive in the workplace. And this course will enable me to absorb more knowledge & skills in my office or other fields.
This course has been an eye-opener on many levels. It really helped me put things in perspective as far as learning any subject is concerned. Some of the tips resonated with what I've been hearing about education & learning since my growing up days, but I wouldn't have known what my deficiencies/drawbacks had I not taken this course. This course made me reflect about myself & my methods. As Prof. Oakley has stressed in this course, "One has to take responsibility for his/her own learning" and I would highly recommend this course. Happy Learning !!!
This course is such a helpful course for those who want to delve in deeper in cognitive psychology while learning new ways in how to learn more efficiently. It's a great course and the instructors are the type of professors you can easily get along with. It's an easy four week course and I highly recommend this as a first course for the first timers as it will be a good reminder that learning isn't just about reading books or making notes. It's also how you put that knowledge in your life and how to deeply ingrain it in one's mind for a long time.
It was such a pleasure to be in Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski's MOOC. I feel sad that I've finished the course, but I have already put holds on Dr. Oakley's books and currently reading one. The way she writes and the way she lectures is the same - engaging, funny, and thought-provoking. Thank you for this course, I have already begun to change my thoughts as advised in one of the lessons, and it has been doing wonders for me every day. The techniques mentioned here are applicable to everything that I do and not just in the classroom. Thanks again!
This course was one of those life-changing moments for me. At the end of my first degree, I felt that the learning methods I used were not effective enough, and I wanted to know better. I stumbled upon this course and the rest is history. It really changed my learning, and I feel much more confident now about my abilities and about my future learning. I would also like to thank the instructors, and professor Barbara Oakley in particular, for providing a supportive learning environment, that inspires the students to believe in themselves and grow.
This course is so intriguing. As a Psychology major during my undergraduate studies, the content presented in it really brought me back to what I've been learning in my courses. In addition to this, the analogies that the professors used to illustrate examples of concepts really made it easier for me to grasp the content of the course. It really rocks. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone who want to take an online course or just want to improve the way they learn. Go Coursera! Go McMaster University! Go University of California San Diego!
It is Must do course for all to understand how well we can harness the power of brain to learn better and effectively any subjects. They have given lots of practical and interesting suggestions to improve our learning. They are so simple techniques that we do sometime unknowingly or saw someone doing it, but we ignore it most of the time. Now that we can see what they do actually to our learning , we ca kind of hack the mid to learn the stuff we need. I am still doing the course and finding it interesting .. i will surely recommend it to others .
I would like to thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for putting together such a wonderful class.The great techniques put forth from test taking to tips on avoiding procrastination, to the memory palace for remembering lists and focusing on process and not on results were were very well put forward  in this class.I am a 60 year old adult, who has lost  complete faith that she can read and learn.  This class has given me courage to move on and has given me a great sense of accomplishment. And has also taught me a lot along the way.
Amazing courseIt's tips on memory, how to beat procrastination, and the use of focused and diffuse attention modes, as well as the diferences between working memory and long term memory and how they work, without forgetting the best ways of learning and the not so effective common practices called illusions of competence really were very helpful ideas that I'm decided to review them in spared days of the week to best retain them in my mindThanks to the team that made this possibleand a special thanks to Barbara and Terrence.Cheers from Brazil :)
From where to begin,Well this course by far exceeded my expectations. It changed my way of thinking (gradually not suddenly) and the way I receive things.It helps me see things from a big picture like for example if you're struggling with material , it is not the end of the world , you just have a good sleep and come back tomorrow in which you would find the material much easier . It helps you tackle procrastination and memory issues and addresses you with simple yet power techniques you can master subject.Thank you Barabara,I loved her so much
I am so happy I learned about this course after listening to Dr. Barbara Oakley interview with Matt Bodnar at the podcast The Science of Success. I am a reentry, transfer student about to start one of my biggest challenges, a BS degree in Cognitive Science with emphasis in Neuroscience. This course provided me with research based techniques that I am sure will be extremely helpful and positively impact my future grades and study life. Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this fascinating course. I highly recommend it!
This course is very useful and practicable despite of some obvious things at the beginning and not very useful 'additional videos'. I have already started to apply the knowledge I received during this wonderful course and I will, certainly, pass this knowledge to my relatives and friends to enhance their ability to learn and be smarter. Thank you very much Barbara and Teren! Thank you very much entire team who took part in organization of the course and definitely big 'thank you' to Coursera for such marvelous opportunities in online studying!
This was a very good course. I think it is accessible to a  very wide audience ranging from high schoolers to doctorates. Even people with high education and a lot of studying behind can learn studying tips from this course. The presentation is geared more towards wider audiences. However, the more reading -sections and references are exceptionally well written and detailed, and provide a great starting place for those willing to delve more deeply in the subject.I warmly recommend this course to anyone wanting to improve their learning skills!
This course is very informative and practical - you can start improving your learning immediately after watching the first video. In fact, the first impression was that the course was very easy and it presented many obvious things. But in hindsight, after revising all the material, trying to summarise it in the final project and understanding what amount of work must have been done for this course to appear... I can only say that this course is remarkable. Huge gratitude to Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team!
" Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects ", Course has changed my perception with regard to Learning and thrown light on various aspects namely Focus & Diffuse modes; Pomodoro Technique; Procrastination & Memory; Understanding; Illusion of Competence; Chunking; Team Work; Imposter Syndrome; Metaphor & Analogy; Test taking Tips etc.Henceforth, I will apply the techniques in a systematic and planned way to crack the tough subjects.Suggest the Teaching fraternity to pursue this course for better teaching.
This is a really helpful course.  I think it's easy to assume that you already know the optimal strategies for learning effectively, but this is probably not the case for most people. This class will teach you those strategies.The instructors are pretty wonderful, and make digesting the material easy and fun (I suppose, being experts in learning, they would tend to be good at teaching :) ). Since taking the course, I've integrated its techniques into my life, like the pomodoro and spaced repetition (among other strategies). Highly recommend.
It was a great experience learning how to learn. Thanks this course I found where I am doing wrong and actually I´am learning new things easier and time after time I repeat the information that I have studied some years ago. I used to consider the fact that I am interested in many different things as a problem and all these years I was searching to find something I really like most to succeed but thanks to Barbara I learned that you can start learning anything even the things you are not good at, just by efficient study. Thank you very much!
Thank you dear Instructors for making a surrounding where I can learn, explore and most importantly learn how to learn. I would like to appreciate Coursera for providing such an extraordinary environment which help me come across courses which enhances my potential and make me happier as ever. I want to express gratitude to the entire team which makes this course possible. Sincere apology for not proving any helpful review which can make this course more productive than it is up to now. I hope you deliver more and more courses such as this.
What an amazing and beneficial journey this has been!  I learned about this course from Anthony Metivier at the Magnetic Memory Method, and checked out Barbara Oakley's A Mind for Numbers as well.  The concepts and learning methods outlined in this course and the book are easy to understand and I am already seeing the benefits in my life.  The optional material is amazing as well, with thought provoking articles and videos about learning and memory.  I will be coming back to Learning How to Learn in order to keep my mind sharp.  Thank you!
An absolute life changing course. The depth and quality of material and knowledge shared along with all the various techniques to apply, I feel anybody is capable of achieving their goals and ambitions. Barbara Oakley is such a fantastic lecturer who uses the right tone of voice, mannerism and body language to engage the learner. I found myself so motivated to complete the course and have purchased both the recommended books, "Mind for Numbers- Barbara Oakley, and How things Work- Louise Bloomfield. Take up the course and change your life.
This wonderful course helps me find out which learning strategies are the best for me, and it also gives me a chance to review and self-evaluate how efficient my present learning styles are. The professional knowledge Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and Dr. Barbara Oakley  share in the course is indeed invaluable. The time I have spent for the course is truthfully worthy. Great thanks to  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski ,  Dr. Barbara Oakley and all the participants who have dedicated noble contribution  to make this course available for worldwide learners.
Good and short manageable course. You can work it through with not much time on your hand and if you want to deepen your understanding of the subject there is a lot of optional recourses to work through. The not optional content is cut down to its most important information.The two instructors are really passionate about their subjects and present it in an informative way assisted by analogies, mnemonics and multimedia.Only thing that is probably my preference is that Barbara Oakley talking feels slow, which can be adjusted by video speed.
This is amazing course not only for students, but for anyone who wants to learn anything new. Dr Barbara Oakley is amazing professor and her way of delivering lectures is so smooth and full of ease. Presentations and slides are just perfect and it all makes it so easy to learn about "Learning". This course has personally benefited me in several ways. I have generally become more focused during my work and study hours.I recommend this as a 'Must learn' course for teachers, students and anyone else who wants to improve their learning skills.
The most important & valuable online course I've taken so far! Not only that I enjoyed every minute of it, and how incredible the structure was, I could easily apply those tips in my daily life and see fruits of my "smart" labor right away! And that's my tip for you, if you are new to this course: take it while simultaneously learning something else, or maybe preparing for some test, you'll be able to test these tricks and get yourself in the habit of learning in a smart way. Thank you so much Barbara & Terrence for teaching how to learn!
Do you know what the pomodoro technique is? It is very simple and will help you to hack procrastination. I have learned about it from this course. Learning how to learn was my treat with which I rewarded myself. It is that good. I love the newsletter from Barbara Oakley. The lectures are fantastic and the material is very well designed. There are interviews with very interesting and inspiring people. The skills you get from Learning how to learn are applicable in every area of life. I am only sorry it is over, so I'll try to translate it.
Learning How to Learn is full of little insights into how the brain works when it comes to learning. Once exposed, these insights appear obvious, as they explain multiple daily experiences.As we learn how the brain functions when it comes to learning, techniques that optimise its function are presented. These techniques can easily be incorporated in one's daily life and enhance learning effectiveness.This course gives one an arsenal of tools that turn learning into an activity with clear control and hooks for optimising its effectiveness.
Fantastic Course. Definietly I changed my thinking pattern and the way look into my problems and learning completely changed. I believe through out the years I have done and gone through the completely wrong pathway. I had to make lot of efforts to get through my exams and now I know the reason. If I listen to this vedios earlier I may be a different person with lot of achievements. I do think every teacher, professor, lecturer , student should do this course. Can't even imagine that such a world class course is available free of charge.
In this course, "Learning How to Learn:  Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects," I learned some inner workings of cognitive processes associated with learning.  Many practical techniques were also presented, which I will utilize in future coursework and will also share with my colleagues.  The professors were interesting and gave information in logical sequences enabling easier recall.  Frequent quizzes also supported the acquisition of new ideas and concepts.  Many thanks to Drs. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski.
As I took this course, I realized if I could have taken it years ago, would have definitely helped me for my undergrads. The process of learning is so important, we are just focused on the product. I believe the techniques that I learned from this course will help me for my further studies, as learning never stops throughout the life. I am planning to study Data Structure course for job interview, this course will help me for my career growth. Thanks to the teachers for creating this wonderful course and I loved your presentation skill.
Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have been my best mentors to date. The way the whole course has been designed with its contest, tests, quizzes, assignments - everything has been designed to practice what is been taught, put it to practical application, learn from the mistakes, and ace better. I have been applying the techniques to my life now and it has made a remarkable difference with the way I use my time. Learning has turned far more efficient! Thank you so much for this well-designed course! It has changed my life!!!
An excellent summary of the latest research into how we learn. As well as introducing the theory the learning approaches and tactics presented make it a highly practical course. Although I'm now past the stage of formal education, I'm still finding applying the skills I've learned in this course very useful in my approach to learning new skills, whether at work or at home. I would highly recommend this course to anyone, whether in school, college or university, or like me just looking to continue learning in your job and personal life.
This course is well structured and grabs your interest from the beginning. If you go through the course, you learn some valuable learning techniques, as well as methods for fighting the procrastination and overcoming the frustration that sometimes we all get.I was already using some of the highlighted methods of learning, but I did not know that there were some special techniques that are proved to be more effective to learn something new. The course helped me to see the studying process from new perspective and make it more conscious.
The learning techniques and how the brain works that can be learned from this course is very insightful. I particularly like the mnemonic and memory palace techniques because I want to improve my memory and creativity. I tried applying some of the techniques into my studies and I can say that I have retained what I learned better because I am less stressed due to sufficient sleep and the diffused mode of thinking as the course has taught. The things taught here can even be applied to lifelong learning, so overall, it's a great course!
This course touched on a plethora of researched material that, if applied, will undoubtedly make your learning more effective. The knowledge and tools that this course has shared will, without a doubt, make my journey in life much more enriching. As humans, we are curious, and through curiosity, we learn and create new synapses in our minds. Having taken a course that assists in effectuating this learning process will prove priceless in the days ahead. Thank you, Dr. Barbara Oakley  & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, for creating such a course
I very much recommend taking this course. It presents basic neuroscience topics as they relate to learning, memory and test taking in a simple and approachable way. It also encourages you to reflect often throughout the course so that you think of ways to apply the concepts to your own experiences. The instructor is an expert and is a great speaker that keeps you engaged. I enjoyed listening to the videos while driving my car, and because of the course's good structure and assessments, feel I internalized much of the information well.
I have had a medical doctorate for almost 30 years and have always considered myself a very  poor student; avid reader, avid learner- but a poor student. Now it is amazing to me to discover that not only was I correct, but that there are some very concrete, evidence based, efficient and simple methods by which to become an excellent student. Time spent has always been important, but the opportunity to make any time spent well worth the investment is invaluable. Truly excellent course, that I have already and will continue to recommen
Throw out your old ideas about learning and studying!   No more cramming, re-reading, or excessive highlighting.  Bring on the self-testing, deliberate practice, and interleaving.  And don't forget to get some descent sleep and exercise, too.The concepts I learned through this class are already paying dividends for me.  The material is presented in short video segments that allow time for your brain's diffuse mode to help you along.  I also browsed through the optional interviews and readings which are excellent.  Highly recommended!
This course provides phenomenally powerful tools for improving your ability to learn, as well as a deeper understanding of the best available models for how our brains work. All of the material is backed by scientific research, which is well-cited throughout the course. The instructors are both entertaining and informative, creating a really great learning environment. I have recommended this course to all of my friends, though I can't recommend it highly enough. You owe it to yourself to make this the next course that you complete.
After 50 years of learning there is still much to learn about how to learn!  This course describes some of the brain's mechanisms related to learning and prescribes tips and methods to overcome frequently encountered impediments to learning; such as procrastination, over-learning, einstellung, illusions of competence, etc.  Presented in a joyous style by Dr's Oakley, and Sejnowski, makes you want to dust off the old Calculus text to see what you missed the first time around.  Wonderful for the wide-eyed young and the young at heart!
The two Drs. Oakley and Seg were perfect, no distracting mannerism or verbal quirks. I like there slow mature deliveries and how the projected verbal content was totally in sync with the graphics content. The voluntary readings at the conclusion of a week's material were insightful and force multiplier to the course. Please keep that feature. As I intend to take advantage of my work furlough during Covid the tools of Learning How to Learn were the right mix before starting a more ambitious learning routine going forward. Thank you!
The course provides powerful strategies to get your mind where you want it to be in an effort to realize your personal and professional goals. Tools and resources are in abundance as well. Learn how to learn, and specifically, learn how YOU learn, so that you can set yourself up for the successes we crave. The above is a pre-made paragraph that I felt no need in changing because it's all true. I desired mental tools to help me learn and find consistency and discipline in my successes. Thank you for the wealth of knowledge provided!
I am a university student in my fourth year. I suffered from forgetting what I spent years learning. When I presented this problem to my friends, I was recommended by one of them to this course and it was really an enjoyable experience. Now I am more able to remember the things I am learning and finally I loved Dr. Barbara Oakley she was more than a friend she felt me as i'm home. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski was totally academic i felt it in this way but it was also interesting since i still an academic student so it felt me comfortable
This is perhaps one the most useful and essential course that I have came across. This is for everyone who wants to and love to learn things not just for the sake of doing it but for understanding the nuances of it and making it permanent. I could appreciate many ideas from this course those I were already practicing in studies and made me think of ideas I were lacking while I used to study. I am definitely going to apply as much approaches mentioned in this course as possible in my studies. Thanks for making a such a good course.
I have recently received an EdD in adult education and as a result have learned a lot of theories of adult learning. This course really enlightened me to the biology of learning and helps me better understand the ``why`` of the theories and how many of them, seemingly unrelated on the surface, really complement each other.  I appreciate they way the content was delivered, in a straight forward, easy to understand format which helps us to master the material quickly and apply it to our lives. Thank you Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski!!!
I really want to congratulate you for this interesting and useful course for the life of each one of the people who take it. In my case personally, if I would like to certify myself, but I do not have the resource and believe me that the effort I had to make to do it was quite great, since I have to take care of my parents who suffer from Alzheimer's and I don't really have time left, but This same course made me correct some things in my daily life and so I could organize myself better and did my best to finish them. Thank you!
This is the first time to learn by MOOCs, it is a great thing I've done, because I've benefited more than I imagine, and I found my passion here and have known more information that enable me to learn.I'm so happy that this course is my beginning.according to Dr. Barbra, I did love her way to explain the material, I see she does her best to produce this course to the fullest.Dr. Sejnowski , I did benefited from all you teach us and hope to learn more from you in the next courses.Thanks all Doctors who contributed to this course.
I have tried to finish this course about two years ago ,but it is a pity that I didn't stick to it because there is just so many temptation and excessively abundant time in my college life. Now I have entered the society as a primitive engineer  and I have much less free time in my daily life, which actually inspires me to take advantage of my time. I would treat this course's finishing as a new starting point of my life. Like the last interview said, write your own autograph, and I would try to make it as brilliant as possible.
This course was extremely helpful for me, although I'm already familiar with a lot of concepts and researches about learning. It's well structured and sometimes sims to be to precise, but then it's become obvious, that it follows all the tips it's talking about. So now that I finished it, it's impact on my learning is a matter of practice)It's also very inspiring to see all of the personal examples (see additional interviews), especially from Dr.Barbara Oakley, since I also didn't expect that I would study math-related subjects.
I am a medical student struggling to find the proper technique to engrave all the dense information Medical School has to offer into my core, and that played a toll on me. I knew the problem was not in myself, but my techniques, so I decided I need to spend some time on improving my demolished ways. I had little expectations starting this course, as it was the first online course I had ever started, but I was taken by the quality and style of presenting this information. I had my doubts, but this course was up for the challenge.
Are you a procrastinator? Participate in this course when you should be doing your "real" classes or work. Even if you're an expert in all the latest productivity hacks, you'll learn the biological reasons behind such subjects as putting things off and why you may not be learning even though you're covering all the material. Once completed, you can apply what you've learned and get down to more efficient learning.Additionally, it seems that the professors do a good job of keeping the course updated and communicating to students.
This is the first course that I was able to finish due to the interesting topics and the way they are delivered. While I am already a 30-year old professional, all ideas here will help me be a more productive individual optimizing my learning from all that I read and experience. My only regret is not taking this earlier. Even the optional videos are must-see. I recommend this to everyone that are in Coursera to include this on the first courses that they take here. Thank you very much, Dr. Barbara Oakley. I would want a part 2.
This is an excellent course. I learned new techniques to help me study any subject such as chunking, using metaphors and how exercise and sleep are more important than we think when learning new and difficult subjects. I especially enjoyed the different videos from renowned experts in memory retention, brain function and other related videos.  I learned about the focused and diffused mode of thinking and how shifting between the two helps you to think better, be more creative and solve problems. I highly recommend this course.
Excellent introduction (or review) of the physiology, psychology and techniques of learning, studying and test taking. The course content is very accessible and surprising comprehensive.I enjoyed the explanations of learning physiology as much as the discussion of specific learning strategies and techniques. The supplemental reading and videos are also very worthwhile.As an educator and constant student, I got a lot from the course and will take it again. I strongly recommend this course to all students, educators and parents.
Excellent course! Helps you to build up good learning habits and understanding what learning is. Personally I was familiar with many of the learning strategies that are being represent along the course, but together with the explanations of why are thous any good, and the organised way the material is being laid it helps you "chunk it" all together  , it did have a big impact on me. And it gave me a lot of motivation and already I feel that I am a better learner and more confidante. Thanks for helping me learning how to learn.
I am very thankful that I enlisted in this course. It allowed me to use my time and energy towards developing an essential skill in my life as a teacher. I learned many things from this course. I'm not only talking about theories and principles but actual practical lessons I can use in my daily tasks. This course gave me a fresh look on learning and hopefully will allow me to unlearn certain habits. I'm excited to use the tips in my work and share them with students and colleagues. It's worth my time and effort - yours, too!
Fantastic. Learned so much, despite having a Masters qualification and written a book. I've found ways to improve my learning and rekindled my love of learning - am really thinking about how to apply to my creative writing, but also it's nudged me back into taking up my Tibetan and Spanish learning again. I've used Pomorodo before, as an academic on a writing retreat, enjoyed it, then forgot about it. This course has confirmed - with me testing it in practice - that it really is an effective technique.Can't recommend enough.
Dear Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski ,I'd like to thank you for all sharing this very well made MOOC with the world.At the age of 35, I'm gearing up to going back to school o pursue my Master's and this course has got me excited to be studying again.I love the depth in the topics you've covered, the simple language with which you put across complex medical terms, the humor, the encouragement, the tips, and yes, the zombies.I will be back in some time to review this course again.Love and Gratitude,A STEM MOOC student from India.
The course shook my mind. First time ever, I thought about my problems as common problems. All the optional videos of such great personalities are insightful. I will never stop learning from Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. As a child, I had so many negative scripts that I never tried to do good. While doing the course, the tutors rewired my thinking pattern. I feel normal. I am enthusiastic to apply the knowledge. Also, I never wanted this course to end. It felt right to interact with such wonderful teachers.
This is an absolutely fantastic course in my opinion. I just realized that I have been utilizing extremely bad habits in my studying for so many years. The concepts that I found to be of great help to me are chunking, interleaving, and also the types of human memory (long-term memory, and working memory) as well as how our brains work in relation to procrastination. I highly recommend everyone who is taking the course, to make neat notes for each week, I found this advantageous in retaining much of the content. Peace & love
The course was well designed. I liked the structure of the course. Due to my procrastination problem, I enroll for the coursera courses now and then, but middle of the session I drop out from each of the course. This is the first in Coursera that retained my interest to finish the course. I loved the concept of Pomodoro, Chunking techniques that have been taught in this course. I'm looking forward to apply these techniques not only in my professional career but also in my life-long learning process. Happy learning everyone!
I'm a dyslexic and ADHD person. You can imagine how much I suffer from learning and memorizing things and I always suffer from studying and making exams and I hate going to school. This course taught me how to overcome my problem in studying and to memorize things easily It makes me more confident with myself. I found myself going thru the material easily and confidently doing the practice exams.  I wish I had this course before. I'm 63 years old. Thank you for the marvelous course. I definitely will recommended to my kids
This course was a big learn and life changer. before taking this course I was unable to learn anything due to a not working pituitary. This course learned me how to be able to learn antything. Even better, this course does not only how to learn, but also how to learn very efficient. So now I'm able to follow multiple online courses at a time, thanks to this wonderfull course. I would strongly recommend this course to everybody, especially to those that have problems with concentration or do not have much time for learning.
This was such a helpful course! It gave me tactical tools to change my perspective on learning. I'm  much more confident in my study skills, and have awesome tools to combat procrastination and ineffective study habits, and build awesome new ones to help me actually hold onto the new knowledge that I'm studying to pursue a career change. Huge thank you to the instructors and Coursera for offering this for free, as well. I will definitely be reading  and learning more from Barbara Oakley. 5 stars  from a grateful student :)
I've always had trouble procrastinating on classwork and studying for tests. After taking this course it really gave me some powerful mental tools that I've never known about, my favorite is the Pomodoro technique and focusing on the process rather than the product. This course really has helped me with my procrastination and has actually helped me look forward towards studying. I highly recommend this course to anyone that is looking to fix their procrastination habits and looking for new effective ways to learn subjects.
Just Exceptional. The sincerity of both professors to provide us all the learning skills and techniques that helped to become who they are was done in a very skillful and comprehensive manner. I wish I would have found this course a bit earlier so that I could have used it during undergrad, and taken out all those preconceptions away about learning things that I felt would be out of my scope in general. Anyhow, better late than never as I always say. Thank you for this, and looking forward to taking more MOOCs as this one.
I highly appreciate having the opportunity of taking this course.  The concepts and techniques I have learnt so far have helped me really improved in my University life as a student and in my work as an En glish teacher.  I have taken so long to be able to finish it, but I have also taken my time to double check the video-lessons and take notes, so I can better understand.  My purpose is to complete the whole course because I do not know what other wonderful experiences are awaiting to be discovered.  Thank you very much.
I enjoyed this course very much. Professors are passionate about learning, have a genuine interest in teaching and are cool. You will have a good time taking this course. It's packed with a lot of resources with a lot of useful and interesting information but you will not feel the time pass by if you want to improve your learning skills and want to know more about the whole learning process, which is very interesting. Highly recommended for everyone! What you will learn here is useful in every field for your entire life.
Learning How to Learn is without a doubt the most pleasant, interesting, and useful online course I've taken to date. Both instructors are engaging and lively, the material is presented in straightforward and clever manners, and it achieves the balance between technical background information and practical techniques.I would heartily recommend Learning How to Learn to anyone from high school students looking to improve their grades through to adult learners returning to education after an absence and EVERYONE in between.
I have been struggling with my studies since I got admitted into university but couldn't find out where the root of all problems is. Now, I have come to know about how my brain works and how it can be managed to do things. I wish I will be able to apply what I have learned in this course. Believe it, it was worthy of time to waste in such a course that won't help you to earn your payscale directly but it will bring a major mind-shift to believe in yourself when you will get to know where you lacked and what do you need.
I found this course for my 12-year-old daughter.  She is starting to get classes that depend on tests for the grade, and she was really unclear how to study effectively.  I decided to take the course also, and my 6-year-old son, who is highly motivated, participated with me.  I got some key benefits from the course, particularly the pomodoro technique, which I am using.  The side benefit to doing this "as a family" is that it gives us a vocabulary and common experience around which to discuss learning concepts together.
Really helpful, while learning the course, I recalled of many words that my teachers told me when I was at school. Such as look at the last few questions (the most difficult ones) first during an exam, and recall what I've learnt after each course, they were really helpful, but back then I couldn't understand very clearly so didn't try hard on them. But now I know, and I become more confident with these 'tricks' and become more willing to control my learning process to make it more efficient and enjoyable.Thanks a lot.
This course is amazing! It really explains the topic in depth and you learn a lot from both professors! This course also provides a lot of practical information and you know that it's evidence based. It's definitely worth the time and effort to watch all the videos and I recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn something.  More important: This course is mainly focused on academics but it also links the knowledge to everyday learning (skills like cooking great dishes, learn a sport or any other skill really)
Great info, I also read the book to further interleave the learning. In the future I will definitely use techniques presented in this course. One little point of annoyance, for most of the tests, the multiple choose questions contain very clearly right and very clearly wrong answers. In my opinion this makes the effectiveness of taking those tests much less. I think this is a missed opportunity since this course itself speaks so highly about the value of serious test taking. But overall I'm very happy with the course.
I felt it was mainly fun, and I did talked about the principles and interviews I've seen during the course, so I guess something about the course works!  :)Also, It helped me understand some of my behaviors (for good and bad) .There are a few things that were a bit...well...made me go somewhere else for a while during the course:1.It took me a while to get used to the lectures tempo. For me - they are a bit too slow.2.In many cases - the answers for the question were long. From time to time - It was really exhausting.
Through this course I learned about the mechanics of the learning, techniques for learning better and also how to retain what we learn in our long-term memory.The course covers a wide range of topics such as procrastination, different thinking models, the importance of physical activity for your brain among many others.The course has the contribution of experts and scientists from different domains which I believe that contributes for the overall quality of the program.I highly recommend everyone to take this course!
I found it an amazingly well organised course. It cut no corners. A spade was called a spade. Most things we know but it's good when its re-enforced and we are made to face reality - illusions of competence. We fool ourselves so easily. Its hard hitting and extremely beneficial. I particularly liked the palace technique. It took me a while to actually understand but it was quite astounding how it worked once put into practices.It was a great course and I am glad I got so much out of it. Thanks to Babara and Terence.
The course is very intrinsic in its teaching and i would most definitely recommend to nay student starting out either in their academic career or simply considering one in the near future. Even if it might not be education purposes, it can also be for job as it was in my case. Unfortunately, it was too late on my end, but I look to making changes in the future as advised by my peers in this course. It will teach the reason why slowing down is very important and vital to undertaking as well as mastering of concepts.
Absolutely game changing stuff! I always was curious about  figuring out a set of principles that will make my learning more efficient. I used to avidly read the Learning on Steroids material by Scott Young. Although I had known much of the stuff taught on this course, I never had the right structure to put all this in perspective. The much-needed structure is  what this course gave me. I'm currently a broke entrepreneur. But, when the time comes, I want to buy this course as a token of thanks. Thank you, Coursera!
It is true that there is a broad applicability of the concepts 
presented in the videos.  Using scientific data and concrete examples to
 illustrate points, the instructors truly delivered.  As a medical student, I find this course really worth investing into.  I
 still am amazed of the things I've learned about learning.  I am 
surprised at how much time and energy I've wasted before studying 
inefficiently.  No wonder I'm burned out time and again.  It was 
delightful embarking on this ship.  Thank you very much!
Highly recommend to take this as your first MOOC course. Very easy to understand, all topics discuss are presented in an easy, painless manner. The professors have very informative and brief video lectures, and taking the questions and quizzes right after the lectures is very helpful in staying engaged without using up too much of your time. This is coming from a person who has had a hard time with going to school, so the result is very good. Hopefully the other classes are as good and to the point as this one was.
An original, interesting, well organized course that sums up many tools that you can casually find on the internet when you get frustated about not learning effectively what you want to learn. It gives useful tips to become a good learner (boosting your morale!) and a fundamental explanation of our neurological processes. Barbara Oakley is a pleasure to listen to! Thanks!PS. Just a small criticism to improve: 1) tests little challenging 2) optional interviews are nice but usually generalistic despite being so long
I loved this course. The instructors were so encouraging and positive about what they taught. Thye gave great information but it did not come across as "lecturing." By giving examples from their own lives it made the lessons so much more meaningful and also gave me ways to remember some of the learning lessons shared. I wish I had this course many years ago it would have saved me so much time. I eventually self learned some of the information shared here. Hearing it now was so validating and empowering. Thank you!
This is an essential course to understand a bit clearer how to learn new concepts and more important, how our brain works and how we can maximize its performance.

Both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski master all the subjects taught, and it's remarkable the passion they show in the different videos and the useful optional interviews.

I can only highly recommend this video to those who want to improve their capabilities regarding memory, thinking or best understanding and brain performance in general.
Great and simple-to-follow course. It teaches you very useful techniques to improve your learning and tackle procrastination, with day-to-day examples and metaphors. Even though part of the course is presented in a simple and intuitive language, some lectures will go deeper in psychological and neuro-scientific explanations to  let you better understand how the brain works regarding learning.  A must do course for every passionate learner who's willing to optimize his time and effort when approaching new concepts.
This class will help you think about learning in new ways because (1) it includes recent findings on brain structure and processes (2) it provides concrete tactics for learning more effectively and (3) the teacher grappled with having to rewire her own brain early in career. So, she serves as both proof of the power of the process - and inspiration. She is just so darn NICE. She really wants people to take control of their learning and their lives.  By the time the course is over, you just want to make her proud.
I knew that this course was one of the most popular courses in personal development genre but the course surpassed my expectations. I began to think learning as a fundamental activity in my daily life rather than simple techniques when facing exams and tough subjects. There are many books on study methods and how to learn effectively but so far, the lecturer is the only one who was successful in connecting the daily life with learning. I believe my notes that I took over the course will be valuable for some time.
Fantastic course. One should make it mandatory to all university professors and would be great for high students and first year university students. I am planning on integrating it into my teaching and presenting some of the ideas and techniques discussed in the course to my students on each class. I have tried a few other courses on Coursera and this course seems truly exceptional: the way the material is structured, presented and you can really feel the enthusiasm of the course instructor. Thank you very much.
Great course! There's so much in here that can help college students, professionals, or lifelong learners on how to better themselves and grasp new concepts or ideas. I'm excited to apply this to future courses on writing, social media, and health. I especially appreciated hearing about the best ways to study and the best ways to retain information -- I've always heard that 10,000 hours of practice was important but this course really laid out why! And gave helpful tips + strategies on how to master a subject.
This course includes many practical tips that are backed by research especially in psychology and neuroscience. I have found the concepts of diffused mode of thinking, illusion of competition, working memory, chunking, Pomodoro, spaced repetition, habit steps, hard start, exercise, social sharing and a good night of sleep very helpful. I'm not a student anymore, but as an engineer in the world of fast-paced technology, I'm confident these concepts will help me keep abreast with new ways of thinking and skills.
Lots of nuggets of good information backed with practical advice about how to implement them to your benefit. The explanations of the learning process also help you understand what you (perhaps) are going through currently in coursework, or in your professional lifeHonestly, these teachings should be brought up early in someone's academic career, and most beneficially when someone has taken on an independent learning mindset for maximum effect. Since you're on Coursera, that's probably you, so take this class!
Very helpful. I'd been thinking of myself as a quick learner for years and found it a mere illusion during this course. It points out that my over-learning in a specific area fooled me and hence myself stuck somewhere. The question 'why am i not making any progress along the career path even if I'm learning quickly' now never frustrates me.This course has more than just pointing out this illusion. Invaluable advice of learning will obviously help me for the rest of my life, at least 40 years as I'm expecting:P
Excellent course, 2016 is going to be a very challenging year form me as I have
to perform in new role in my job. And I have enrolled in a one full year
course.  As I have limited time, I need use my time effectively with
better learning techniques. 100% satisfied, I will highly recommend this course to every one as learning is
every day job. Now I am doing physical exercise every day, preparing task
lists and more importantly I am using spaced recitation. Thanks to trainers and the Coursera team. Great job!!!
First course on Coursera I completed all the way. Excellent instructors and very valuable advice. Anyone can benefit from this course, no matter their age, profession, or interests.Learning about how your mind works was the most valuable thing I gained from this course. It added meaning and context to all the learning techniques that were explained, so that everything made sense. This is also a very well researched course.  All the information presented is backed up by numerous references to scientific papers.
I really really love this course i'm dam sure it will change my life as well as gives me a fire wing to fly i am relay glad such a wonderful teacher's teach me as well as host share their real experience.I wanna to specially thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski  who thought me so uniquely. If  i'll be coming in US for further studies i will definitely meet both of them and ask for wonderful dinner with me. Thank you so much coursera for such wonderful cources,with lot's of love....fare well
It's an amazing course! Teachers are very friendly, it's a pleasure to see them and to listen to them. There's also a lot of great additional information like interviews, articles, books, etc. I've found a lot of new information about learning and I've started to use that information. I feel more confident now and I've started to enjoy the process of learning in a new way. And I've already recommended this course to some of my friends and colleagues!All in all, it's the best course I've ever been enrolled to!
This was truly a learning ride. I got to experience many different ways to improve my learning. Not only that, but the course also helped me point out why some of the learning techniques that I have been using don't work(Excessive highlighting is one of them). Besides the regular course material, the optional interviews were revelational. Inspired by Benny Lewis, I have started to learn Spanish. I want to thank the instructors and the people who helped create this brilliant course. Kudos for a job well done.
Terrific! THANK YOU! Awesome! This excellent course outlines from A to Z all you wish you had known about learning before going to school. I really appreciate the vast body of knowledge presented in the course: neuroscience, science, art, psychology, philosophy, writing, humanitarian. This course is a multidisciplinary approach on the topic of learning, not just learning a specific field, but learning in general. Very useful. Highly recommend. My tremendous appreciation to Dr. Barbara Oakley. Happy learning!
This is a great course! it is a very good option to gain life long learning tools. Besides, it was very useful for me to tackle some learning problems I had, like procrastination or reading problems. It also provides good tips on how to manage your stress before taking a test and on how to improve your learning, all from a scientific basis! I like a lot the lectures of Dr. Barbs Oakley, she is a very good professor. I enjoyed a lot listening to her videos. Thank you team for this good course! Happy Learning!
I really did enjoy taking the course. I learned a lot about how to tackle procrastination, how to prepare for and take tests. I learned new way's of thinking, and learned about focus and diffused modes. I could go on. Taking this course will help me in my college classes and it will also help decrease my anxiety about taking tests, procrastinating and studying. I also feel confident that I will have success in college if I apply what I've learned from this course. Thank you very much for offering this class!
The takeaways from this course are of practical benefit to learning and mastering a subject. Be it a technical or a creative. As the title suggests, it is a vital prerequisite to any subject you wish to study. A consequence of completed this course is a complete review of the choices I have been making on a day to day level regarding learning. It is time to switch out the bad habits and install the new ones that I have both learned and been convinced of on this course. It might just change your outlook too.
I think anyone would benefit from the course *as a place to start* because it provides a great quick overview of available tools and strategies. I wish there was a part to the course which puts all this strategies into practice by really driving the point home that this or that particular technique really works. It would be easy for example to to have people memorize a 20 item grocery list using Memory Palace or delight students with fun and clever metaphors to teach a rather complicated scientific concept.
I rate this course a BILLION STAR. This is by far one of the best and most brilliant course i have taken with an life changing impact. lately i being a senior Technical professional was struggling with procrastination, Illusion of incompetence, Einstellung and almost all negative symptoms discussed in this course. [Yes,I learned all the above terminology from this course] . With the mitigation techniques shared,i am resolute to change my life.Lots of Love and Respect for you Prof. Barbara and Prof. Terry .
I enjoyed this course enormously. It made me rethink many fallacies about learning that I have believed. I feel inspired to not only improve my understanding of my current chosen field, but to branch out into other disciplines in order to expand the way in which my brain can creatively solve problems. I wish that I had this course as a resource when I was still in high school. But here we are, 30 years old and ready to get my learn on in a far more meaningful way than I had previously thought was possible.
one of the best courses, and those where I retained a lot of the information. A lot of relevance to so many aspects of life, not only learning. The teaching methods are great, including the sequence, the illustrations, and the exams. I finished it, including the extra -tasks within 12 days, but I had some spare time to use.Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are great teachers who delivered it in an eye opening way that will affect my approach to many things in life, most importantly, how I guide my kids to learn!
One of the best courses I have ever taken! Both the faculty members have ensured that all the learning techniques we have learnt through the course are emphasized scientifically. I am so happy to have chosen the right course on the ways of learning. I strongly recommend this course for learners of all ages. This would pave the way for lifelong learning among all avid learners. I, wholeheartedly, place on record my sincere gratitude to both the faculty members for providing an enriched learning experience!
This is an engaging and entertaining presentation of current research concerning learning that offers practical tools for every learner.  The "bonus" videos are fascinating interviews, right to the last one, and the "honours" assignments are excellent opportunities to test and demonstrate one's mastery of the subject.  Congratulations are due to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the Coursera team for creating a course that offers a clear overview, specific details and useful, essential learning strategies.
I really enjoyed this course! Dr. Oakley has such a great way of explaining concepts and it was such a pleasure taking this class. I learned so much about how to learn and a lot of it was completely new to me. I have started to implement what I've learned and it has already drastically changed the quality of my learning. I especially love the Memory Palace technique and I still remember lists I memorized weeks ago! That is just phenomenal. Thank you for such an awesome class! I recommend this to everyone.
This is the best course which helps to understand how you can learn in better way. How you can manage stress. This is great course for anyone regardless of age and what subject anyone want to learn. I would suggest this course should be mandatory before taking any new skill course as it will give you confidence as well as technique using which you can learn the material quickly as well as master the subject in no time. Thank you very much Dr. Barbara Oakley. Appreciate your effort to build up this course.
As an educator, I am glad that I took up this well -structured Modules. Thanks to amazing and in-depth work done by the team. Barbara Oakley has a natural flair and explained very well, easy to follow her well though out interviews with some amazing intellectuals will remain with me as inspiration. I am also in awe of Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and his explanation about the working of a complex machine called the brain. Thanks to the well-developed course it has added value to my learning and worth the time.
In a very calm, clear and warm way, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski give a very helpful and practical insight into how our brain learns and many techniques and tricks to tackle the many problems (both external and internal) one can face during the learning process, whatever complexity of the subject at hand.I have personally and immediately benefited of what I learned in this course and I highly recommend it to anyone strugling with the learning process, whatever the age or the academic experience. Thanks!!
When I started this course, I wasn't expecting something that I didn't already know. I have watched several YouTube videos on how to learn and understand better, along with a lot of articles on this topic, but as I progressed along the course, I was surprised at how much I DIDN'T know about the right way to learn. I'm glad I chose this course and it's a course I'll definitely recommend to my friends!I loved the optional videos and I suggest everyone taking this course to not miss those! Happy Learning :D
The videos are really well structured, they catch your attention and proceed to explain the concept of it. The quiz at the end of them gives a perfect chance to recall the topic reviewed, and they are not hard quizes, sometime they are funny to answer!And although the weekly test may seem a little sraight forward, you make sure you've learned all the logic in the explanations.Really good course, my thanks (and congrats) to both Instructors on the efford putted on it, had a really good time finishing it.
I wish I knew this course before I started my high school or freshmen in the university year so I could build my knowledge and ability to learn more and not just learned to pass tests.  This should be a curriculum as fundamental for students to learn the fact that they can do everything. Tips and techniques such as Pomodoro, how to access your diffuse mode, how important of sleeping, use metaphor or analogy, change your thoughts / shifting your thinking, a test checklist,  and hard start - jump to easy,
Very Good Course!The feeling of this course is like a punch in the face. The image of this course in my head is two gurus in learning saying "Boy, learn in this way" with a smile and pointing to a mysterious and exciting trod.I've failed several tests after entering university. Feeling desperate this summer holiday. I began to realize the problem was my learning attitude and methods. By learning this course and applying it in studying ,I feel more confident when take a test or doing study for a project.
Learning How to Learn was an excellent stepping stone for taking control of my own education. I am excited to go back to college and use the tools I've learned in courses and life in general. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone looking to become a better, more engaged learner. Excellent all the way through and it was neat how they used their own findings and implemented them into the course structure. It really helped cement the ideas in my brain for future use while proving their effectiveness.
I loved this course so much.  I found it to be highly valuable in so many aspects.  It is a wealth of information & brings context to the information provided.  I understood many topics from previous areas in my life or areas or study, but I loved how much recall that was impressed upon me throughout the course.  I am absolutely going to be looking into the recommended books and I really enjoyed the optional videos, interviews, and readings. Thank you so much to everyone involved in making this happen.
Good course!Quite easy to get into as most of the concepts described are common for everybody, so you can easily map it to your own struggles with learning.Systematised pieces of knowledge about how our brain works in the context of studying new things. Nice section of optional interviews with a handful advices.As I got it latter it is based on "A Mind of Numbers" book by Barbara Oakley, which has most and even more material, so I would highly recommend that book reading as part of the course syllabus.
I have spent quite a number of years in classrooms (have a PhD, studies music and several languages) and I had not heard of so many of the concepts presented in this course.After being a professional for ~10 years and getting the feeling that I was getting stuck, I took this course cause it seemed the perfect place to restart learning. It totally did. I now have a good understanding on how we learn and will use the techniques from this course not only to continue to learn, but to do job related tasks.
I used this as a review of learning techniques after a few years of being away from school. Although a few topics are geared towards students with text, exams, and study groups, I think this was a great resource to help chart my solo course into learning skills for my new career. This course should be taught in elementary school when students first have to study and take tests and then repeated through life as a refresher and as our understanding of our brains advances. Thank you for making this free.
Great course. Too bad only a few could see its true value. As normal human being, we have learned a heck lot subjects in our lives before, but only a few have to come to a realization that 'learning' itself is a subject worth studying. Learning something new is not just a requirement to get a job, it's also a core function of being human. And if you do it right, you will have tremendous and life-lasting fun! Gratitude for Barb, Terry and Coursera team, for making this happen. You've done a superb job!
It is a very helpful course which in my opinion all people should take, even if you're in your 60s and finished college and took all the degrees you wanted 40 years ago. We keep learning all our lives till we die. It's amazing how many techniques I've learned from this course in studying and remembering things even remembering things in every day life. I've already used some techniques to tackle my procrastination and looking forward to use the remaining techniques and tricks in my studying and life.
Barbara and Terrence are the kind of teacher one misses from school in the best possible way.The matter is easy to grasp but not to teach, and they're able to communicate every lesson as if it was obvious in the most natural way.I don't really understand how this course might be free. It's changing my life and helping me with my procrastination better than any other thing I tried. The companion book is a memento to keep and review, as some of the videos and interviews.Thanks Barbara, thanks Terrence.
Its a great course to learn  how to learn ,even though to understand the brain functioning deeply is not so easy  ,where as here  the teachers presented the content much more easy to understand how to handle procrastination ,how to read efficiently and interestingly  using different techniques.i am glad i have enrolled this course .Please enroll the course and complete the course  you will fell much better while learning ,probably you will love it using the techniques suggested by the teachers here .
Powerful. This course opened my eyes to somethings that were maybe obvious, but whose deep and real meaning I never rationalized before.This course is taking method to studying, and supporting said method by science. The instructors are pleasantly easy to follow. They make the subject accessible to all students, even to those for whom English is not the first language, and content is just the second obstacle to overcome.You have procrastination, math/science learning issues? This is just your course!
Though this course was meant for students who prepare for exams and tests but I love learning new things so I took up this course. My main problem is procrastination. I am almost 50 yrs old now and I am happy to realize that by understanding the real logic behind procrastination I could work on cues and beliefs. This course has also helped me in guiding students who think they can not learn a particular subject. Interview videos are inspiring. Cheers for Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!
Course highly recomendable. Isn't just a course for learn a couple study-techniques but a great explanation of how your brain works in learning any topic. The material in this course will help you to create your own "toolkit" of learning techniques. My best parts were how to deal with Procrastination and the biological factors of learning.Look at the optional videos, since they invited various high-perfomers that complement with practical advice what you'll learn a long the course.Happy learning : )
This was the first Coursera class that I've ever taken, and I can say with complete honesty that I was thoroughly impressed with the content. I've learned so much, and can not wait to apply these new skills and strategies. Dr. Oakley is an excellent instructor, and her patient, calm demeanor made the videos a joy to watch. I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone - no matter your background, skill level, or motivations - take a few weeks to complete "Learning How to Learn." It will change your life.
Finally, I have completed this one. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand human learning process and wants to take a step further in understanding and learning any subjects or material. Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrance are awesome presenters, they have created a balance in between general and scientific understanding of human brain. This course has answered my so many question about human leaning experience. I found this course very helpful.. Now, I know what is mean by happy learning..
If you are stuck at any age (and I mean it. It doesn't matter if you are 8 or 80) or feel stagnant in your learning endeavors then take this course. You will have a great time with the instructors. Best of all if you have lots of free time and are scared of taking tests then this course will surely help you through. Or if you cannot comprehend the lessons in class this course will help you understand how you can improve.Take this course at any stage of your life. Happy learning until we meet again.
Throughout this course, I kept thinking of just how helpful this information would have been in middle school; I also became eager to share my experience with this course and encourage others (especially younger learners) to take it. This course is extremely easy to take, but also incredibly useful in presenting new study techniques, and reinforcing old ones. Although I highly recommend this course for younger learners, the material covered in this course would be beneficial to anyone at any stage.
I have two degrees and have taken several online courses and been a full-time life-long learner. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. It seems somewhat new in format, more focused on actual learning than any notion of grades, and by the end, thanks to the wonders of the Internet interface, there was a new, or rather several new features in my inner life that I had more or less painlessly learned. I've recommended this to many people, my children have done it; your course is a true gift.
Very helpful methodology for learning based on proven techniques backed by scientific research.  Material is presented in a creative and very digestible way.  Many of the learning techniques taught are woven into the course, which is ideal!  I plan to share this class and the learning techniques I've gleaned with everyone because I think everyone could benefit, regardless of background.  This was truly a delight.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you for teaching me how to be a better learner!!!
Really enjoyable course full of helpful insights, methods, and tips to improve learning and studying. It’s all distilled from the latest neurological research as is demonstrated by the extensive further reading and reference lists. I wish I’d had the benefit of this course when I was a younger student at university. I especially liked the material about how to overcome procrastination and illusions of competence. I’ve now adopted lots of the methods and practises into my daily and weekly routines.
Thank you for teaching this critical course. It helps me better understand scientifically from neuro perspective how our brain functions and reacts. I was able to apply the ideas in this course such as habit development and procrastination to my own life and better adjust and notice my own behaviors. By sharing this course  and the concept in the course with my friend allow me to better understand the ideas taught. Thanks again for sharing such a crucial mooc course that everyone can benefit from.
I benefit from this course as it helped me with other online and offline courses. After I know how my brain works, I learn more efficiently than before without sacrificing the time for rest and sleep. I recommended this course to many of my friends and I recommend it here to people who don't want to give up learning - if you are considering about other courses on coursera and don't know if you can complete them, try this course first. It can be a good one to start and it will help you with others.
I have to say "Wow" for the experience i got by joining this course. First i didn't expect a lot when I enrolled then I was amazed by the so many useful tips I got from it. No wonder this course being recommended by students. Both Professor Barbara Oakley and Professor Terrence Sejnowski deliver very useful information for anyone who want to upgrade their learning skill. The way they present this MOOC is also incredible. It is simple, not boring, funny, and of course easy to understand. Good job.
As mentioned, this course is all about learning what we already learnt. Probably, our parents or seniors or elder had already told us to do. Somethings adopted and somethings not. However this course teaches the principles behind what they taught to us. After knowing the principles and science behind the teaching, the teaching becomes all very authentic and somewhere integrates all the memory chunks.  While the study material was scientific however good care was taken to present it in simple way.
This is one of those rare courses which helped me in giving the tools to learn effectively. Honestly speaking I didn't know about Pomodoro, chunking, interleaving, deliberate practice and neuro-chemicals' role until I completed the course. Thank you Barbara and Terry for making me fall in love with learning again in my mid-life. Great Job. Your crisp presentation and pace of delivery should be emulated by anyone who intends to teach online. Love you and hope to have more courses from you shortly.
An excellent course that everyone can benefit from. We are all always learning new things in life. The technics covered in 'Learning How to Learn' course on Coursera by Drs. Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski can help anyone improve the way they grasp new information and commit it to memory. I personally enjoyed taking this course and it has had an immense impact on my own learning already and I can't even begin to imagine how much it will accelerate my learning in the future in any other space.
I found this course extremely informative.  I really enjoyed Barbara's slides as they were particularly easy to understand and follow.  I found that the other Professor relied too heavily on the notes he was reading, avoided eye-contact in parts, and didn't have the flow of Barbara.  Obviously an extremely clever gentleman however I thought it was worth mentioning.  Really pleased to be able to take such a quality course for free so a big thanks goes to Coursera but more so, McMaster University.
Great teachers, great course, thank you! I've learnt a lot and really enjoyed watching all the videos and learning about how our brain works and getting very useful tools to help me learn more efficiently. I highly recommend this very interactive course to anyone willing to learn how to manage their time better, be more productive in the way they study, be more confident in their capacity to learn anything new.A very big thank you to all the people who contributed to the creation of this course.
This course was very helpful to me,  it showed me a lot of new approaches, and also showed me to take my Engineering experience and apply it to studying they way I would approach an engineering project. It also helped me to calm down about that I'm not the only one with some of the problems mentioned in the course. What I also found interesting where the examples of the people true history and who overcame their problems this was very inspiring. thank you very much ! Hans Van der Veken (Belgium)
The course was well paced and structured, allowing anyone, even someone quite busy with other distractions, to manage.  There is a wealth of material to focus on, but as the course points out, it is the time you "meditate, sleep and exercise" around what you are learning that allows your defused thinking to store the gems of information away to be used for a lifetime.  Great resources too, and both Terry and Barbara were quietly advocates for never being careless about learning.  Thank you both.
Good course. I definitely feel as if I've improved my learning skills. I wish I'd had a course like this when I was at school - I'm sure I would have done much better (I wasn't too bad, but I wasn't the best either). I think it's also useful for older people like me (40+) because I can still apply this to lots of areas of life and, as the course explains, we can carry on learning throughout life so there's every reason to do this. I might use the information I've learned here to change careers.
I wish I knew this way back when I was studying at the university. Fantastic course, explaining very important things about how human brain works in a series of small, comprehensive videos. I would recommend it to anyone who considers learning something new. I have also really appreciated the supportive mood of this course and general approach that learning is for everyone and even if you are terrible at, e.g. math, it is a matter of time and your own effort to succeed in learning this subject.
This course has shown me behind the curtains of how our brain works, especially when it comes to learning new things.It has imparted with research proven techniques on how I can learn more effectively and has made learning new things a fun challenge to me.I especially loved to pomodoro technique on how to beat procrastination.Dr. Barbara Oakley really outdid herself with her fun anecdotes and the way she explained things with such simplicity.This MOOC could not have been constructed more aptly.
I´m so please to follow this course. I´ve 57 years old, I realise iit is getting a little more dificult to learn , I've started to learn french since 2014, I have 3 years with a high motivation and perseveration, but I want to continue studing FOREVER, I need to LEARN how to learn , and that why this course is an invaluable treasury for me . THANKS so much for the contents  quality, the way to present them y the high proffesional level of every person on it.Adalis Facenda from Barcelona - Spain
Very good overview on learning "how to learn". Having already read "A mind for numbers" (AMFN) from the same author (Oakley), I can say that -to me at least- this was a good recap of the material already "chucked" from the book. Most of the extras in each course's week (different from the book) are interesting and well-thought. I recommend to read AMFN to those who have liked this course, because it goes more in-depth on some topics, but this course is definitely worth it even without the book.
The most useful course I've ever taken! It explained  how brain works when you try to learn something in a very practical and easy way. The course gives useful tools and techniques how to overcome procrastination and overlearning. It destroys the belief that some people are good for science only and some are only for humanitarian areas. You really can do everything with the right approach and deliberate practice. Thank you Barbara and the course team for sharing your personal inspiring stories.
The techniques learned in this course can really be used, not only for learning something new but in many other areas of my life.  I acquired practical advice that was easy to remember and not so "far out" that I found it hard to believe they'd work.  And I enjoy Barbara's style of teaching-I found it calming and easily understood.  I would recognize this course to students of all ages.  You are never too old to learn new things.  I learned some things I've never tried and I am 53 years young.
A very useful course covering concepts behind how to learn effectively and efficently. Barbara Oakley is a warm and friendly presenter whose videos make a potentially dull subject fun and enjoyable (with the use of zombies, flying mules, etc). Terrence Sejnowski tends to do one main video a week, detailing more anatomical/medical aspects. I'd recommend it to anyone who is about to undertake some serious studying as it covers techniques such as overcoming procrastination and learning fallacies.
A big thank you to the course instructors Terrence and Barbara, a very informative MOOC on how the brain works and how we can apply ourselves in mastering any subject we are interested in. This course has practical tools and techniques to get you started in the journey of learning. I high recommend to anyone who is struggling to grasp new concepts, getting back to school after a while, career change or already in school. And lastly if you are a teacher, you definitely have to take this course!
If you are trying to learn a new skill or study something new, regardless if you are student, professional or just someone that likes to learn, you MUST TAKE THIS COURSE FIRST before anything else, as it will give you the tools and techniques required, to help make learning more effective and fun. I think Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have created a little gem in the teaching field, that anyone interested in learning or involved in the teaching field must study and appreciate.
It is faith-giving to see reliable and proven scientific facts about knowing and improving our brains performance. There is almost no redundancy in the materials presented in this course. I was a person who struggled years and years to study and work efficiently during the day. This course is a game/life-changer for me. Im not exaggerating at all. I am now doing almost 3 times more than i did a day, in terms of hours of focused work/study. I cant be grateful enough to creators of this course.
This course reinvigorated a belief that I can learn and retain information useful to my life. I have been out of school for about 7 years and was anxious to go back or do studying of any kind. I happened upon this course through an article of self improvement and it was a fantastic find. It helped me understand some of my self defeating beliefs related to learning and how to move forward with useful study and retention techniques. Thank you Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski for this wonderful class!
I've done a lot of learning skills courses before, but none were as directly relatable as this one was. The presenters are engaging, informative, and fun. I've already begun using some of the techniques and reference materials shown in the course.  (Anki is so simple and so effective!)U sing tools and techniques from this course, I've  upped my learning skills, and I've finally gotten around to doing something concrete about my procrastination! I've already recommended this course to others.
It's amazing learning about the things helpful to keep learn. I have a lot of difficult to understand and keep focus in a task, but this course help me to understand how my mind work and how I can improve my skills, develop new skills and have new goals. It was my second MOOC, I had difficul to keep the course because my time is short, I work and study at  the same time, but I know it's very important this course to help me understand myself and improve my professional life and private life.
Suitable for students of ALL ages. If you are interested in becoming a better learner overall, regardless of your course of study I HIGHLY recommend this course. The techniques discussed in this course will help to relieve much of the anxiety that we all share when it comes to learning something new. Learning is a lifelong endeavor, why not strengthen your learning habits now! It is never too late to become a better learner, and "Learning how to Learn" will help do just that. Happy Learning!
This course is exceptional! Thank you for presenting such complex material in such an accessible way. I also appreciate the pop up mini-tests and the way the questions have been written, as this helps with acquisition. Also demonstrating the power in what you are teaching as you are modelling the techniques. This is a great start to building confidence for students and those who would like to return to studying at a higher level.  Much appreciation to you all for providing this opportunity.
This course has changed my perspective of learning and made sure that I learn with an open mind. The techniques mentioned in this course are scientifically backed and have helped me with my focus. One take away that I highly recommend everyone should try is the Pomodoro Technique i.e. Learn with complete focus for 25 minutes, then reward yourself with a break of 5-10 minutes allowing your brain to do it's job of (unintentionally) recalling things you've learnt in the topic you are learning.
A must for every student, working man or woman out there. The course depicts the biological concepts behind learning and the necessary psychological elements that everyone must know to become better at it. It's a course that should be taught in every university as the first class when you enter it. Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski will take you on a beautiful journey that will make you understand better your brain, mind and make you fall in love with learning. Thank you for this awesome course!
I think that this course is really fundamental and it is necessary to learn best practices how to learn new material and how to broad our passion and other interest. I think this it is amazing course, but English is not my native language and for me it is a good idea to start this course again and to repeat it. Also I was not very active and didn't collaborate with other students, so I think it is necessary also to fix this part :)I also very appreciated the Tutors and enjoy their speeches.
I haven't finished the course yet, but I liked it so much that I convinced my husband and my mom to enroll in it as well. The content of this course is so important that I honestly think it should be a mandatory class for everyone who is genuinely interested in learning, which could be a teenager on High School or an adult starting college. Finding this course feels like finding a treasure, thanks for creating such an amazing course and making it available on Coursera to the general public!
Simply put, this course should be taught in schools. The insights I have gained into how we learn have been astounding. The videos are enaging and fun, all thanks to Barb and Terry's endearing nature. I liked that the science behind why these methods work are explained rather than brushed over or dumbed down like I have seen in other courses.I am yet to find the degree or subject I would like to master but I do know the techniques taught in this course will play a big part in achieving it.
This is not a casual course to accomplish rather a boon for those who have a false image for themselves that they cannot be improved. In all my honesty , this course in really a must do for everyone who want to make themselves better and also for those who want to make themselves the best.At last , I would truly thanks the whole Coursera community for introducing such courses for us and a big thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for being such nice and great instructors.
Perfect. Now I know how the brain works. I understand that procrastination is addiction and you just need to put effort into starting doing something. Just go through bad feel in brain like through the brick wall. Time after time it will be easier to start, because brain will remember rewards that await. Also, it's very important to focus on process, not on the final product. Thank you very much for course authors. Also big thanks for creating such a wonderful MOOC system, coursera admins!
I can't express how much I enjoyed and resonated with this course. I wish I'd had it several years ago when I returned to school to finish my bachelor's degree. It would have made a huge difference. As it is, I'm confident in newfound abilities to study and absorb new skills and subjects as I move forward as a lifelong learner. Bravo, and thanks to the makers for allowing so many of us to audit the full course. I'll be recommending it to everyone I know who begins an educational endeavor.
If there is only one MOOC you can take, this would be it. It is not a theory class, instructors talk about practical methods and explain the science behind them too. In fact, it is one of the most practical courses I have seen. You can use the techniques in your professional and financial life too. If you are interested  in becoming better at learning things, just go take the course. NOTE: Honors section of the course is optional but if you do it, you will learn some really useful things.
This course helps us to know more about our brain , how our brain gasp the concept that we study and how can we make our brain remember the things more easily.It speaks about various techniques like memory palace and others which will help you to increase your memory . Also by understanding the techniques taught by them and the various facts given by them about our memory and working of brain  we can improve the skill of  how to learn and make our concepts last for long without cramming.
Loved this course. Its all about the process of learning, rather than the product of learning. The course builds a basic understanding of key principals of neuroscience in order to explain how humans learn, and therefore teaches the pupil how they can more effectively.Some of the lessons I had heard before, but now I understanding WHY they are so important to apply in learning. Knowing this, I have already changed approaches at work, as well as in my personal learning.Highly recommended.
Learning How to Learn not only help me with organization with the tools trick and tips, also help me understand how people's mind work, it gives enough information to know your intellectual abilities I definitely recommend this course to anyone because it was extremely helpful to me. my friend my family and everyone I let them know how much this class help me. I also will recommend the book A Mind for Numbers. Thank you so much to all  stuff members  hat provide this free helpful course.
Today more than ever, we are facing a huge problem around the world, called COVID-19, thereby, we need a powerful tool for adapting to the increasing rate of change. This course give you methods of learning how to learn, it doesn't matter the field of study. Provide you a useful technique to overcome procrastination like "Pomodoro technique", and also some extra reading material and interviews from interesting people who share they're own tips of learning in order to achieve their goals.
Great course. I took it in preparation for returning to Uni to get a Computer Science degree. I have Intuitively known I am a much naturally stronger 'creative' person than say a math person, but It was great to dive Into the deeper science behind It and how I can leverage my existing strengths as well as broaden and deepen my current weaknesses In learning particular subjects. Instructor Is pretty great and I recommend for anyone looking to enhance their learning In all aspects of life.
This is my first course I took and completed on Coursera. I love how you structure the lectures, enthusiasm in each videos, the learner could interact with videos, take free quizzes. This course opens mind eyes, refresh my mind, and give me a lot of great and useful technique in approaching, learning and understand new difficult concepts. I would love to recommend this course for my friends. Thanks Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team for this great course.
This course provides each learner the tool kit to learn subjects that are at times daunting. Rather than offering platitudes the suggestions are based on sound research.They  tap the capacities of the brain after understanding how our brains function.Having that  insight has helped me from getting frustrated when the material is hard to master.The sections on chunking, memory and procrastination has been of invaluable help.A deep bow to the creators of the course and to course era.Thanks
I  had been wanting to take an online course for a long time. Finally I did it and could not have been more glad that this course was the first one. For me is hard to see value in these free courses but I am very pleased with what I have learned on it. The knowledge acquired on this course can be applied right away on any desired task. It gives you a broad understanding on how our brain works in terms of learning new things. I would highly recommend this course. Health and Peace To All.
I have learned so much from this course. Many details that I was not giving much attention to, now I am taking them into consideration. I have learned about memory and it's ways of working. I found out how to properly learn, how not to waste time. I will use as much as I can from this course in my daily life and I really think everyone can benefit from it. It changes your perspective about the process of learning. And, last but not least, it is very interesting and fun at the same time.
A very usefull and easy-going class to improve your overall learning skills. I must admit that being a person that speaks English not as a mother tongue at first had some problems with understanding, but with the help of subtitles it was quiet easy. I am sure that in future using tips, notions and exercises that i dealt with in this class i can really improve my approach in new subjects no matter what they will be. It suits everyone.   Great thanks for people who do such incredible job.
Before doing this course I knew some of the techniques that are mentioned in this course videos but I didn't know the name of the techniques also didn't utilize those techniques on me properly. After finishing I am feeling relaxed and now I can think more clearly about all the techniques I have learned and feel confident. At last, I want to thank Madam Dr. Barbara Oakley, she is a great teacher as well as a humble person who did a lot of hard works to make the course easy to understand.
Amazing course! Some statements I knew from time-management (such as making a task list or Pomodoro technique), but now I understand them 'cause in this course these statements were explained through science. And it's very interesting to learn how our brain works.Also I was very inspired by all people from interviews, it's a very good option in this course.Great thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this couse and for making me believe in my strength and potential!
An amazing course. I wasn't expecting much when I enrolled a few weeks ago but the more I studied and watched the lessons I was surprised with so many great tips and resources to understand and become a better learner. I found it funny that there were some techniques that I already use but have never thought on them. I reccomend this course to anyone, either in high school or college, or even as preparation for other courses in Coursera. Why don't they teach this in elementary schools?
This course has been awesome. Since starting this course, i see the practical application in all most every life situation. For example, when i feel overwhelmed by a task, i have learned to take time out from the task at hand and do something totally unrelated then go back the task later, and yes, it does seem to magically appear more doable. i will also break the task up into smaller tasks and that works well. This course is great for everyday life!!!!  Thank you, Thank you Thank you
It's a really interesting and never thought about kind of learning that I received from this course. In fact i started using the learnings to even continue and complete this course, which I thought would be left in mid way. This is really effective and i would definitely recommend this over spending 20 hours on any netflix best rated series..  its not because Netflix isn't good, but this course is better and its needed for you to stay in the game.. the game of Life.. Happy learning...
After taking this class, I realized I wasted my whole life in learning new skills and left out many skills behind believing that I can not learn or I do not have that particular gene or something to learn those new skills. Now, after taking this course, I am feeling like- make a list that I ever wanted to learn and start it - And I am pretty much confident now that I will excel. I am more confident than ever.Thanks to Coursera and Barbara for removing those bad zombies out of my mind.
very helpful to me. It seems I learned for a long time with bad learing habits which did make me hard to reach the targets. I didn't realise that the bad habits and concepts really make my learning ineffective everyday until I took this course. And the skills introduced and experence sharing in the insteresting interviews not only help me how to learn effectively but also let me wanna pick up more subjects which I once gave up. Yes, wanna try the learning skills in the new challenges.
Great course, helps a lot to develop learning practice. even though I do not have put them all into practice anymore can see my mind accepting with good idea. Many thanks to Barbara Oakley and all of you who help me with this course, from the Good Doctors to the production and editing of videos in Portuguese that helped me a lot to complete the course. And the vision of being a free course with this helping many people around the World, Again Thank you very much and God bless you all
It gave me a lot of new information about learning and not only. Information about procrastination and pomidorro technique was surprisingly interesting for me. Becase as a big procrastinator I thought that İ was born this way and cannot change anything.It is interesting to test the technique "start hard jump easy", because I always tried to finish easy task first in order to feel myself self confident and to finish as much item as possible quickly leaving  lot of time for hard tasks.
This Learning how to Learning is strongly recommended for any type of people who still breathing and looking for improve anything in their life, general speaking , every one of us. It will help you understand how your brain work, how to learn the effective way, how to do tests/exam and get with maximum result. All of the materials are backed and support by research of neuroscience. Both instructor are best of these neuroscience field. And lasting you will have some laugh. Have fun^^
I think this is one of the best courses anybody could take. It is truly helpful to learn effectively and efficiently, and ever since I have taken this course (and read the book before taking the course), my learning capability has been skyrocketed.

I think every student should take this course. This would help tremendously in the studies/learning progress, as no matter how hard you work, if you work the wrong way then it is a waste of time and effort(and you get minimal result).
E
Barbara Oakley is an excellent presenter with right speed and right amount of content per slide. The metaphors and analogies used by her in the videos have not only made the entire course light weight yet deep rooted in my memory but also taught me the best way to make slides to keep the viewer glued.It is such a pleasure to complete the course waiting eagerly for the next videos and now finishing the next course "Mindset". Wish her goodluck and hope to enrol in her future courses.
Learning without knowing how to learn is much more like getting into water without knowing how to swim !!That what you're going to learn in here and that what they don't teach you in schools This course is a must for not only the students  but also for any learner who is concern about getting better in life and learn more effectively and passionatelyI wish I knew half of the principles and learning facts discussed in this course earlier in my studying journeybut it's never too late
Simply a great course with tools that help you understand not only how to improve learning, but also how can you improve your life through making yourself conscient about the skills, fears, competences, and external factors involved in your every single activity you're facing. With charming professors and inspiring testimonies this course has the potential of being life changing opportunity to know better about yourself and to start pursuing things you've been always wanting to do.
Actually the course is really great , the way that you are introducing the information is perfect , it helped me a lot, it changes in my mind and i am sure it will change more on the long runBig respect to the instructors Dr. Barbara and Dr. Sejnowski , so proud that i meet you( on the course) :) every session , i really would like to meet you face to face to thank you a lot for your effort May Allah reward you for that :)Wish you both successThanks Coursera for such a great course
My first Coursera effort.  Seriously, seriously impressed!  Dr Oakley doesn't just have practical techniques, her delivery is imbued with a warmth and humanity that will encourage students round the world to listen up and take notice.  I found myself thinking that she and Prof Sejnowski are outstanding ambassadors for their sciences as well as the academic culture they hail from.  Makes you want to be a part of it!!Thanks guys - I will rate and review far and wide as much as I can.
Through this course, I learned about working and long-term memory mechanisms. I find out that my style of studying in 20 years of education (from grade 1 to half of my PhD.) was inappropriate. Now, I know about the power of recall, deliberate excercises and of course a full night sleep before an important test. I think if I knew these facts when I was at highschool my life would be different. I wish healthy joyful life for prof. Oakly and Senjowsky, as they change rest of my life.
I want to thank everyone who took part in formulating such an informative, thought-provoking, and challenging course. I have learned a lot and I will continue to review and practice the concepts and skills that were covered. These lessons may be applied across the humanities and are helpful across the masses. I have learned more about myself and plan to share information with others, as I analyze and build up/breakdown more of myself. Thank you.Barbara Oakley! Terrence Sejnowski!
This is an excellent course on learning with life changing ideas and techniques.Barbara did an excellent job of explaining concepts in a simple and easy to understand manner. Every lecture is only 3 - 6 minutes long so it doesn't require a huge time commitment.I had a lot of fun learning how to learn and I can't wait to incorporate what I learned to my every day life. Thank you Barbara!This course should be a compulsory curriculum for students all over the world. It is that good!
A highly recommended course for everyone struggling with memory, concentration and learning issues while learning something new. The modules were extremely well sorted and easily explained to help grasp the key concepts of learning.  Learned a lot form this course. I sincerely hope to put to use all the facts and techniques I acquired from this course in my daily life and improve my lifestyle. Thanks a lot for the course!   
Eagerly looking forward to learning more from coursera.
This course is literally a stargate for everyone has had problems to 
accomplish a long and structured course of study due to what Barbara 
calls properly " zombie " thus,  thanks to all the helpfull tools 
learned here I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to grow my knowledge upon
 matters i love and really desire to study in my future for my career .

At least, from the deep of my heart, thank you for your efforts and willingness to positively influence our lifes .

This is a very interesting course for those who want to get an insight of how some people succeed in bringing the best out of them while many others struggle. The methods and tips discussed in the course are very helpful and easy to apply it in real world problems.The course is made concise and doesn't take up too much of time. 2 hours in a week should be enough to complete the course in 4 weeks. The explanation of topics are also done very well that makes it easy to understand.
This course does something that I think every education system should use as a hard foundation to their teaching philosophy, it teaches people how to learn effectively and efficiently.  It is incredibly frustrating that in my 18+ years as a student through primary education and on to graduate levels, I was never meaningfully taught how to study for myself but this course has done an outstanding job of doing just that.  This should be required learning for every education system.
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to rethink parts of my work as teacher. During the sessions of this course I already gave my students some hints, such as "pomodoro" (it was the first time I heard about it, although I'm Italian :)). The next step will be encouraging those who struggle with study and giving them some tools. Another thing I love is returning to be a student and taking tests: this helps me understanding what's going on in the students mind.Grazie mille e ciao!!
Though I did not take the paid certificate option because I do not have the funds right now, I appreciate the fact that I can learn such wonderful techniques and tools from people who have been able to break through barriers in their own fields. Thanks to Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski, I feel like I have a lot of zombie super-powers now. If you want to know why you have not been doing so well with some courses, this is the class for you. Would probably be the best month of your life
Great and well-explained information on the subject. Plenty of relevant info on the brain and body in relation to both learning and well-being, as well as practical study tools and practices. The course also had a great structure; well-built for retention of the material, and applying the principles explained in the course. Really happy with the experience and information provided, and I will make sure to apply the information and learning tools during my pursuit of knowledge :)
This is my first course on this site and I really enjoyed it.  The interesting thing is, some of the things the professors spoke about are things I've done before but it wasn't that effective because I did it wrong.  This course simply teaches how to learn effectively but it's up to you to practice what you've been thought. The professors are wonderful and so are the interviews.  Either you are having difficulty studying or you want to improve your studies, this course is great!
This course helped me to realize and pinpoint a lot of the really bad habits that I've always had while learning anything. It has also taught quite a few really nice and effective methods to be able to leave those bad habits as well to learn in the most efficient way, just as the name suggests. I'm thankful to the instructors for this amazing course, and would suggest everyone like me, who has always had problems with performing well even after spending a lot of time preparing.
The course was a joy to take! So many interesting topics, interviews and explanations. Loads of interesting and useful material to learn to approach, examine and study any subject. It clearly opens a path for a better and easier way of learning whatever we want.  Both instructors were kind and generous with their knowledge and way of conducting their classes. Special thanks to Mrs. Barbara Oakley for her kindness and warm way of explaining and teaching all. Such a sweet lady !!
Fantastic course! Wish I had taken this class and/or read Dr. Oakley's book when I was an undergraduate in college and/or in graduate/B-school. So many wonderful trips and tricks for getting the most out of your education and learning experience. I enrolled in the course to learn new and effective methods for absorbing and applying information more quickly in my professional working life, while also balancing the demands of running a start-up in the evenings.  Five-star course!
After going through this course, first week only, I realized that this subject itself, should be the first course that any university students or adults or students should go through FIRST, before studying the really tough ones inside Coursera.org.Basically, it's a course to share tips on how to learn faster, and remember better, and possibly mastery in the subject that you are after!This course is structured in a very fun manner, even the quizes are very humourous to answer!
It's been a great pleasure to join this course. I have learned helpful tools, and best of all I am inspired.Inspired to use the tools.Inspired to share my knowledge of learning.Inspired by the knowledge of this course flowing to other areas of my interest.Do read the extra material. Do watch the extra videos. I urge you.And last, do the honors submissions. You learn from doing them. You learn from reviewing your piers. And you learn from the generous feedback from your piers.
This is a very inspire and deeply interesting course!  All of parts architected are simple, competently and logical. After course i find many of my bad mistakes and i hope it helps me to be better and learn faster.  Because we learn through all the life! I  finished my university many years ago, but now i would learn by Barbara Oakly and Dr. Senjowsky with pleasure. You are the great teachers! Thanks for learned me how to learn! with respect, Rouslan Boulatov, Moscow, Russia.
This course has given me insights on how to improve my learning techniques to help me better understand what I'm trying to learn. I really enjoyed how the instructors explained the materials. Everything was easy to understand and I have been implementing some of the methods or techniques I find effective for me, such as the Pomodoro technique and the spaced repetition. Thank you very much for this wonderful course! I can't stress enough how I recommend this course to anyone.
Outstanding! This is the first Mooc you should take. It will set a new, and firm foundation for learning, retaining, and re-examining how you learn. It reveals how the mind works, and how many of the old ways we were taught to learn aren’t nearly as effective as we thought. Dr Barb Oakley and Dr Terry Sejnowski are so extremely relatable and informative. Love them! After this class, you might really enjoy “ Mindshift “, by them. Waiting for more...hint,hint...Barb and Terry.
Firstly, I would like to thank Dr.Terrence sejnowski and  Dr.Barbara Oakley for sharing something which is the foundation of learning which provides a content worth learning by every single being.The best part what I found was that  along with the verbal explanation it is very well illustrated which goes very well with our understanding the concept in a better way.I highly appreciate the background work and would recommend others to get benefited from this course.Thank you.
I've learned many things in the course. The insight on the two different modes of thinking is important in learning as I would know that being relaxed and just taking the time away (diffused mode) away from the material can help solidify the concept in the brain. Study habits and even motivation that even the less brilliant can achieve great things is definitely enlightening. 

This course have bring wonders to me, and would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.
This course was really well presented with lots of references and examples. I was already familiar with most of the principals and techniques discussed and yet I feel like a really learned a lot. The important thing really is to actually apply these concepts in all your studies, make them habitual, and that can only come from practice, persistence, consistency and determination. This course was well worth my time and I also found the in-course interviews quite fascinating.
Learning How to Learn is a wonderful subject and is taught greatly by professor's of McMaster University. I would like to thank them for creating such a wonderful course. I did all the mentioned activities and assignments and understood the importance of the way you learn. I have learned a lot of useful techniques from the course which will surely help me learn more effectively. Infact, I have started implementing a few of them already - starting with Pomodoro Technique :)
Thank you so much to Prof. Barb Oakley, Prof. Terry Sejnowski and the Learning How to Learn Team. The quirky humor combined with the useful techniques taught in the course have helped me better understand my learning tendencies. Not only that, my oh-so-persistent habit of procrastination has now been reduced to the brainsize of the zombies of this course. Big thanks to the Pomodoro technique, I kept my procrastination zombie controlled and mostly asleep.
Thanks again guys!
The first course in Coursera that I have completed is this. I have used many MOOCs like edX,NPTEL,Futurelearn. But no one provide such high quality online courses like Coursera. "Learn How To Learn" course is the best one to show how MOOCs(Coursera specially) do great job.After enrolling this course, I have also purchased the book "A mind for numbers". This is really wonderful. The book really changed my learning way and the course ignite me to utilize the MOOCs life long.
This course is my very first one on Coursera. It provides all the helpful learning tips, scientifically proven, in a fun and easy-to-understand way. I love how the course is designed with short videos and quizzes. The quiz questions are very helpful in recalling the info. I also love how the assignments are designed. All the modules--videos, quizzes, homework, optional reading--were designed with one purpose, i.e., to help the audience learning better. Thank you very much!
first, I would like to thank Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr.Terrence Sejnowski for their effort to make the information very simple to the beginners like me. it the first time for me to attend an online course but it was not difficult and I enjoy that very much. I would like to recommend this powerful learning machine for all students to begin their education life with the basic steps of this course. I learn a lot from this course and I will implement it with my daily routine.
The course information was easy to understand, but highly beneficial for anyone who would like best practices in learning how to learn. Whether this information is for someone who is interested in life-long learning opportunities or for students there were many ideas shared that would help people actually learn information vs. just remembering it for short periods of time. As a wise person I know often says, "The ideas are simple; they are not easy, but they are simple!"
One of the finest learning experiences I have EVER had.  Not only was the content outstanding but the elearning format was used with a skill beyond anything I had seen before.  I will review every course turned out by this provider in the hope of having another first rate learning experience.  Oh, oh, one more thing the listing of sources was a wonderful addition.  There are several topics where i would like to research further.WHAT A WONDERFUL EDUCATIONAL OFFERING!!!!!!
Some topics like rereading helped me realize that it is not effective and makes me forget the topic and lead to illusions of competence. Pomodoro technique is really effective that helps me focus to process. Chunking got my  interest and wanted to apply this while learning.  I tought neurons never born everyday. They can survive by doing physical exercise. I learned much. Really.Thank you very much for this course to the nth power. Really helpful. 10 / 5 for this course.
This is an excellent course to take for any student. Simplified concepts that are easy to comprehend are neatly organized to hold your focus to teach you the ropes on teaching yourself.  I have reconfigured my own way of approaching materials I would like to learn and have gain great confidence in my own learning capability. This course is not only recommendable for anyone who is enthusiastic about learning, but also to people who would like to improve their way of life.
This was an excellent course that provides a lot of insight into how your brain retains information and thinks, but does so using easy-to-understand images and metaphors, so you'll soak everything up like a sponge in no time. It also offers some excellent tips against procrastination, which is useful for just about anybody. Even if you're not actually learning about anything, I recommend everyone to check out this course to learn some great habits to improve one's life.
Every week after going through different techniques I wondered I was using half of it unknowingly but had not identified it as the cause behind my good performance in my studies. This course has helped me understand the reasons behind the use of these techniques and how it effects our neural structure. So, it would help me in future to learn tough concepts easily and apply those concepts in the real world. Thank you Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for this course.
I am 71 and completed the weeks two and three tests a couple of weeks after learning the material. I was away on vacation and didn't actively think about the course at all. This was a demonstration for me of how clearly the instructors "walk the talk". They methods of teaching this course model the concepts being presented. As a lifelong learner, I am extremely excited by what I have learned and will continue to integrate the practices going forward.Thank you so much!!
The course is very inspiring and instructive. If we had a chance to learn this course years ago, that would greatly benefit us not only for our studies but for the whole life I think. The way we think leads to what and how we do. But anyway, it's better late than never. I would consciously try to put all what I've learned in this course into use in my real life, I'd love to see what changes is stored for me there. Thanks very much for the wonderful courses you present.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course mainly because it has taught me valuable lessons and learning techniques I can use and revisit in my future studies. I may even revisit this course just to solidify the techniques I have picked up through this course. Growing up, I didn't have many great mentors to teach me how to approach learning through school and various academic areas. I hope to be able to deepen the learned techniques by preaching them and teaching them to others.
Incredible!! I learned so much and all of the curriculum was so easy to absorb and apply. I am now taking 10 other Coursera courses at the University of London, Yale, Stanford, Penn State, Wharton, UC San Diego, Santa Clara University, Columbia University, Macquarie University and Northwesten University, and I am sure to apply all that I leaned from this course to getting what I need from these courses as well. Thank you all so much for helping me learn how to learn!!
Great course, lecturers were understandable, supportive and cheerful which helps in continuing. I do recommend this course to all who have very basic idea of how our mind works and want to better understand how to become a better learner. From my perspective I had a feeling that the course is more high school oriented and that's why many things were repeated too many times in very simplistic ways (as opposed to letting people to rewatch a video if they are uncertain).
The teachers were knowledgable, clear and gave a very powerful demonstration of learning techniques, with a positive and constructive outlook. The video graphics and illustrations were very helpful in reminding the main concepts and connecting them to new ideas. The interviews were very interesting and the questions asked in them were helpful in recalling the concepts taught in that unit. Finally, the reading lists were comprehensive and again, very useful. Thank You!
This course is very easy to follow; the analogies & words used are easy to understand. The pace is also neither too fast nor too slow. As for the instructors, you can feel that they are sincere & really want their students to know how to learn. Afterall, no one really teaches you how to learn when you are young, even in schools. So, take this opportunity to learn the different & correct ways of learning by following this course & utilising the techniques taught in it.
At times it's not about the course but about reassurance and the confidence it gives you to be able to learn effectively again. A lot of these techniques probably I followed when I look back at my college day experiences but I never knew that if it was the correct pattern. It was mostly like a gut feeling for me like 'this works and this doesn't' kind of scenario. But after attending this course it feels like I have learned a major life hack to overcome my learning c
This is an excellent course.  I learned many new concepts such as chunking, diffused thinking, Einstellung, and so many new concepts.  I found the Pomodoro technique very useful.  Actually all the course contents are very useful.  Instructors are both are excellent.  Special thanks to Ms Barbara Oakley who conducted most of the sessions and is exceptional.  Thank you very much.  Recommend this course to all who are interested in learning and expanding their horizons.
This is very useful course since it’s all about learning for
any reasons or goals. I wish I was taking this course or getting to know this
subject when I was student in high school. I am sure my learning would be
different in better way.I recommend to mass and public to take advantage of this
concept of “Learning how to learn” gathered by Dr. Barbara Oakley.Many thanks to Coursera and Dr. Barbara Oakley for this
opportunity and effort to life up the public knowledge.
it has been a wonderful experience with many firsts, first online courses, peer-reviewed courses.it was truly helpful for the purpose I took to attending this course. Lectures and reading materials even the reviews/tests are based on the philosophy of Learning.It was a much-required journey to consolidate many thoughts.I would like to extend my heart-felt gratitude towards Dr Barbara Oakely and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for sharing their knowledge in such simple chunk/s.
I'd like to thank Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski for their excellent presentation of this course in video form. Never before in 25 years of taking classes have I encountered such excellence. You were engaging, persuasive and inviting. I did not want to walk away from your presence. The invited guests who did interviews brought an added touch to what the course was all about. I hope I can, some day, be the kind of presenter that you are.Elizabeth Enriquez Damian
This course has been a great experience. It gave me the knowledge of the best techniques and tips to Learn, to Study, to Memorize, to take tests, to join and choose a good study group. Also the Neuroscience behind learning, studying, memorizing. The amount of material learned and the amount of enjoyment this has given me is indescribable. I would recommend this course to everyone at any level. In fact, it should be available to everyone in the world. It is excellent!
This course is excellent! I'd say this is a must-take course. It covers many learning techniques supported by science, and it details how to beat procrastination. If (or when) you take this course, make sure to check out the optional readings and interviews at the end of each week as they provide valuable additional information that expand upon and can help solidify the material covered that week. I will definitely be employing the techniques discussed in the course!
Amazing course, I am still going back and reapplying the. material. It is good to take this course and listen to the reading along with it. Additionally, I recommend following the book and the course up with the Mindshift course and other readings such as Make It Stick. Lastly, apply what she says. I applied the pomodoro technique, the diffuse thinking, and focus on the process and not the product to be more effective. And, I definitely want to read more into Dr. S.
This is a must for any student hoping to improve their performance in any subject.  The professors provide actual tools to help you approach the process of learning. You are guaranteed to progress and ultimately flourish regardless of the field or whether or not you have a "natural" proclivity for the subject.  I owe a debt of gratitude to Professors Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and to Cousera for offering me this opportunity to learn how to learn.
Incredible course. It took me three months to complete it. I took my time and practiced everything I learned in the course, on the course material. I have reduced my test anxiety significantly by completing this course and just wish it was available decades ago as a high school student! The material has given me the confidence to pursue many things that scared me prior. Process over product! Kudos to Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski for an outstanding learning experience.
I am learning at age 56, that many of my learning techniques were actually quite ineffective. Also, that I can do better going forward(forming new neurons in my hippocampus is a lifelong process!). That is very empowering. The course is very enjoyable, explaining profound concepts in an easy to understand manner with a dash of humor. I originally took the course to inspire by 18 year old who is off to college, but eventually i completed it because I learnt so much.
Absolutely excellent course to start my educational journey with! I intend on using the methods presented in this course, not only for myself, but for my son as well while he is doing distance learning. I love the way Prof Oakley presented the material, and am looking forward to the other class she presents later in the year. Every Coursera learner should take this class, and I have also recommended it to a few of my friends who are working on their higher degrees!
You guys are rock stars! I appreciate you guys make this lesson so readable. English is my second language. I think I could handle like 70% of all content. I like reading articles or books but when I reading more and more. It happens a lot that I forgot what I just read. When I learning from this lesson, finally understood my old habit, not like recall content. So when I figure out is very easy to use this skill in the future. Thanks a lot from a student in Taiwan.
This course is by far the best I've had the privilege of learning from on the subject of learning. I wish I had access to this material decades ago. Short, to the point, brilliantly edited, full of useful analogies and metaphors; this course can help remove roadblocks and unwanted obstacles from your inner learning ability. Please, do yourself the favor of enrolling in and completing this course. You won't regret it (at least I didn't and I hope you won't either.)
I absolutely loved this course and all of the great information. The course content is very well structured and the creators Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski do an excellent job at delivering the course material. They just make it so much fun to get back to learning how to learn. I will be using this a reference for years to come, after all, I need to come back and deepen my learning with practice. Thank you for making this course it is truly helpful.
By far the best course I ever did on how to learn. It's amazing after spending so much of our lives learning new things, we never invest time in how to learn efficiently and effectively. The course has been a real eye opener, and is applicable to everyone at any age. It also educates you in a very lucid manner with various metaphors and animations of how your brain works and how to train it to learn, and retain new information better. Highly recommend this course.
This course
is very important for every one need to learn more easy and effective as I am learned
for more than 40 years ago but this course add more values to me to learning
how to learn more easy; more effective; new techniques.I learned
how the brains works this help us to dealing with it.This course
add to me valuables life skills; So I thanks Dr. barabara Oakley and Dr.
Rerrence Sejnowski very mush for good work.Also I would
thank Coursera for great helpful.
This course changed my life. Thank you for resurrecting my dreams so that fewer of them have to be wasted away because of procrastination, self-hatred, insecurity, forgetfulness, stubbornness, and fear. As a soon-to-be college student, I could not have asked for a better pre-college summer. I am no longer nervous about school and I am ready to learn about anything. I'm also ready to take over the world!You guys are amazing! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!
Peter completed this course.
This is by far the best course I have ever taken. It solidifies and explains everything I've known about studying and provides a deeper (yet simple ) understanding of why we behave in certain ways and how we can improve our learning capability.

Barbara Oakley was especially great, she has a good and steady flow and method of explaining that makes it easy for one to understand.

This should be mandatory in every school and university!
Excellent! 
This course should be not only like and optional instead more like a mandatory course at the beginning of the college or even earlier, things could be a lot more easier to do and one can be and feel better.Right now I have finished my career in Computational engineering and I'm actually working in a big size company, I can tell you that with applying a few things that I missed and learned in this course I feel I did in a week, the work of whole month.
That was an awesome course to attend and I highly recommend it to those, who struggle with studies and need learning tips and trick. It
is always difficult to make a first step, but when it is done there is a chance
to see a light at the end of the tunnel. This course got me illuminated and broadened
horizons in the process of learning. I will study hard and make my dream come true
by passing the exam and getting other learning outcomes in different
disciplines.
It was one of the best courses I've ever attended in my life. The explanations were so clear, even if English isn't my mother language. The professors made a wonderful work and were so kind, so so clear and friendly that I feel their passion for the topics and they were amazing in teaching me all of the things covered here, with lots of practical examples, advises to become a better student and not only, but also to train my brain and my memory to became better.
Great course with a lot of great tips and instruments on how to learn more effectively. Concept of two learning modes of our brain, chunks, repetition, einstallung, testing yourself, true understanding of the content, metaphors and analogies, on working and long-term memory, memory palace, zombie mode and procrastination, pomodoro technique, hard-start and easy jump, perseverance, deliberate practice, repetition, recalling and importance of discipline are great.
An excellent course to debunk the belief that if like me your not an institutional learner. All that's needed is the understanding of "How to Learn" and the correct process. These are ideas that have brought together things i thought i did right and things that i clearly did wrong like cramming for an exam.This course has changed the way i look at learning and given me the belief and confidence to not only learn new topics but also enjoy the process of learning.
Feeling glad and happy. Did learn some new stuffs but did learn loads of new terms and theoretical insights within brain processing's. Thank you so much. Simply loved the session. It was great getting back to theoretical learning after a long break. Learning online was something i've always wanted for pretty long. Glad that finally got to it. Many thanx to everyone who made it possible including MDEC and my cousin who introduced it. Thank you. Have a great day.
One of the best trainings i have attended. Very well structured. Concise and excellent presentations. Lots of testing. Very interesting topics relating to the functioning of the brain that can affect our learning capacity. Number of useful tools to leverage on the brain´s nature and unleash our learning potential. Opportunity to learn by reviewing the work of other student. All this for 2 hours a week over 4 weeks. Plus a number of optional readings and videos.
I really loved this course. While I didn't go for the certification as I was searching for better ways to study, this course was quite wonderful. Barbara does a wonderful job at explaining things and I learned so much about my brain and study methods. This really helped me tackle things and improve my learning, especially as I was searching for such knowledge already for years. So if you're interested or challenged in learning, go for it, you won't lose time ;)
The course is very relevant to anyone who thinks learning is an ongoing process. It is very important to people who don't think so. The course brings to the forefront the basis of key issues in learning and also provides concrete techniques to help one learn better. It provides opportunity for the learner to reflect on his/her own problems and helps improve. Hearty thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrace Sejnowski for helping me take my learning to the next level!
A very helpful course. Barbara is a very delightful instructor. I did also enjoy learning a bit about the brain in relation to learning from Dr. Terrell. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to learn more effectively and efficiently. There's a good number of learning techniques in this course.  The Pomodoro technique is one technique that is so easy to do and yet so effective in stopping procrastination. That alone has made a huge difference. Thanks so much.
In this changing world, taking this course means changing your perspective towards learning. The instructors we're precise with what they have to render, they made the learning easy and informative. The course talks about various skills and methods for learning how to learn. They talk scientifically about the strategies which have been proved to be effective and productive for people. The best part is that it is practical. Thank you for offering such a course.
A wonderful way of learning the scientific foundations of many useful learning techniques. With powerful examples, images and stories, Barbara and Terrence teach us what mechanisms are activated when we learn, which modes does our brain use to tackle with problems, how to improve our memory and how to overcome procrastination, among other contents. This course is fun, informative, useful and very easy to follow. Thanks for having put this boon to our disposal!
For someone who wants to improve to become a better learner, this is the course you have to take. I learn many tips and tricks on how to learn better, what technique you can you use to tackle your deficiencies, and the motivating stories of others which encourage us that anyone can be a master at something, anyone. I hope I can re-watch the videos again, I would love to re-watch it again. Please. Thank you for the lesson. Looking forward to your other courses.
I find this course as very enriching one, with wonderful lectors! The information discussed down here brought me to many other different topics in conversation with friends, streghtened my knowledge base and motivated me to follow the path of finding new areas of knowledge!  I recommend this course to everyone who is opened to new ideas, new methods, new approaches and challenges! :)Thank you very much for your efforts in creating this course! :) Good luck! :)
I learned a lot, I really learned how humans and even animals learn, as the course name "Learning how to learn", one of the most important skill that I have learned during this course:chunking : which is simply a process of learning something mostly new to you, and keep practicing it over spaced period of time, by doing this you mainly build chunks that by the time will "communicate" with each other which allow you to get a bigger picture of what is going on.
Anonymous completed this course.an honest opinon if u want to learn this is the best course on coursera the bestespecailly the prof barbara she just amazing human being im glad i stumbled upon this course guys if u eager to learn some new concepts about what we study this is the best deal so dont just think just enrolled it thank PROF  barbara so much for making me  understand learning in a whole new dimension and approach of difuse thing mode thank u so much
This is an extra-ordinary course. The instructors are amazingly inspiring and the content is amazing. I specially loved the assessments and spaced repetition of the important learning materials of the course at different point of the course. Learning is a very important tool of our lives and we should all focus on learning better. In my opinion this is one of best courses for that and it is a must to do course for all learners regardless of their disciplines.
I procrastinated taking it for so long. But it is the best MOOC I've ever taken. It teaches you the secrets of neuroscience and psychology of learning in a fun way, with practical methods and concrete examples. 
The course was also an opportunity for me to learn from inspiring people, the Interviewees and scientists from History. 
Big thanks for everyone who contributed to this course.
It was a life changing experience for me!!! 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING IT.
This course is a must for students and teachers alike. As a final year neuroscience PhD candidate I expected to know by now how to learn, yet I got a wealth of advice and new insights. It is a very useful course, with two very good teachers. Not only do they give you great studying and test taking tips, which you can apply immediately (which is why I think teachers should follow this course as well), they give you a lot of scientific background to these tips.
This amazing course is truly a game changer .Quoting Terrence sejnowski "Learning could make people smarter. Learning how to learn is one of the best things one can do in life." I enjoyed taking this course ,this helped me understand what it means to learn better. I would recommend this to everyone. Whatever you wish to learn, from chemistry to dance, these insights will help you learning better. Along with being so informative, this course is truly lively .
This is the best course because this discussed all kinds of techniques to improve oneself to learn something.The best techniques I have learned from this course are Focused Mode and Diffused Mode of learning, and the Pomodoro technique to avoid procrastination. I have also learned how to improve in the examination. Thanks a lot, Dr. Barb Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for making this course easy, and obviously this superb course. Best of luck to both of you!
I have learned so many tips and suggestions from this course. Indeed its a great help not only me as learner but as well as being a teacher. I applaud Dr. Sejnowski and Dr. Oakley for imparting their expertise and love for learning. I also commend their delivery and approach for this course. There were a lot of insightful ideas especially the interviews with some professional who testify and share their experiences which I found very authentic and effective.
A friend suggested to glance through this course during our catch-up. Initially I was a bit apprehensive about this considering that I was not planing to take any more exams. However, this course gave me a pleasant surprise! This course is well structured, and changed my perception of learning. In short, this course is all about a "New Way of Learning". A "must-do" course, no matter whether you are a student, a teacher, a corporate executive or a home maker!
This course provide systematic suggestion on how to become a good learner. First and most important part is belief. Besides belief, it provide tools/techniques proven and supported by scientific research to be useful for learning, very down to earth and useful. For me the most useful technique is keep a working planner, write plan for next day and eat the frog first. I will continue to apply the technique and thanks for the good impact brought by the course.
Thank you Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for this amazing course. Thank you Coursera.This is the best course on learning how to learn. It includes optional interview sessions with great learners, experts in different fields, and a mind athlete. The lectures and quizzes are quite engaging and funny. The course includes lots of beneficial references and helpful material. I would highly recommend this to those who want to learn effectively and efficiently.
This course is amazing!!! I have a new understanding for learning and studying. I will implement these tools for my son and myself. This course will have a profound impact on the people that utilize these tools, I highly recommend this course to everyone and anyone. Share this course to help others shape a wonderful future of learning for themselves.  "Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners." - John Holt
I took this course at age of 48 years. Let me admit that if I had taken this course earlier, I would have performed much better in my studies. I have special thanks for teachers and especially Ms. Barbra. The soft and tender teaching style, convincing arguments and research has helped me a lot to understand well. I shall recommend this course for people of all age. But younger people can take advantage of this course many times more.  Once again Thank you !
A very useful course I've ever had. It explains the techniques with biologic and brain functionality. Make it more convincible than purely re-stating some well known techniques. After finishing the course, I grasped some very useful tools and also answer my puzzles on why sometimes my study is not as efficient as I thought it could be. It greatly improve my study productivity. I'm very confident now that I can learn EVERYTHING!  Thank you so much professor.
I highly recommend! This is very interesting and educational. If you are like me, psychology or neuroscience is not my strength. I had struggled in understand Week One's lessons but found out that the more you listen and practice the information, the easier it gets! I love that I am practicing some of the techniques as early as now. This is course is very helpful and useful not only for students but for everybody. Thanks for the opportunity to learn better!
This course is a must for everyone. It would have changed my life if I had taken it as a teenager, but it still was highly valuably at the age of 31, even being in possession of two BAs, two master degrees and a rich professional life.If you are interested in bettering yourself and learning in general, this course is for you. And here's the beauty of it: if you are not, it will probably make you interested in all those things, so this course is for you too.
Great course in teaching your mind to be flexible and learning new things. Barb breaks down concepts in a fun and realistic way. The optional videos are nicely curated and I highly recommend those. The course helps you stretch your brain. I've employed several of the techniques in my own study path, having gone through a change of careers and back to school at 37.  I'm in the tech education industry as a teacher myself and recruiter and highly recommend it!
I was in bad need  for this course ten years ago when i was in high school it was to make a great difference  in the college i  studied in...but even right now  it is the most important course to start with before go on in any other courses  ,,its the real start point for me  and changed  completely my thoughts and opened my mind  to my real abilities to study what ever i want ..........thanks or professors barbra an trenoski andother team member...........
This was a great course and i hope more people start to use these techniques. Putting this information in the hands of kids when they are young would be very useful. Also elaborating on metaphors and training to use the memory palace would be very beneficial. Creating a video that asks people to walk through there home placing items in a check list all over then quizzing them on how many items they remembered. similar to the book moon-walking with Einstein.
This course was much more useful than I thought it would be. While there were some parts of the videos that gave some of the usual information about learning, there were a far larger that provided useful, actionable information. I particularly liked how short the videos were. That made it easier to consume individual videos and concentrate on them in a relatively short amount of time ... something I could get done during a break from work or something else.
Ill be walking away with Amazing Tools and Techniques from this course, which will make my studies and Journey through life seamless. Then understanding of how the brain functions, Why these techniques work, and the Positive outlook that anyone is able to increase their intelligence through proper application of what is learned in this course.Thank you to both Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski and anyone who had help with this course. Its worth every bit of study.
A well presented, interesting, useful and accessible course that didn’t take too many hours in total but offered a wealth of new learning that made it well worth investing the time.A good mix of video lectures and quiz material, with end of unit summaries that revisited key ideas and introductions that linked previous material with new concepts. Excellent sharing of resource material, too - I have enough additional reading options to last out the year now!
This course helps me a lot in tackling procrastination and make me realized what I've done wrong in my study. The course gives a proper amount of scientific reasons about the brain to support human behaviours and how to deal with them. Every tips and technique taught in the course were also performed and used by course instructors along the way of teaching, and I found those techniques help me a lot in understanding and memorizing the content :) Thank you!
Absolutely wonderful and must-have course for everyone. It provides you the opportunity to learn how to learn directly from leaders in the field. The explanation provide about how memory works are very easy to understand. The techniques explained are simple, easy and come with explanations about why and how they work. Therefore everything makes a lot of sense, is very clear and to the point. All the lessons can be put to use right after finishing a lesson.
This is a very useful course for everyone who wants to learn more effectively, understand complex concepts with less effort, retain information more deeply, and master subjects that even look frightening at first. 
No matter if you are studying languages, physics, or programming, you will definitely find some simple and smart techniques for your everyday use. 
I have just completed the course and I will definitely recommend it to my friends and colleagues.
A very insightful and uplifting course. Thanks to it, I collected several useful to tips to increase the efficiency of my learning sessions (e.g. the Pomodoro technique, giving the priority to self-testing instead of re-reading the study material). And I learned several interesting information about great pioneers in neuroscience such as Ramon y Cajal. I am grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for their commitment in this free course.
Thank you to everyone involved in making this course happening. The information offered is vital to understanding how we learn. In my opinion I have learned and finally understood important concepts of learning that I should have learned earlier in my life. I am very thankful for being one of the participants in this class and would suggest it to anyone! Sad that this is not taught in school before we venture out into the world to become a grown up person.
for many years, I've tried different methods to change the way that I was working and studying, U enrolled this course, I wasn't sure that I'm going to learn something new, after the first week I said woow, I think this is going to work, and it did, it does, it's going to work more, I've learned a lot, this is changed my hole way of learning, getting understanding ourselves, the way that we work, it's the most important step thank you so much, appreciated
I've been learning the whole my life. The whole my life I've been learning in a wrong way, because for some reason or another they don't consider it's worth teaching pupils and students how to learn, which is the first thing I suppose is to be learnt at any education institution. Thank you very much for this course. You have encouraged me to deliver this information to my students. I want to continue working on this topic more deeply at my Master Program.
One of the best courses I have come across on Coursera. What makes this course so great is that Prof Barbara Oakley talks about very simple concepts which most of us "know", yet shows how it is so obvious that we don't really practice them in our lives. What better motivation to finally practice some of these known tips and tools of Neuroscience than to understand WHY - why we do (or don't do) what we do (or don't do), and what can we do to Learn better.
This course broke down 'learning how to learn' into manageable chunks which enabled me to absorb the information easily. It also made me feel more relaxed about taking on challenging subjects and has helped me to reduce barriers to getting started. Barbara Oakley's simple and accessible teaching style made the course enjoyable. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to change bad habits and acquire the right learning skills to better themselves.
This is a great course to help anyone interested in learning. I now understand how to better spend my time studying and that you can learn even those things you don't think your good at. Wonderful help with procrastination and test taking. Not too hard to understand the material and it only takes a bit of work to complete the work and do well on the tests. Anyone can take this course and benefit from it.  Highly recommend taking it, well worth your time.
Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski present the material in a fun, engaging way for a general audience.  I highly recommend anyone take this course for the multitude of techniques explained to aid learning and address issues like procrastination and your mindset if you lack self-confidence to learn.  While the material is focused more toward study and school, there is plenty of benefit for professionals and others looking to continue to learn outside of school.
Before starting any course or learning anything everyone should consider this course first.This course provides some really simple but powerful technique's like the Pomodoro technique, chunking, etc. which can make a noticeable difference in your learning and career too.I would also like to appreciate Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski to be our mentor in this course. There hard work and dedication will benefit many others taking this course.
The course was exceptional and fun!  Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are excellent professors.  The course was well thought out and the interactive quizzes provided an excellent way to learn.  Why aren't all universities offering online courses applying this study method to learning?  I also wanted to mention the guest interviews were fascinating.  I learned so much from all of them. Thank you so much Dr. Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
Schools should teach students how to learn, instead they teach students how to get stressed and fail, then they teach them blame culture. If anyone does well in the pre-university education system in a western country it's usually as much due to accident as design. This course undoes many of the misconceptions that western education systems drill into student's heads. This course will teach you the skills to effectively learn with joy instead of stress.
See "A Posting about Anxiety, Depression and PTSD from a Learner in Learning How to Learn" as my thoughts have been posted previously by a learner. It is comforting to know we share the same experience and I now have the tools to combat decades of procrastination. There were many simple tools given but as stated in the video, the learning environment in academia is based on product not process. I only wish I would have learned this in elementary school.
This course is absolutely amazing, I would even say life-changing. Not only it helps to understand the basics of the brain's nature in terms of learning, but it also helps to embrace yourself, and what's the most important -- to believe in yourself. This is exactly what I so desperately needed in this period of my life. Thank you so much, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. You've done an amazing job creating this course and sharing so many valuable insights.
I am only halfway through this course, but so far it has been interesting, engaging, and useful.  As an educator I am always trying to find ways for myself and my students to learn effectively.  This course has given me some great information (with plenty of citations and options for further reading) as well as useful tools I can use in the classroom.  In addition, Dr. Oakley has a fun personality which really shines through.  Thank you for this course!
This course practices what it preaches. Learning how to learn requires doing the techniques taught on how to learn. It's chunked nicely and gives great real-world examples of how to apply these techniques. Biological and psychological concepts are incorporated which helps to add to realities and destroy misconceptions about learning. Fantastic course, will be taking it again and again over the years to really learn the material and share it with others.
This course gives you amazing insights into our brain working and gives ample technique to change and put to practice different techniques to learn with scientific explanations. It also deals with time management, healthy lifestyle, stress management, test-taking and preparation strategies. It is surprising to know that how doings thing that we have been doing a little bit differently would have given us significant improvement over the results we get.
A course recommandable to anyone. Please take some time to read and view the optional material if you take on this course, they are a wonderful addition.This course has boosted my confidence, as someone with a heavy past of mental illness. As I was going through the course I have become more productive. I also fully gained back my love for learning, and it awakened in me a interest for teaching. I hope I can help many people, as this course did for me.
I have been reading on productivity methods and learning techniques since I was in highschool, but this course glues everything together. It explains the neuroscience behind learning, and by making sense of how our brain works, it gives you the best tips for learning more, and better, and how to be more productive and avoid procrastination. I believe this is a lifelong lesson and I will be very grateful to this course and the instructors in the future.
As a college student, this course forced me to focus on the real truth of studying habits. I hope to use the habits learned from this course to make my college habits better. I have learned how to study and which aspects of studying to focus on. I also realized that most of the time my laziness wins over me and I choose methods of studying that are "harder" but are actually easier and won't learn, than choosing the difficult way and actually learning.
The course content is quite good and it explains things backed with logical explanations, solid research and interesting interviews. The graphics used are not 'the best' but great enough to make you understand things. It is quite evident that a lot of effort has been put in creating the content of this courseI strongly feel that this course will affect the way I learn other things, and is a great way to start with online courses. Strongly recommended.
Thanks to Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley.  This course brings me the useful concepts and techniques on Learning. Some of them we might know it before. But actually we don't understand how the brain function works. By understanding the mechanism, we could build a better leaning skill which means to be more productive. I would love to practice all the skill and try to share with my family and friends. Hope that everyone could learn better and change life.
It's good,i have learned some useful learning skills,and it also give me a new perspective on learning.This course in some sense,changed my way of study.This is also the first class i have taken online.Thank you for your efforts,to give me a graet course.我觉得这门课挺好的，我从中学到了一些很有用的学习技巧，同时它也给了我一个新的方式去看待学习。这门课改变了我的学习方法，我开始做笔记，每天定计划，尽量多使用recall，创建有用的chunk，尽管这才刚刚开始，不过我想我会从中受益的。感谢所有参与这门课程制作的成员，是你们的努力让我有了这次不错的网上课程体验。同时也要感谢翻译的成员，正是有了中文做参照，才让我能坚持下来，完成课程。Thank you.
I took this course because learning is not something I had a clear understanding how the brain works while and away from active learning. It changed my way and actually I am looking forward to take on tough subjects (for me) to apply focussed and diffused modes, add to this a good sleep and the Pomodoro technique!  Thank you so much for the time both Mrs Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski have spent on this course, I am so greatful to youMurielle Hunt
Learning How to Learn is an amazing course, Barbra Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski, both used very calm toned voices that keeps you engaged. The course teaches proven techniques for learning that can be applied to any discipline, while taking this course, I was able to use all the techniques mentioned, on the final project, I found my self procrastinating, and having to use the pomodora technique, All in all a very rewarding course, I highly recommend.
I am a computer scientist. The ideas I learned from this course were mind boggling. During my exams I have been spending all night on preparation without realizing this could have negative effect. I am recommending this course to all my co-worker. This is a meta-learning course which tells how to learn. I have a Ph.D and it is very sad I did not know about this until now. But, it is never too late and there is so much more to learn. Happy Learning :)
Learning How To Learn is a great course for those who aren't sure about their learning tactics like I was before I joined. The professors give plenty of tools to get you ready for your next course. It is amazing! I have learnt so much, being someone who just didn't have any study tricks. I have picked up many techniques and knowledge on how to learn and how my brain works in the process.  This is something I wish I had had or done earlier on in life.
This is a course that I would recommend to everybody, it will allow you to better understand how your brain works, you will also be able to identify bad practices, that are stopping you from really understand and master a certain subject.Barbara and Terry did a great job explaining the concepts in a clear and yet entertaining way.Now that I have completed this course, I have a whole new structure on how face new concepts and how to effectively learn.
What an amazing course! As someone who has been out of college for 5 years, I wish I had taken this class before I started college. It would've helped me tremendously in my studies. Nevertheless, I am really excited that I took this course because this is truly the metaphor "teaching someone how to fish and you'll feed them for a lifetime". Learning how to learn truly "taught me how to fish". Thanks Professor Oakley for putting this course together!
This course exposed me to many new ideas about learning, studying, the brain, and memory. The presentations made the material very interesting and used techniques that made it easier to remember. The use of frequent quizzes and tests definitely helped me learn and remember the material. Both presenters were very good. Barb gave most of the lectures and was very relatable and easy to follow, she really made the course fun to take. Highly recommended!
This course was incredible and it has changed how I approach my life. I am a graduate of chemical engineering and I wish I knew this information when I was in school. I recommend this course for any person who is struggling, interested, or even looking to find a new way of thinking. Any person can take in the vast resources and this is for any student, not just engineers. Thank you Dr. Oakley & Dr. Sejnowski for sharing you knowledge and experience.
Excellent course which teaches a crucial and fundamental skill. The instructors Barbara and Terrence are clearly passionate about the topic; it's reflected in the high quality of the course. I liked all aspects of the course, but I really appreciated all the optional interviews they did. It's great to have so many different perspectives on learning how to learn. I was able to take away something (even if only one or two things) from every interview.
LHTL was a great course that provided me with beneficial study habits with reasoning behind why they worked so well. I am guilty of cramming for a test the night before, which I now regret because I didn't take the time to actually learn the material and create new neural pathways to solidify the knowledge. I wish I had taken this course before graduating college. I would recommend this to anyone getting ready to attend their first college semester.
This was a wonderful course!  I was aware of some of the concepts in learning as I have been an instructor myself for 15 years and took a few Masters classes, but I was amazed at how a lot of this applied not only to learning, but just every day life.  The instructors did an excellent job of explain each of the concepts, and I have a much better understanding of the brain and why we make mistakes in learning.  Overall, I really enjoyed this course.
This couldn't have come at a better time. Excellent course for so many aspects of acquired knowledge. One of the best things I learned was that I would say many already do some form of some of these methods, but lack the confidence to show it. This course accentuates that and is a confidence builder in itself minus the all the additional knowledge involved. I highly recommend to those both young and old in search of a way to see things differently.
One of the best courses for life-learners - those who want to
learn faster and better!The course content is very
carefully selected and designed and the delivery by both Dr. Barbara
Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are awesome. Concepts are demonstrated in way
that learner understands easily.Highly recommended course for anyone who wants to learn more in
life!A Big Thank you Coursera team, University of California and Dr.
Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski.
This course helps identify methods and behaviors that will help you learn and improve memory as well as the key practices to avoid that can harm your ability to learn and understand.  The material could be summarized into a shorter course, but it would not come with the explanation of the reasons WHY the methods work, and it is likely that you will get more value by completing this full course and following the methods outline here with confidence.
When I was starting this course, I already felt that since I've graduated from University with honors, I have nothing more to learn. Since this was a highly-recommended course on Coursera,  however, I still decided to give it a shot. The concepts taught in the course were easy to grasp and the abundance of visual aids really helped in the delivery of the material. I would recommend this course to anyone regardless of educational attainment or age.
I hold a Ph.D. and still very impressed by these classes.I've learned things never thought related to this very underrated area of Academia, at least in my country, which is the processes involved in "learning how to learn".In sum, I just loved this cheerful journey with Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. I'm grateful to them that took this initiative that can reach thousands and thousands of people with multiple backgrounds.Now, let's practice it all!
This is an enormous important course for everyone who wants to improve his learning skills. Throughout our educational career we improve our math skills, language skills, biology skills and more but we never improve our learning, reading and listening skills. That is done by this course! If you want to achieve more in life and make progress in a specific or in different fields, then attend the course and become a well-trained and educated learner!
I enjoyed this class very much. I got a new understanding of learning I sure could've used when I went to school years ago. But as Dr. Barbara points out several times, it's never too late. I especially enjoyed the glimpse into the neuroscience of how we learn. Fascinating! It makes me want to dig deeper.The course is over and I still review my notes and hand write new ones to keep the ideas in my mind.  I am grateful for this course -- thank you.
I am a professional software engineer, who has been out of university for 5+ years. Taking this course gave me insight into how we learn, and how to learn effectively. Even though testing is no part of my life now (outside the annual blood test), learning remains a critical piece of working life. This course helped me get more from the texts I read and re-use pertinent information needed in my daily life. Thanks for helping me learn how to learn!
It is excellent and course,
to show you how to learn effectively and also cope with procrastination. Well
structured course, with each week of the material enables me to apply it right
away. By understanding how our brains work, it allows to take control and
strategize learning. The interviews with various well-known and successful
learners or people at the end of each course week also provide interesting and useful insights
about how they learn.
This course became a part of my day. I began to apply what I learned in my studies and in any work I do. It helped me a lot in learning my unlimited mental skills and how to use them and arrange them. I learned from the course that I have to trust in my new system that I started to arrange my time and to organize my ideas so that I can make full use of it. I really trust and use it and thank everyone who helped to bring it out in this smooth way.
Honestly, This was my first course to finish on coursera. before I used to view some courses and leave them by max 2nd week. But That course content is very attractive. you feel like, every think you are looking for, or you want to have answers for, are ready for you. I would do recommend this course to any one who have problems with time management, procrastination, problems with focusing, bad memory. Thanks Barbara and Sejnowski! really thanks!
Although some students they think it's unnecessary to take such a course, because they have studied since they're born. I don't think so, when people get familiar with somethings, they would become lazy and don't want to change it anymore. This course helps me a lot, I realize I study in an inefficient way and begin to follow this new and efficient way. I also use calendar to plan at the same time. I'm very appreciate for this fantastic course!!!
A very powerful course that made me feel that I am not alone with a lot of issues in memory that seemingly are suffered by many people. Also, the course materials depend on science and experiences which are the fundamental basis of strong and trusted materials. Providing references, the way of explaining some terms and issues, the interviews, and the tests are just amazing and helpful. Thank you, Coursera, and thanks to the tutors of the course.
This was a highly engaging and educational class.  While the theoretical and scientific underpinnings were interesting, the practical approaches to learning is what really appealed to me.  There are so many techniques that I am taking away from this class that I plan to put to use in my learning journey(s).  Prof. Oakley is a great teacher and has a knack for teaching complex things using analogies, metaphors and funny visuals.  Thank you, Prof!
One of the best MOOCs I have ever taken. It is very practical, and can be used in your everyday life.The brain is a powerful tool. We use our brains 24*7, and NOT learning how to effectively use this powerful brain is the single biggest mistake anyone can make.I would recommend this to students, working professionals, teachers, parents of school going children and even to people who are into sports.Join the course! I promise it will be worth it!
It's very useful lecture.It helps me to study more effectively.But as you know, If you do nothing, Any lectures are useless.You should find something actually makes you MOVE.And  in my opinion, that "something" is always in your inside.You don't have to go too far to find "something".If you want to get an answer from a distance, there will be an answer from a distance.But If you want to get an answer from nearby, there will be an answer nearby.
From being a Stay At Home Mom of 54 Years, to being a Student after 36years ... Definitely !!! The most wonderful experience ... The course had so much information, backed by scientific research, step wise explanation, pumped with motivation, making it so very easy to understand,register and remember ( If I got the sequence right).WOW 3 CHEERS for the group of COURSERA ... For making it happen for new Entrants like me, To the world of Learning.
Not only they help people understand better what's "wrong" with our mode of approach something new. They also give you interviews of people, who work in different fields, which talk about how they could go so far only with a basic and solid tool for learning how to learn. I'm a person who procrastinates about everything, also daily life tasks. So I strongly suggest approaching this course to understand better how to manage difficult situations.
Thank you Dr Barbara and Dr Terrrence for such a great course! I used to think that I was good for nothing, but now I see it's just my Zombies, and I can really learn anything if I know how to learn. More than anything else it helped me with procrastination. Believe it or not, using these techniques  I actually had more done during these 4 weeks than I had in the past year! I strogly recommed this course especially to perfectionsts like myself.
This is a great course.  Its easy to understand and the skills taught are useful.  It is like a course refresher for me as the name implies, "Learning to Learn".   I am excited taking the quiz at the end of each topic.  I am a Malay Language teacher and had just completed my Master in Education.  However, after completing this course there is definitely some takeaway for me like example the "Pomodoro Technique".I enjoyed the course.  Thank you!
This course helped in understanding great ways to get stuff done! It is indeed a very refreshing and interesting course and I would highly recommend it to anyone who cares to sharpen his or her skills in terms of optimizing the learning techniques and how to remember and reproduce what we had learned previously. Faculty (teachers who taught and guided during the course) are subject matter experts and I think it was a good investment of my time!
This should be one of the first MOOCs course to take followed by philosophy, so you can really think and your passion or work related. I really enjoy this course because one of the best toolkit for my studies or work or generally life. Also really inspirational, because this shows that everyone can learn and Coursera and all the MOOCs are helping tons of people without the opportunities. Thank you for this wonder course! You can learn anything!
excellent course, would like to thank Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski and the team of learning how to learn. They have introduced learning in a whole new perspective which is fun and scientific. You get to learn about how to learn both actively and passively. Excellent lessons in a planned and systematic manner which is filled with fun quizes and activities. My only regret is not taking the course during my freshman year at college!
This course is excellent. One of the best course I did in my life. Tips like pomodoro, deliberate practice, gave me deep insights on to how we really learn and master subjects. More importantly, this course now gave me the confidence that I can learn anything with an attitude of learning even though I have no talent/interest towards it. Thanks for the instructors , for taking the time and putting it all together and giving it free via coursera.
Great course. Things that EVERYONE should know are presented in such a great way. Prof. Oakley's voice sounds so calm, but yet persuading, she really knows how to teach. Dr. Sejnovski brought great facts about how that complex machine called brain works, but in a very understandable manner. Course production is great: sound, images, just everything. I will surely visit most of additional material too, there are very interesting clips and texts.
I loved this course very much it was fun going through the very helpful and entertaining contents for 4 weeks. I enjoyed Barbara Oakley's lovely sense of humor and Terrance Sejnowski's grate insights. I didn't knew learning could be so fun. Now this course has broadened by perspective in gaining new skills and has encouraged me to learn more, Now I know that I can learn anything if I just put my focus and diffuse mind at work. THANKS A LOT !!!
A Truly Brilliant course that takes you into the mechanics of learning to learn , unlearning and re-learning techniques and strategies for deeply integrated knowledge assimilation and retention.What really interested me was the interactive lectures, self-reflective videos and assessment sections as well as the overall way in which the course is structured. Definitely worth recommending to anyone looking for Deep Learning practices and skills!!
Best course I've ever found on Coursera. Awesome material!! Best instructors Mrs. Barbara Oakley and Terrance Sejnowski, I've  ever learnt from. It has helped me change my bad mental habits a lot. After completing this course, I felt that if somebody had made me understand these exciting things which I learnt from this course in my childhood I would've never wasted my time learning in the wrong way.  Thanks a lot for this super awesome course.
A fantastic course, full of creative and useful ideas. It was just perfect from the simple English language used, excellent illustrations to the highly qualified lecturers. All in all, a very good course to recommend. Thank you for the efforts to make this course freely accessible to everybody. Thank you for sharing personal experiences. Thank you for adding that much of info to my knowledge bank. I hope meet you soon on another useful course.
Taught all of the basic essentials in how to learn; I myself learned a lot. I would however have liked a "real life" set of examples showing how what was taught would change or fit into the workflow of an actual student. For example, it could show how a student using the knowledge in the course vs. an average student would go about their coursework (reading assignments, homework, tests, essays, etc.)Thank you so much for providing this course!
I very much enjoyed this class, and found practically all of it highly useful. My daughter is about to go to college so I was sure to be an annoying momma and share with her all the tips and tricks even tho she is so very sure she knows it all already ;-) The tips for stopping procrastination in its tracks were wonderful, and the idea that "practice makes *permanent*" rather than *perfect* was rather eye-opening. I highly recommend the course.
Amazing course. Videos very well done,  easy to grasp all concepts (not because I'm smart but because the instructors are), charming, warm, kind, fun and extraordinarily knowledgeable instructors. This is very important knowledge taught with total mastery of the subject. This course should really be compulsory reading for schools all over the world! I can't thank the instructors enough, I learned so much and they are both such a joy to watch!
A very useful study. For some time I was looking for a way to overcome procrastination, change my habits, including mental habits, and during the course I found the best solutions that worked right away. Everyone should complete the "Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects" course. The course is well prepared and led by the best teachers Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. Thank you very much.
It was fun doing this course. I am now known to new techniques of learning. It is amazing and I have enjoyed it. I learnt many techniques to be applied for better learning and I will continue to do so further when I am learning. Thanks to Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for such a great guidance and for being wonderful instructors! I am happy to learn more from you. And yes happy after doing such an interesting course. Thank you!
This course has been an eye-opener...the research behind brain science, memory types and how we can get smarter in the way we learn, is impressive. Importantly, the concepts are relevant and applicable in our daily work, both as students and as professionals.I highly recommend this course to everyone who is looking to improve their learning abilities. I wish I had understood these concepts much earlier in life...however, it's never too late!!
As taught in this course its not about getting excited about new ideas , its about how we implement it in our life . I have got scientific explanations for many of my doubts regarding learning , memory and habits. I really loved the course and its recommended to everyone regardless of age and profession and field of their interest. I like definitely apply the learned techniques into my day today life and hope i will make me a better learner .
I was really happy that I took this course. I made me see areas where I could improve my learning as well as provide me with new ideas that would help me in learning. It also showed me that I have two different modes of thinking, and the functions of each. I recognised how important it is to give each a chance in the learning process. All in all, a very informative and excellent course! Thank you for helping me learn how to learn even better.
This course is so fundamental to education that we should teach it to students in 4th grade. It would make a difference to our collective knowledge base. I think every college freshman would benefit by taking this course in the first semester. It was well designed and practiced the skills it taught - spaced repetition, recall, testing for example. The extra reading resources were excellent and enhanced and reinforced what the course offered.
This is an excellent course for anyone to complete. Prior taking this course, I was hesitant since these topics have been preached to students for a million times. Yet I decided to go for it. To my amazement, its really been a life changing course.I would like to thank professor Oakley and professor Sejnowski for explaining the material in a simple and effective way, not only highlighting the challenges but also providing solutions for them.
This course will help me in a lot of ways. I realized a lot of things that I have been doing the past days were just simply wrong. I didn't have a remarkable change in my daily routine on what I was doing as I finished the course yesterday. I am sure slowly slowly I will change my habits and I will learn faster and retain more information in long term.Thank you Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence for helping me out and lot of other people out there
This course was incredible.  I learned so many useful, practical ways to improve my learning.  Both professors did a great job communicating their content in ways that were interesting and informative.  I especially liked the addition of the interviews.  Having the honors assignments challenged me even further.  I'm going to teach these skills to my students now.  Please sign up for this class right now.  You cannot afford to wait any longer
An incredible course! I advice it to EVERYONE: not only for students, but to everybody wanting to improve his/her memory skills, ability to fight procrastination and concentrate on whatever you are doing at a speific moment. The lecturers are the nicest professors I've ever seen in my life! I really would like to meet them and to thank for the work they do.  Barb and Terry - you are my love, indeed! Good luck and happy learning how to learn!
I am a working professional, not in academia. As an individual who believes in "life-long learning", I found the information and strategies in this course to be broadly applicable to life in general.  The session on dealing with procrastination  (focusing on process over product) was particularly eye-opening for me. I also found the discussions on how the brain works in relation to learning and memory  to be highly beneficial. Great course!
It's a good topic of all like: - student,reader and public speaker and any body who want to learn the learning process.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thank You,                                                                                                   HIMADREE BHUSAN SAHOO
This is a very practical course, in which the instructors not only teach about the theory behind learning but also provide pragmatic techniques to help you foster your own learning. Personally, I find both of the instructors a bit awkward, but in a very cute way. Also, they don't just talk the talk, they also walk the walk. Very inspiring and enlightening course to talk for anyone who is interested in improving their own learning abilities!
Amazing course!! I can't wait to try and put it to practice with the new academic year.My only regret is that a lot of the topics talk about "problem solving" and I'm still a little unclear as to what to do when what you're studying has seemingly nothing to do but is mostly about trying to remember facts, and dates, and definitions.I guess I'll have to get started and see how I can apply the techniques of this course in my new student life!
Wonderful instructors, truly engaging course!  Learning How to Learn has given me a new confidence in pursuing and mastering quantitative subjects necessary for me to secure the career in healthcare that I have always dreamed about, but was never sure about.  I've already seen amazing results with my current science courses and will be sure to use and share the techniques highlighted in the course throughout the rest of my life.  Thank you!
Excellent course about learning methods that can easily be worked with during ones learning projects. The overall course is very motivating and the way of presentation by Dr. Oakley as well as her co-presentors is done in a very comprehensive and illustrative way. I would highly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning new things in a very efficient and long-term way.Many thanks for providing this great online course!!
I really enjoyed Learning How to Learn. It was full of great strategies and has helped me pass a demanding professional exam that i had been struggling with for the previous three years.I have purchased the companion book for this course, and even the children's version by Dr Oakley, to have a refference of the matrerial and to share this with my own children.I will continue to follow the work of Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
This is an excellent course on how humans learn and retain information. I think this should be essential learning for every student. It has changed how I approach learning and I find new skills to practice every week throughout the course.Take some time to go through the course and learn how you can more effectively retain information. I found it to be extremely helpful in my life of learning and it has changed the way I approach learning.
I appreciate the opportunity to take this course as it will help me a lot when I study my other courses and it will help me in my general life too. In this course I've learned lots of things about how to learn, how to memorize the information that I learned, how my brain works and how to use my brain to learn with more efficient.You guys really should take this course if you want to be more efficient and productive in school or university.
The class was different from what I expected. I love how sourced the individual videos were. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone taking this course to take it slowly and do notes video by video. Only one thing I saw weird was the small typos and inconsistency in the notes format! It didn't really matter much in terms of the content, the only thing that could be improved from a simple point of view is that because the content is impeccable.
I luckily overheard some very smart software engineers who sit near my cubicle talking about how great this course was for them. I must say after completing this course, I feel reinvigorated to learn more than ever. Both complacency and procrastination are two vices I'm now ready to let go of! Thank you Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terry Sejnowski, the Learning How To Learn team, and Coursera for developing and delivering such an outstanding MOOC!
How do you prepare for an exam? Well, all we have different ways for that, but this course helps you get very efficient techniques for a good learning. In addition to this, you will have very good explanations about how your brain works, and wich habbits help it building good knowledge. Finally, the instructors are masters in their respective fields  of knowledge, what else you need? Please take this course asap, you wont be dissapointed.
Amazing Course.  "Learning How to Learn" ought to be a personal pre-requisite to all the other courses.  By Learning How to Learn, we make learning more effective. I thoroughly enjoyed how the course was presented and laid out.  The course applied all the principles it teaches.  And, the bonus material attached is very pertinent, interesting, and joyful to view. Especially the student that learned many languages. Great course!  Thank you!
Awesome course! Learning is explained in simple terms and the tips and best practices really stick to your memory. The course has definitely achieved what it is teaching - which is making sure you remember the material by testing yourself and by utilizing spaced repetition. I loved the simplicity of the course. Make sure you watch all optional interviews as they are with people who achieved great results in the area of learning or memory.
A great course! This course provides a comprehensive coverage of different learning techniques, as well as different theory behind 'learning how to learn.' The instructors are enthusiastic, and provide many different backgrounds to learning -- the neurological, biological, and psychological aspects of learning are are covered. A good course to compete for anyone who wants to improve their ability to learn new things and think critically.
A wonderful course and one that I would (and will) recommend to anyone staring any learning journey! If you are planning on beginning a learning journey - it makes sense to pack your bag with the best tools and techniques to make that journey productive and fun!That's what this course does! It equips you to make the most of your time and effort in Coursera and elsewhere. Take this course first - learn the techniques - revisit and review.
The course, in short, was an eye-opener to me. The title of the course justifies the course itself and I pretty much enjoyed myself doing this. I was reminded that it's okay if you are not the smartest one in the room and yet you can still contribute abundantly! I've added so many learning tools to my arsenal and I'll efficiently use them! Thank you to the instructors for such a wonderful course and I hope other students find it useful!
It is a great course, and I can learn many things which significantly changing my perspective about learning.  I have contemplated my learning process and found not only a different angle but also a different way to learn effectively. The product is still the focus, and procrastinating is a dominant part of my life before.  Your course gave me the answer.   Enjoy the learning process because everyone has the own way. Thank you, Barbara.
I think every high school student and new undergrad students will benefit from this. It's nice and short, and easy to understand. The concept of "Chunking" might confuse you at first, but just think of it as a bit of knowledge you gain about a subject; e.g. You learn about how bicycle gears work; that's a chunk. You learn about photosynthesis; that's a chunk. You learn how hierarchy matters in the Korean language Hangul; that's a chunk.
Great course! Great tips! It's incredible how people dedicate themselves to help others and you can see this in this course. Even though you think you master how to study, you never know enough and there's always a way to learn more and more. With this course and wonderful instructors you can find out more about how your brain works, and how you can improve your learning techniques (and throw others away that you think it is effective).
This was the first course I have ever taken online and although I have nothing to compare it to, I absolutely loved it! I've never been able to stay focused or have the discipline to finish any type of education and I managed to finish this, staying interested the entire way through! I loved the material, the two professors and how they executed the work and lessons. This course is so helpful and such a motivational boost, thank you! <3
This course has teach us  the best learning skill. The Pomodoro technique is a good keys for us to complete our hard task and overcome Procrastination. Fews skill that really inspiration are practice make prefect, promodoro, focus & diffuse, wirking memory, concept for learning step and focus attention and the last is the value of teamworks.I foreseen after this we are more able to complete our reading or working task more efficiently.
Beats all the books I've read on the topic, hands down. Superb learning course that is as hands-on practical as you could want. Excellent instructors, with an excellent presentation of materials. Instructor puts into practice the elements of learning to reinforce what is being taught. My only regret is that this course wasn't around when I was a spring chicken but our understanding of how people learn was wrong at that time. Thank you!
Thank you very much, this course was very helpful for me, I finished my university studies and I had to leave my country because of the war and I could not continue my caree in the new country , this course showed me that it did not stop at this point and I can follow up and even learn the field complitly different, also gave me a lot of tips that will help in learning a new language (and this is something I need for now). thanks again
Great course! It gets a bit repetitive in the last week and starts to become a self-help course on studying if you enjoy studying. But that doesn't overshadow the general positive and scientific content on how to deal with learning. I am already applying the techniques and now understand better how to approach my studies. I am really thankful for the advices, the techniques and the plain language used by instructors. Great experience.
What a wonderful and empowering experience! this course has been! As Professors Oakley and Sejnowski eloquently stated in the summary, for too long we have focused on the product and not the process of learning. Using a fun, engaging and accessible approach, they teach how anyone can learn more effectively. Highly recommend for learners (and leaders) of all ages. A must for educators who are interested in developing lifelong learners.
The course is excellent for all types of people- students, teachers, working professionals, house-makers, retired people and more. its presented in a very lucid style -simple and engaging. The course draws upon various scientific findings which are weaved to present a whole picture. The course presents many learning strategies which are easy to implement. in fact the course itself uses these strategies to make learning very effective.
I learned so much about my brain and the processes imperative to seeing how I can learn things in a short amount of time and with a strong understanding. I have been and will use the strategies outlined in this course throughout my life to not only learn quicker, but also to do things that I would not have done without the class. This is because our brains naturally prohibit some things unless an effort is made to change those things.
it's a useful guide on how to work with your own brain in case of any type of learning including new languages, different subject or whatever you are attempting to do. it's a pity i didn't have a chance to pass this course, when i was in a high school or even earlier, it could be a great support for my studying.teachers of the LHTL are absolutely great, they give a clear view on the subject with lots of evocative metaphors and images.
One of the greatest courses I've ever taken! The professors explained the material well and in depth, and gave lots of practical tips we could start using immediately. The course was also built up in a way that it was easy to remember the material, and we were quizzed only on the actually important parts. What's more, it gave me loads of motivation and enhanced my love of learning. I would recommend this course to literally everyone.
A lot of the stuff I knew already, but didn't realise how effective they were and how I was taking the wrong approach to implementing them. The concept of Einstellung and Interleaving my studies within the same pracistise sessions has really helped me understand my flaws when approaching learning. Overall it was a success, following the tips in the course I have managed to curb my procrastination for good...hopefully. Would recommed!
Great material, well presented.  The delivery is in bite size pieces making it easy to fit around a busy schedule.  It delivers on the class description of learning how to learn with practical, apply immediately concepts as well as helpful background and context of the science behind the ideas and recommendations.I highly recommend this course for anyone that is still learning and growing in their lives - which hopefully is everyone!
I enjoyed the course very much. I like the learning methods and techiniques taught with scientific knowleadge and evidence. I also enjoyed the fun presentation style (zombies, pinball, fun pictures, etc.) that drew my attention. I also highly recommend that people listen to the optional interviews. I have learned a lot from the interesting experiences of people who were interviewed by Dr. Oakley.  Have fun with learning how to learn!
I've been going through a series of enrolling and giving up on this course for years, and by doing that I wasted many opportunities to learn how to learn properly and I could've avoided many mistakes I made during these years.This has been a pleasure to attend, it was very informative. One thing that could improve are the videos themselves, I think that they need a visual refresh because they look somewhat dated, otherwise top-notch!
This course has help me overcome my greatest obstacle procrastination and improve my self-study for life long learning. I wish I had found that course back when I was taking my Electrical Engineering courses. It would make a huge difference on time I invest on studying. Thank you both Professors, teaching assistant and all who help me this course possible free at cost for us to improve our life. This is amazing course to take.Ousmane
As someone who did really horrible in his undergrad and now fighting to make redemption on master's, taking this course was one of the few right decisions I have made so far in life. The instructions were clear, the topics were meaningful and I have learned to look at my academic materials in a new way. I have just started a new semester and I am excited to face the challenges with everything I have learned here. Thank you very much.
Many thanks to Terry and Barbara for their generous spirit in sharing and showing  how   the brain learns. I am  58 and have gained an understanding of how my brain learns as well as  skills and techniques to tap this potential. I have noticed already an increased ability to recall and learn material. It is reassuring to have a learning structure and plan that is effective as I seek to learn Te Reo Maori.  Ka nui te aroha ki a korua.
This class taught me powerful learning, studying and test-taking material: the strategies, tips, mind-sets and routines that I need to become a powerful and effective life-long learner. I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their study habits, and the quality of their lives in general! Now I feel more confident in tackling different or unfamiliar subjects. The material in this course is invaluable for your life "toolbox"!
The professors utilize their exceptional and diverse backgrounds to both inspire and instruct in this course. Not to mention Barb clearly implements the very concepts she is teaching about learning throughout the course, making it engaging and easier to learn! I highly recommend this course. There is certainly something for anyone to take away from this course, whether you are a struggling student or a contemplative mindfulness guru.
This was an amazing course full enthusiasm and knowledge! I learned a lot of thing about how my brains work and how I can have an influence on how I can study better. I learned so much in 4 weeks than I learned in 1 year at school. This course is very important for everyone. Everyone has to go to school to study, but no one actually learned how to study. I recommend this course for everyone, young and old. You are never old to learn!
It helped me try new things and revealed to me a wealth of information that otherwise would still be unknown to me if not for me enrolling in this course. It was also made more friendly to us youth because of analogies on zombies and vampires :)One thing that I was slightly bothered about was the volume of the videos. Maybe an increase in volume would make it less hard for people who have to access Coursera in noisy places to listen.
I've studied only one week in this course and is fasinated, why? Becouse it explain the big concept about HOW the brain works in relation with the knowlegde. I'm mechanical engineer (from colombia) and I'm studying english in Boston Mass. This experience has been amazing but sometimes I've felt frustrated, it's not easy. I think "Learning how to learn" will help me to improve my skill while I save time studying. Thanks you very much.
I have not ever listened so impressive, interactive, detailed course with good examples, intermediate tests after each unit, high-organized and filled of different vision and opinions of very interesting persons from an education, science, publicism etc. I was very delighted to watch all optional interviews as well. The lecturer is so precise with her explanations, therefore any non-native english speakers would understand it at all.
This class has been inspirational and informative to me! It gives me strategies and tools to overcome some of the things that have impeded my constant learning. I will keep myself informed of what goes on in relation to learning how to learn. My time in the four-week journey to learning how to learn turns out to be one of the best moments in 2015. I hope that that moment keeps making impacts on my future learning. Thank you so much!
Excellent course.I have been mostly self taught most of my life. And still this course had many ideas that were new to me, and some that i had a hunch on but could never really phrase or explain to myself or others. I have implemented some of the advices given in the course and can say that at least for me they work perfectly. There's no doubt my learning and productivity will improve with the new knowledge this course has given me.
It must be fate to stumble upon and took this course, as I am a student who procrastinates and struggles to learn how to really learn. Thank you for your lectures and tips :) I have found myself relating to the methods I'd been doing wrong in learning new things; Thankfully, through the help of your interesting, educational, and encouraging course I have changed my perspective on learning how to learn. Truly an eye-opening journey.
I had selected this course randomly among the recommendations from a youtuber. and i had just joined this course to know what it is. But this course has taught me many valuable things about learning and about mind. I came to know about how we learn new things and can also improve the learning. Thank you the team for this nice work. I am implementing the things that i learn on this course while learning new skill. Thank you so much.
Amazing course. I tried this one out for a way to see what courses are like to take, mostly for college prep and such. However, I got much more than I had planned for, in a positive way. The teachers are very understandable, the content is extremely helpful inside and outside the classroom, and the extra content is great to dive into. I love all of it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their studies by tenfolds.
Excellent course, a very nice experience.  I was a little worried that a subject so vulnerable to subjective analysis might consist of pseudo-science and politically correct agendas, but I was pleased to discover that the exact opposite was true--the course concepts were presented clearly, memorably, and with entertaining methods and the facts presented were well researched and referenced. Thank you for putting this course together
An incredible course!. For me was an eye opener and an inspiration. The fear of not being able to learn things that to me are difficult has dissipated. I feel empowered! Barbara is an fantastic teacher. She really knows how to have her material understood. She makes it interesting and absolutely fun!. I was always looking forward to the videos and tests. Thank you so much! I know how my brain works, so I can tackle it the right way
Both Barbara Oakley & Terrence Sejnowski are great faculties. They love what they are teaching.  They communicate very eazily tough concepts.  They are doing a great job.  The bonus courses are great too.  I would recommend this course to anyone interested in some serious concepts about learning.  Thank you both very much &  a big HIG FIVE to your supporting faculties.  Thank you Everyone & Coursera team too for making this happen
从这门课中，我学到了很多知识，怎么运用专注模式和发散模式，怎么对付拖延症，怎么创建组块，习惯的四要素等等，最让我印象深刻的还是一个语言学习者说，厉害的人也曾经历过你所经历的一切，所以，不要放弃，继续加油。  From this course, I learned a lot of knowledge, how to use focus mode and diffuse mode, how to deal with procrastination, how to create a set of chunks, habits of four elements, etc., the most impressed me was said a language learner, strong people have experienced everything you experience, so, don't give up, continue to refuel
This is probably the best course that I have done in my life. This is an essential for any one in the world of today. The course is going to be taken by my children. Prof Barbara O was phenomenal, an example of person walking the walk and talking the talk. This was easily the most valuable course done in my life and needs to be done by every body. Most pleased with way the course was run --and the demonstrable value I got from it.
As a high school math teacher, I am always looking for ways to assure students are equipped with the methods and procedures they need to succeed. The science presented in this course is proving to be directly applicable to my students.The course was entertaining and enlightening. I routinely share data from this course in professional development meetings and with my students as I explain the changes I have made in my instruction.
This has been one of the best courses I've taken in my life. The insight, knowledge, and techniques you learn about the brain and how to learn have changed the way I study and approach things and are proving to have immediate benefits in my life. I definitely would recommend this course to anyone who is studying anything, and to everyone in general as all the concepts and knowledge can pretty much be applied in all areas of life.
Dear Drs. Barbara and Terrance,I appreciated you shared your knowledge to understand  and learn about the available resources in our brain, and the different techniques to improve our skills to learn different topics.I highly recommend to read the "A mind for numbers" book during and after this course, it is very easy to understand and it is a great supplement for the class.Thank you so much for all your work and congratulations.
Great course to learn new study skills and understand why what you might be doing isn't helping.  My first week of my math class I spent nearly 20 hours studying and now I spend only around 5 hours a week and retain more using the techniques mentioned.  I still have room to improve too!  (Although the amount of time probably won't drop any more, I will probably be able to retain the information better once I get flashcards down).
Best thing I've done in years! Feel really prepared and actually excited about some upcoming study. Barb is brilliant ... the regular quizzes are really helpful in cementing your understanding and the humour smattered throughout is so clever! Thanks for the confidence boost ... I have a totally different level of understanding and appreciation for what is truly possible. Seriously... this course is a game changer - thank you!!!!!
Just the perfect course I have been wanting to learn, Learning How to Learn.:) At the end of this course,  I am hoping to be able to apply all what I have learned in my coming up subjects in the next semesters to come and all the days of my life. Bravo to all involved in putting up on line such straight forward easy to learn techniques on Learning How to earn all my subjects and every single thing involving Learning How to Learn.
I would recommend to individuals from all walk of life. Its so motivating, easy to comprehend and addresses our basic issues in learning tough things. It has provided with simple tips that can be used in our daily life. I am using them and results are tremendous. Above all, it has given me an insight that we can master things that we are not naturally good at. I am extremely thankful to the instructors and Coursera! Stay blessed.
This is an excellent course, and I recommend it to every student and every graduate and anyone else who doesn't mind it when they take their coat out the closet on the first cold day of the year and discover a $20 bill that they didn't know they had. That is, many will discover in this course capabilities that they had all along, but were unaware of.  It is free!  My advice is to dive in, get started, and see where it leads you.
Pretty good course. I got a few techniques and habits/routines out of it, which I plan to adopt. On the critical side, I usually like my material free of zombies and pinball machines, but that's me. I feel the zombie analogy is handy during the course, but falls short as you move on to more advanced understanding. Also, I would remove "easy" from the answer to 21 d (I think that was the question).But overall, a very good course.
It was great for people like me cause when so ever I got fail in some subjects I used to think that I'm a talented person it's not my fault, I used to blame the teacher for these but after these course I'm getting to think that I'm the one who was lacking with the skills how to learn.Everything about these course is way too great.Thanks to the team of coursera and especially to Prof. Barb Oaklay and Prof. Terence. Thanks A Lot.
My first course in Coursera, and i am so glad that i started with this one. Both professors are so kind, teaches so understandably. I am very happy that i completed this course, there are so much information! Also that tasks that can be done voluntarily, they waked up my competetive skills! It was extremely fun and informative, i am thankfull for that opportunity! Thank you VERY MUCH for helping people to Learn How To Learn!!!!
Despite my near-zero knowledge of English and contrary to test tasks in English, I successfully completed this course.I learned a lot of interesting things for successful training and new skills.Of course, on the whole, I spent about five times as much time on the course, but from about 2-3 weeks, using the advice I received, the training skills and habits I received allowed me to take tests the first time and with high scores.
It was my maiden MOOC and I am glad that I chose this course. It is one of the greatest things that I have learned in my recent days. The illustrations are lively, the examples most appropriate and an absolutely knowledgeable, creative, enthusiastic,funny and experienced instructor Barbara Oakley has made this course simply astounding and will act as a light to illuminate the path of all those for whom learning seems difficult.
This course was something I looked forward to each day this summer.  Dr. Oakley's calming voice and all the research done by her and Terrance was thorough and simplified (compact).  I feel that I can apply so many concepts into my job, my health (procrastination), my dreams to accomplish many more academic feats in my lifetime.  Many thanks for the post-lesson cue, "I'm Babara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn"  Best, HT
Thanks a lot, Terrence Sejnowski & Barbara Oakley!!!By your commitment I have learn a lot of how to handle learning of new things!I am deeply grateful to you for having the patience to try to learn me all this new knowledge about how our brains works when we force it to learn new things! I will have this in my mind when it gets hard, sometimes to learn new things!Thank you both very much!!! And it have been funny!Kjell Karlsson
Thanks. The course "Learning how to learn" is realy helpful. I am from Venezuela, and I want to be a writer in english. I know I have some difficulties with irregular verbs and with punctuation. After this course, I started to try daily with those problems.I am interested in "learning and motivation", And this course has good bibliography about it. I agree with Schopenhauer idea that Motives are the causes views from within us.
Many thanks to the instructors and university for making this course available.  It pointed out some of the flaws and limitations in my learning methods.  More importantly, it gave me a road map to improving my learning and long-term comprehension of subjects.  I am already using my new developing skills to improve reading comprehension, learning newer complex materials, and being generally more efficient in work and learning.
This course was fantastic. I wish I was aware of all these hints and tips many years ago, however, glad to have been taught these now. Barbara and Terry thank you, as you have provided so many valuable tools to be able to learn more efficiently and understand those tougher concepts. You will change many peoples lives with your courses, most likely you have done so already. I look forward to your books and the following courses
Great course! After completing a three-course MOOC certificate earlier this year, I realized I needed help studying and retaining information. I learned about this course via The Odin Project, signed up the same day, and completed it within two weeks. I find the presentations, techniques, recommendations, and optional videos very helpful. I'm using the techniques to learn CSS and HTML. I appreciate it being available for free.
Truly outstanding and eye opening course.   It has been a couple of months now...and am thinking about going through the material once again (to Chunk all the good stuff I was exposed to in the course).Have shared the course to my Senior Management.  While they are all good people I think many of have forgotten the joy and art of learning.  I really believe it will be good exposure for them to go through the course themselves.
I am a woman in my late 50s who has been limited in my life, my education, and my employment by lack of confidence in my ability to learn math.  In Summer 2016, I will complete all of the classes for a BS degree,  all but two math classes.  After completing Learning How to Learn, I am confident that, while math may be a challenge, it is a challenge I will overcome.Thank you for sharing these learning tools with the rest of us!
Wow. This course is great. After just the first couple of videos my brain starting working on how to approach other areas of study differently--much more efficiently. The spacing of material is something I had already know, but the reaffirmation of having to push through has been cemented in my mind. And now I know that that is precisely learning... it entails some degree of being uncomfortable. Thanks. Keep the goods rolling.
By far the best course I did in my entire life ! I learned how to deal with a big range of problems that in one way or another everyone deal with. It doesn't matter If you are doing great in school or college or you are flunking, you will learn something new from this course. I found incredible how effective the techniques presented here work and why anybody never told me this techniques before. 5/5 recommended for everyone !
An essential course for all ages and disciplines. Truly beneficial to anyone learning any thing throughout his/her whole life. It includes how the brain works and how to use it efficiently; how to be productive and how to avoid procrastination; how to concentrate and how to memorize; and most importantly some tools and techniques. What is also worth noting is the concise and direct instructors. I highly recommend this course.
damn good,i wish i could had all this info 30 and more years ago, indeed my past study methods are full of this error (and i really am surprised i have some sort of success... too bad i can't go back in time, but i will try to be better in any study i will do!) thanks a lot to teachers, clear and perfect english speaking (i'm italian and had no problem in understanding their speech.)i suggest to do this course to all i could.
For full-time students and lifelong learners, this is the perfect course to add powerful tools to imporve deep learning. Being an experienced meditator, I could easily relate with the concepts of alternating focused mode and diffused mode learning. These are the very same concepts we use in the monastery. Eg: Timing your walks and sits (for instance 20min Walking meditation and 20 min Sit) and follow it by a 15 mins of break.
This course will help you develop a strong sense of how you learn. It will teach you about the neurological mechanisms of memory and skill development, as well as give you some critical strategies, tools, and tips so that you can take control of how you learn. Barbara and Terrence are fantastic professors and this was an awesome course that has changed the way I look at my own education, both within the classroom and outside!
It is a very informative and entertaining course, where every lesson you get great advice for truly learning things more effectively. I have heard about the pomodoro technique before but combined with the more scientific (and fun) explanations i was convinced to try it out, and i think that is the best part about this course, and it is that I finish motivated to keep applying the tips and tricks learned here. Thanks a lot :)
This course simply i consider one of the most powerful courses i have ever taken, also I have gotten enormous information out of this and this what i am planning to apply in my new life career. Finnaly the new skills i have learned are unforgetable and so ease to grasp and apply. One last thing learning how to learn wasn't only a course for me it was a part of mine now. Thank you drs for your efforts through the whole course
This course really helped me to figure out how to learn.  I wanted to learn things in the past, start a course but drop interest halfway through. I wish I came across this course at least a decade back. Never the less I have a lot more to learn. Now I know how to learn effectively without dropping the interest. Thank you so much, Professor Barbara Oakley. They way she explained was amazing. I wish I meet here in my lifetime.
The course comprehensively covered the main areas of how to learn, in an interesting, easy to understand way. The videos retained your interest and the content was both interesting but extremely helpful. The instructors are fantastic and the optional reading and information contains a significant amount of information, which I would definitely recommend accessing. Overall, a fantastic course that I would strongly recommend.
overall this course is brilliant as the content is very well structured and clearly explained. I really like how most how the concepts are explained through graphics and metaphors, and i feel close to the two teachers. one thing I would like to point out is that the last part of the 4th week learning is not exciting as the first three weeks as it's very focused the practical tips for tests, which I am already familiar with.
I believe that this course has given me a better understanding of how my brain works, and how can I make the most out of it. This course also pointed out the harmful habit I do during studying and learning, how can I avoid these harmful habits and replace them with beneficial ones. I will start applying all the the techniques I learned during this course to enhance my learning experience and change my life to a better one.
What Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski, the educators, have done is breathtaking. This course gives such a great insight into how the brain works and how to overcome obstacles or illusions and therefore think more effectively, it is awesome. The only detail to improve is the subtitles, I was using Spanish subtitles and sometimes they were incomprehensible, not to mention that they were not in alignment with the speech.
Fantastic class. A lot of materials could be considered common knowledge or basic, but the course was very upfront about that. I fact, I believe that it was necessary in order to cater to a wide range of audiences and to benefit as many people as possible. While I didn't find the course to be challenging, I did take away a couple tools and tricks that will continue to benefit me throughout the lifelong journey of learning.
This is a wonderful course for any person who is interested in learning how to learn effectively. I highly appreciate the LHTL team's efforts to design the course content in such a way that person from any discipline is able to understand the concepts easily. In one word this was an awesome beginning to the effective learning journey. A big thank you to LHTL team! I am definitely going to share this course with my friends.
A brilliant course, i should complete it way earlier! The learning tips are so useful, it seems to me i'm automatically applying some of them already. Trying to implement mind maps for everything like presentation for work, a book presentation meeting etc, found this tool to be very useful. After making a mind map i can easily recall the whole speech or idea behind it! Still need to inhabit the chapter 4 tips into my life.
I am a language teacher so I knew about chunking and SRS, but the rest of the material was new to me. Great explanations with solid graphics and the right energy make this a valuable course. It helps me with my own learning and also when teaching others. This is good to anyone, but it would be especially helpful for university students who want to do better, who already have the drive, but are lacking some valuable tools.
Barbara mam and Terry sir .....You were amazing.....!!!!!!! Barbara mam......You were really like my own teacher and I went into my kindergarten days...!!! Whenever I see you on screen...I get enthusiastic...I was struggling with learning problems....This course was really useful....This course must be taken by everyone....Now I have this confidence that I can learn any new thing that is unrelated to me...Smart isn't it;)
My company decided to move everyone around and I was placed in an environment where I had to learn a new field. It's been a long time since I was in school and the learning process was not going well. I saw this course course and figured maybe there's something I've forgotten or never learned about learning. There is a lot I never understood about learning! I encourage others to take this course and find out for yourself.
Highly informative, fun, and engaging for a course that's very meta -- Professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski present the subject matter in a way that anyone can easily relate, whether they came from a science or an arts/humanities course. It has since inspired us to reflect on our current study habits and look at where we can start changing for the better.Thank you for teaching us about learning how to learn!!
Barbara Oakley shows you how you can go from studying zero to studying hero, and deeply learn complex concepts that you never thought you had a shot at truly knowing. She lays out concrete, easy to follow steps that you can do to help understanding and memory, while also developing skills to fight and eventually eliminate procrastination. I found her inspirational! Thank you Barbara, for creating such an amazing  course!
Great tools and scientific explanations that help us understand how our brain works, why we procrastinate and how to learn more efficiently. You start having a more rational attitude towards your learning process, which helps move forward and get it done easier than before! You can definitely get rid of bad old habits and start creating new more healthy ones. Very helpful for anybody, life is a constant learning journey!
This course introduced many important concepts and tools like "focus mode vs diffuse mode of thinking", "chunking","illusion of competence"..etc. It may be the very basic knowledge about mental function, neurons, and some sort of neuroscience, but it's like a gate opens a new world for you to know your self learning mode and help you in some extend to more focus on the points that needs to be improved. Very great course!
Learning how to learn has never been easier and more fun! This course is an invaluable aid to learn ANYTHING. It provides 'know-how' and confidence in your ability to master any subject matter. The techniques provided to deal with procrastination have significantly impacted my life. I am grateful to Coursera and to instructors Terrence Sejnowsi and especially Barbara Oakley for making learning such a pleasure. Thank you!
The course has provided valuable insights into the cognitive processes of learning.  As a teacher, I agree that all the information given in the course is true to my experience.   This helps me to understand my learners better and to guide them well while dealing with complex topics in their learning. I suggest every parent, child and teacher must aware of this information while dealing with children and their learning.
This is a great course that teaches not only how to learn but how to work and make the best of the energy and time we put into our endeavours. The teacher´s very honest and slow passed approach turns out to be very relaxing and enjoyable, to the contrary of most of the modern high passed youtube videos and tutorials out there. Very recommended for EVERYONE looking to learn about the brain and how to make the best of it.
I loved this course! Full of useful and sound recommendations. Based on real science. I'm planning on applying it to my teaching and to the several subjects I'm constantly learning. I personally don't like the several mentions to zombies and alike, for a couple of times it made me question if the course was for teenagers (I'm 40 yo!). But the information is very well presented and valuable, I would definitely recommend.
This is an amazing course and will help all in their pursuit of higher learning, It teaches techniques that are are both practical and easy to implement such as the focused and diffused modes, the use of metaphors and analogy in learning, the importance of rest and repetition (a little bit every day to learn and grow) achieving mastery in your subject area plus overcoming procrastination with the Pomodoro technique etc.
Barbara is a fun professor to listen to. The jokes and analogies can be terribly cheesy but they are memorable! I wish I had taken this course years before starting univeristy studies. It explains how the brain works to process, learn, and memorize information and gives practical tips anyone can implement when trying to learn new material. This is a valuable course that has already enhanced my learning over the 4 weeks.
I found this course interesting and wish it would have been available when I was in college the first time or even high school. What I enjoyed the most was how learning concepts that I’ve come across through my adult life have been gathered up and organized in easy to follow presentations. I think this material is so important that I’ve asked my teenage daughter entering high school this fall to go through this course.
This was a great course! I followed three years ago, and it is great because it provides not only techniques (this is great!)   to improve your learning process  but, also, the  background/basis for these techniques, and the scientific evidence for this background, as well. This means that it provides you with powerful tools to improve your learning process on your own, (and, in my case, my students' learning process).
It's so helpful for me because now, I can learn how to improve myself and how to learn new skills effectively. This course also help me to recover from my self loath habit (when I failed to make some good result in work). From this course, I learn more about my brain, how to think and learn effectively. I learn so many things and I will recommend many people to take this course. Thank you, Mrs Barbara and Mr Sejnowski.
This course confirm some point of view that I already had and show me new scientific informations and methods  to study, memorize and prepare to tests. The interviews are interesting too because enphasize some concepts and aggregate some particular way to lead with circunstances.  I think this course is useful to everybody and I intend to restart in in some months to check what I retained and learn again what I forgot.
Though I am a master student, I must say this course helps me much in understanding not only how to study but also myself. The strategies to learn in a more effective way are presented clear, concise, and easy to follow and practice. Moreover, there are lots of additional articles that worth the effort of expanding your understanding about learning approaches. This is a must take course for those seeking the knowledge.
Highly recommend this very useful course. Done accelerated learning techniques in the past but as it turns out these can often create ilusions of competence. The scientific validity of the ideas presented make this an extremely valuable course for anyone serious about improving their learning, memorisation and test taking skill as well as making better use of that wonderful miracle of creation we have between our ears.
This is my very first course on Coursera. I benefitted from it tremendously. Really appreciate the teaching, the material and design of the course. I have a lot more to say in details but just don't want to waste your time here. Please go ahead and check it out yourself. I am in my 50s and facing memory loss and shortened focus as few of many other challenges in life. This course is greatly helpful. Happy learning! :-)
I felt this course gave me practical tools to enhance my studying and increase my learning. I purchased the optional book, and found that reading it after completing the lectures helped to solidify the concepts learned during lectures. Barbara and Terry put together an excellent program. I regret I did not have sufficient time to view all the optional videos, but I'm hoping to go back and view them in the coming weeks.
It has been great experience to attend this unique course. A very important topic on which this course is based is going to be helpful to every student. In this course the reasons why some people do not get mastery of subject in spite of spending huge amount of time and energy are elaborately discussed and the techniques to overcome those reasons are also mentioned.I would recommend every student to take this course .
I highly recommend everyone to take this course, you can learn a lot on how your brain works and consequently have a very strong idea on how to learn everything that you want in your life! Barbara is amazing and a really motivating person! I also recommend to watch all the optional interviews because they are made with amazing people that teach you and inspire you a lot... Thank you to the people who made this course!
This course is amazing! It provides a scientifically supported practical toolkit for successful learning. I wish I could learn it before my academic studies because it would definitely make my life easier and my learning experience more effective and relaxed. Fortunately, now I can share it with my children and also use some insights for achieving my career goals and "sharpening the saw". Thanks a lot, Barb and Terry!
This is an excellent course - I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning especially people who believe that they CANNOT learn certain things AFTER a certain age. I am deeply grateful to the two very knowledgeable and learned instructors for the confidence instilled in me for learning newer things effectively. What one learns with pleasure, one never forgets. This course pretty much satisfies that criterion.
This course is a must. It explains a lot of key concepts that prove essential for anyone who wants to be a more efficient learner on any subject.
The various topics are presented in a fun and easy way. And in case you don't get it just rewind the video or look for help on the discussion boards.Another plus are the various interviews with people sharing experiences and difficulties on their specific areas of knowledge.
Brilliant! It may sounds overenthusiastic, but this course enriched my life dramatically. I've got a completely new perspective on how to learn. Even only two weeks after passing the final test and finishing this course I can avouch my learning process has improved up to a new level, both in terms of effectivity and efficiency.Bottom Line: It doesn't matter who you are or what you are specializing in - do this course!
I especially liked the visualization with cartoons and the effort Professor Bloom puts into not only explaining the theories but also showing different perspectives on why they are solid or less solid, applicable or less applicable, and also show the evolution of psychology over time. It made me feel like learning more. Maybe about positive psychology, neuroscience, constructivism or even mental disorders. Let's see!
This is a great course. I recommend it to everyone. It helps us get the right mental tools in our mental toolkit to help learn materials easily, efficiently and with less frustration. It covers techniques to overcome all hindrance in the path of learning like procrastination, the problem in memorizing, the problem in understanding and solving difficult materials. Just GO for this course. It's totally worth the time.
thats the way to learn! im thankfull for your help so much.i think that this is the way to push the human kind forward, by giving people lacking the tools , and option to educate them selves and fulfilling their purpose in life, and by this making their lifes better, the peoples around them lifes better and many more peoples lives better, im Mark rudis, thank you for watching, my comment about learning how to learn.
I've had a magical journey through learning how to learn new things during this course and enjoyed every moment of it! Thank you dear Prof. Oakley for giving me such a great opportunity. First I read your book "A Mind For Numbers." I think Everyone should read it! So interesting and useful. Also thanks a lot Dr. Sejnowski for the precious information about keeping our new neurons alive, via learning and exercise. :)
This course should be taken by everyone on Earth. Everybody can learn something from this course on how to become a more effective learner. It's a shame that a course like this is not mandatory. Dr. Oakley is a PHENOMENAL educator whose teaching style is unparalleled. This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, course that I've ever taken. Do yourself a favor and at least try it because you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Very informative. It covers the main aspects of learning and, best of all it's backed by scientific researches that actually alllow to better understand all your behaviours when talking about learning a new thing. Because that is what they teach you, how to familiarize, learn and master any skill. It's also great for ESL students as the course is presented is a clear manner and with subtitles in different languages.
I was a classroom teacher in the 90s, an early adopter of technology, and I earned my Master of Education in the days of the Arab Spring, when blended learning was emerging as the most effective technology enhanced strategy. All the same, not only did I receive a 21st century, evidence-based upgrade to my knowledge of learning theory, but I witnessed first-hand how to design and deliver a "sticky MOOC." Thanks, L2L!
An excellent course on Learning.  I have enjoyed all the materials introduced here; it's original, well presented and explained clearly.  You can see from the way that they have designed the course that they apply what they preach; for example regular, mini-practice tests placed along the way before the actual quizzes to help us master the material in hand.  And it works as you can feel that you are making progress.
An amazing course which can be seen as a helpful tool to better learning from any subject and from life in general, as a coching session helping you to organise your learning and at the same time your daily work or tasks and a motivational course which makes you understand that (learning) everything is possible. It changed my way to think and to welcome my new tasks or learning sessions with motivation and patience.
I wholeheartedly loved this course! Which I think...says a lot. I feel I got way more out of this course, in terms of applicable life tools, than I even thought when I initially signed up. Understanding what is going on in my brain, throughout the learning process, is a valuable tool that will support me while learning something new! The team who put this course together did a fantastic job! I loved it. Thank you!!!
This course has exceeded my expectations. I learnt very useful tools to improve my learning and have a strong state of mind avoiding learning hindrances.Ms.Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski were great in each lecture due to their domine of the topics and a clear and practical approach of the information  presented.I would recommend this course to everybody who´s welling for learning how to learn based in a scientific backup.
This course changed my perspective about the process of learning.It gave me a deep understanding of how my brain works.It also provided important facts about memory and significant techniques such as the pomodoro and memory palace. Dr Oakely gave some really helpful tips to help overcome your stress during tests and showed how to make the best use of your neural system.I'm really happy that I learned how to learn :)
This course has helped me immensely in terms of understanding how the mind works and how to use highly effective techniques to help in learning. I have also been able to remove procrastination from my daily tasks which was a hindrance to progress in learning and lifestyle. I feel more confident in my skills and abilities and look forward to learning more things and enjoy the process of learning. Highly recommended.
This course was beneficial and helped me as I work on the second part of my career, which will require intense learning of new skill sets and the ability to tackle my procrastination habit.This course was beneficial with tips and providing an understanding of why we do the things we do — dating back to habits formed in early school days. Thank you for the clarity and confidence now to chase my future career dreams.
Really useful, it is great to get some insights into how our brains work when we study. Some of the stuff seems obvious, but I found that I did not really understand why things work or do not work. Now I do and it is interesting, I have found myself being able to actually give advice to people studying, which is something I would have been reluctant to try before the course! I recommend this course, please take it.
Marked increase in both productivity and ability to learn effectively after the first two weeks of this course. Given easy to implement ways to learn and focus more readily - useful for study as well as general productivity (any task that requires time and focus - could be a skill or project). Extremely helpful, will likely annoy all my friends and family by constantly sharing what I've learned. Highly recommended!
Thank you so much! LhtL is an excellent course. It changed the way I study and learn, and the way I think about studying and learning. Not only did it provide new information (I suppose most of us students knew a lot of the things taught, such as "you should study the material during a longer period of time - not just the last night"), but it helps in actually implementing those things in every day life. Thank you!
Recommended for everyone. As a retiree, a lifetime learner, and graduate school drop out I have done a lot of learning. Some, like the incidental learning that happens when surfing Wikipedia, has been pleasant. Some, especially in an academic or work setting has been painfully frustrating. This course has been very helpful in showing me how to make learning pleasant and effective as opposed to hard and frustrating.
I am very happy that I completed this module! There are few teachers who taught about how to learn and how our brain is actually doing while we are learning new stuff. By knowing more about the activities happening in the brain helps me to control my learning, and sometime, use some tricks to convince my brain go deeper, or to train my brain.I can't wait to apply the methods taught in this module on other subjects!
This is a very awesome course! I studied hard and got high grades when I was in college but found myself struggling to recall the concepts or apply them in the real world. Now that I am trying to un-learn and re-learn, I have found the lessons here particularly useful not just because of the tips but also from the realizations of the mistakes that I did in the past. Kudos to everyone who made this course possible!
I've never been happier after taking a course as I am now.. this short course is one of the best things anyone can get out of a MOOC plus it gives you tricks that are helpful to people in every stage of their life. inspirational interviews with experts in different fields and timely quizzes embed the information into your brain. I recommend this to all especially students who are thinking of taking courses online.
I have always struggled with retaining information and focusing. Learning How to Learn has given me priceless tools and resources to use to improve my studying skills and help me remember the information. This course is invaluable and I highly recommend to everyone. Even if you don't have trouble learning or studying, you will still acquire useful skills that you can apply to your everyday life, work and personal.
I just finished this course and I feel this knowledge should be mandatorily taught in schools to help students learn more efficiently. After all, students spend a lot of years studying every day. Making this extensive process more efficient, by use of such courses, would save a lot of time and energy, and produce better results.I genuinely think this can make a significant difference for a lot of people out there.
This course was one of the best things I have done for myself because of the amount of great information, techniques and approaches given to me. It was also fascinating to learn about the different parts of the brain, neurons, and our body works in correlation to learning and understanding. I would definitely recommend everyone and anyone to take this course and no doubt it will benefit you in some way or another.
So I just finished the
course  and
I can say that it has actually changed the way I perceive my studies. I
strongly recommend it to anyone willing to put some efforts to change the way
you learn.If you are like me, and you got
tired of all the click-bait rubbish that surrounds the productivity articles
and advices you will find on the internet, then this is the course for you, and
it is the last course you need.
This is an exceptional course for a young or old learner especially a life long learner. As a health care professional,  I wish I had taken this course before any of my formal education, but it was still incredibly helpful in breaking my procrastination habit and in learning how to be more effective in my learning and time management. Barbara Oakley is an absolute delight to learn from. her passion is infectious
Excellent. Simply excellent. This course has opened a whole new world for me. Thank you very much to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for their superb lectures, and for all the effort they have put into making this course. I'm already applying the new mindset and techniques I've learned in this course when approaching something new in my studies, and it's yielding great results. Thank you very much!
I had a great time with this course! It is an interesting subject, they explain in easy ways and overall, this is quite important through life (knowing how to learn can do many good things to you, and save many time!) Also, it's noticeable the love and passion they have put in this course, and they really care and try to pass many important aspects of good habits, some philosophy and even a little neuroscience.
Every video is well explained and having lots of scientific research to guideline us in Learning How to Learn. From understanding how does our brain works, to realize the cue of falling into the trap of procrastination, how to improve our memory and various tips to excel in the test. This course certainly helps students and adults to gain the confidence to encounter the subject which might seems tough for them.
It's such a pleasing course. It's like a good friend, to whom you can come and chill out, relax. Literally, every chunk of information will be useful, tests only help you to remember better and moreover it's explained why! You won't be immersed deeply in dark shadows of scientific terms. You will know the basics. Besides, if you are interested in, you have access to different resources with interesting articles
This course is fantastic, it gave me a great new perspective on the learning. What you learn is applicable in so many aspects of your life. Both professor Sejnowski and professor Oakley motivated me to keep learning and be more confident to start with new areas of my interest. And most importantly, to start spreading this newly acquired knowledge to others. Thank you both for this opportunity to learn from you.
I would like to thank all the staff in this course for providing assistance to the education of young people with low financial capabilities. I have enjoyed learning this course very much. I would like to thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for their efforts in delivering the content in the simplest ways and also all the guests who were hosted in the course and to benefit from their experiences.
Best Course you can take if you are interested in not just learning new things but also learning about yourself. This course explains clearly how you learn a new skill and what techniques and methods you can follow to make yourself a better learner. This is one of those unique courses for students in any field, of any age group which helps you understand your learning ability. Barbara and Terry are Great Gurus.
This is the best course that I've ever done! All content is grounded by scientific principles, which ensures the accuracy of the information.The way the topic is approached is quite clear and direct, and it is easy to understand. All tips given by Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence are easy to be introduced into the routine, making this course extremely recommended for those who really want to learn more efficiently.
Half way through the course I have already learned so much about learning. It's a combination with practical learning skills and theories on neural science. Instructor is super knowledgeable and she explains concepts very clearly, and more often than not, full of fun. I highly recommend this course to whoever still wants to learn new things in life, whatever the subject/ skill/ sport might be. Happy learning :)
The course practices what it preaches using several short video lectures that are cheesy in many ways, but memorable nonetheless. Tests feel like a recall tool used to further learning rather than some sort of unsurmountable challenge.  Overall, because of the wisely broken down lecture clips, the quality of the material given, and the practicality and applicability to almost anyone, I gave this course 5 stars.
Before, I have not thought about learning from the point of view in the course, people around us usually demand good results and hope us to do our bests during life. We usually try to learn materials, languages, arts, or even sports, but we often forget that learning itself is something we need to learn in order to give our bests at any approach.It was a great course to start with, I recommend it for everyone.
I really enjoyed this class and wish they had other classes available and some sort of work book to practice techniques and chunking. If I would have learned this in grade school or college I would have attained and retained so much more along my education journey. A journey that should never end. One other thing, I would have attempted to attack some subjects that scared me if I had these tools in my arsenal.
It's a must before diving into other courses training or practice.It helps you to have an effective way of absorbing new informations which speeds up your learning.It is good for all ages who wants change,in general.It is a sort of a lobby before you start stepping at new doors of exploration or opportunities. It is like the golden rule in learning,and these rules are the few ones that isn't meant to be broken
I am a data analyst by trade and every day, I need to learn new things in my career. I struggled with the motivation and consistency to adapt to new technologies, ideas or way of working in the past. This course gives a great understanding and practical know-how of getting back to learning mode at will :)I am really thankful for the staff and teachers for their effort and my classmates for their participation.
This is one of the best courses out there, period. The science of how to learn more effectively has progress a lot and this is the best resource I've found so far that covers the most important concepts and explains them with humor and charm. Dr. Barbara Oakley is now one of the biggest influences in my life and I'll be forever indebted to her. I wish both of the instructors great success in the coming years.
An unbelievably valuable course that every single person (yes, I mean all 7.5 billion) should take as soon as is humanly possible! This will help my professional studies massively. More significantly though, it is already having a very positive impact on my personal life because I understand myself, and others, so much better. My sincere and genuine thanks - you should be 'knighted' as we say here in England!
Excellent course that I wish was available when I was a teenager, it might have saved me from dropping out of high school, hence lessen the struggles to build a professional career with which I could support myself. Now, close to my sixties, I decided I want to learn new skills and pursue a new career, I believe "Learning How To Learn" has taught me crucial tools and strategies to help me accomplish my goals.
This class is invaluable for learning about the process of learning rather than the product of learning. It provides some valuable information on how your brain works and how to get the most out of your study time. I especially found the section on procrastination useful.Highly recommended if you're looking for information on how to learn well, enhance your knowledge and make efficient use of your study time.
This course is fantastic. It shows you how your brain works and what are the most helpful strategies for learning. For someone like me, who is always enrolling in new classes, attending courses online and thinking about getting a new degree, this course teaches how to use your energy and commit in ways that not deplete your energy and really help you accomplish your goals. I wish this was taught in school...!
The course is absolutely fantastic. The instructors, especially Miss Oakley with her calm and confident demeanor, makes learning absolutely a joy ride. All the tips and techniques, new insights into the working of brain, superb metaphors and analogies makes the course one of the best courses which i had till date taken in Coursera. Don't have second thoughts and click "Enroll Now". You'll not regret doing so.
I think it should be called Learning How to Learn Better. Nevertheless, it is an amazing course - it helped me understand a lot of things that I intuitively knew as a teacher and a student. It also gives helpful techniques to tackle procrastination - something I am afflicted with from time to time. I also like the fact that the team keeps sending me links on learning or research on the same.Thank you so much!
I've absolute loved this course! It feels like a discovery of a new world. I thought I am opening the door to the learning techniques, but the truth is I've found this wonderful new world, that just sucked me in. And now I can't stop learning more and wanting to learn even more. I'm very grateful to the most wonderful instructors ever who shared their insights with us. Thank you, Dr Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
I would highly recommend this course to everyone! An absolute must for all educators and learners. As an educator myself, I have come away with a sack of ideas that I know are going to enhance my teaching forever, needless to say my learning too. I honestly, see teaching and learning with a different perspective now. Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski, truly THANK YOU for teaching me about learning.
Excellent ! This is what I've been waiting for, since my high school years ! I was telling my 17 year old son, Boris, just the other day, this month, that we should've been taught how to learn, before being sent off to school ! Or at least gradually taught how to learn ... I remember one person told me, during my quest, that: ..."you learn how  to learn by yourself, as you advance in your studies..." Wrong !
This course is as valuable as Enlightenment. Sheer genius is Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrance Sejnowski and "Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects" course team. 
I would recommend everyone to do this revolutionary course. I strongly believe that this course must be part of the regular school curriculums throughout the world.Best Regards and Thanks,Varun Sharma.
India.
Really excellent course that I wish I had taken 20+ years ago but am at least grateful that I ran across now. Everyone can benefit from this course, but those who've struggled with school or a particular topic will benefit the most. To obtain the most benefit from this course, get the accompanying text book (I got the kindle version) and also review the additional readings and videos at the end of each week.
Great lesson structure, great teaching group, all in all an awesome course! This is actually my first ever online course, this course has been worth every second. "Learning how to learn"has given me new and profound perspective towards learning, I only wish I had started this course four years earlier, it would have made all the difference. I recommend everyone to take this course, it has offered me so much.
I enjoyed the course and it is very easy to take the information on board, you don't need a background in teaching to understand it. Delivered well in short chunks with short quiz's on the way to help you digest and remember what you have learnt.It doesn't take a large commitment in terms of time to complete the course so click 'yes' and join up.This is the 1st mooc I've done and look forward to doing more.
Loved learning new facts about brain and how it taken in new information. had some prior experience with diffused thinking and aha moments, but had no idea on what may make it happen. Exercise being so important for learning was an eye opener. its going to be part of my daily schedule to have some form of exercise.Thank You Very much for such a wonderful experience and loads of learning about how to learn!!
Oustanding course that will provide a fantastic set of tools to improve your learning skills in a effective and fun way through a very interesting journey into neuroscience. I'd highly reccomend the course whether your are at high school or Phd student. It can be used for parents wiling to help their kids as well. It's a course based on what is the most modern research in neuroscience and learning process.
The skills taught in this class are magnificent. However, it is the small one line sentences, the advice, the feeling that others are also in the same boat, that really encouraged me to continue. I like this class not just because it taught me valuable skills to apply to my learning, but also to realize that perseverance and determination are really the key to success. This course reminded me of just that.
I'm grateful that I have bumped into this course. The ideas delivered are life changing. So little attention is paid to HOW WE LEARN, though we love to celebrate the good students and chastise the 'bad' ones. This set of ideas which could be described as a primer in neuroscience, and a set of techniques that make you learn more efficiently and joyfully, SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. What are we waiting for?
Very interesting subject matter presented in a memorable way. The course was really helpful in understanding how to retain information and be more deliberate about learning. It also provided good tips for combatting procrastination, not tricking myself into thinking I am learning, and not getting "stuck" in the same old ways of thinking. The professors are quirky, but it works well with the subject matter.
This course has really helped me not about learning how to learn but also how to deal with procrastination and to use the diffuse mode of thinking in solving problems in other areas of my life. A brilliant course indeed.  Although not compulsory, the book by Barbara Oakley called A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra) is a good companion material for this course.
I like this course so much and Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley are super awesome. I appreciate it so much. I really enjoy studying this course. It does help me a lot to learn how to learn effectively, efficiently and in a positive way. I highly recommend this course to other friends who are seeking a better way of learning or encountering any difficulty in learning. Good work and Thank you very much
I enjoyed this course. It was well paced and the material was repeated just often enough to sink in, but not so often that it became dull. I like that the course designers supported assertions about learning techniques with modern neuro-biology research and am still reading the references. It was short enough that it was easy to complete, but "full" enough that I felt there was value in taking the course.
Recommended for anyone looking forward to improvise in any aspect, it's the most basic thing that everyone must be aware of. Personally, it made me realize the flaws in learning methods/habits ,that were committed, me not being aware of 'em all the time! In simpler terms, some things are realized only when someone else points them out for ya, it's amazing how 'science' could do all of it! Love Science(+1)
Hello, I liked it very much. I didn´t pay for the certificate because when I took Positive psychology I paid and NEVER recieve the certificate. I tried to communicate and there is no telephone nor contact to claim. I checked on the web and several people had gone through the same thing so im never paying again. Maybe you could help to improve this with coursera. Nevertheless I loved your course. thankyou.
A well designed course. Happy to be part of this team and learning How to Learn. Professor makes us easy to sail through the topic at the same time your interest for the course increases over time. Even though test questions seems easy, the assignments will make you work a bit to get most out of the course. I recommend this course to everyone and would rate the highest point available in the rating scale.
This course was just WOW. So many people struggle with the things explained in here. I really loved this course because it explains why the things work but it also gives you solutions.Abraham Lincoln said: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." Here, you invest 10-20 hours on this course, that will make you life so much easier for the rest of your life.
This course is essential for every one either still learning or working in the field of education and teaching. It is very well organised covering essential topics and the instructors are more than awesome simplifying the material and years of experience are reflected on the conveyed subject. I have finished it once but consider it as a golden reference to solve a problem of learning and education around.
I have found this course very clear and motivational.  It is a good introductory course. Nevertheless I  was expecting exercises to apply and test the suggested techniques, especially techniques such as the mental palace. I have found very interesting the impostor syndrome, maybe because I was/am affected by that. It is very important to speak about it, so that it is easier for people to "heal" from that.
A practical yet enjoyable course! I am slowly but surely feeling the benefits of applying the techniques I learned from this course. The material was presented in a convincing way, and the instructors came across as encouraging and empathetic. The lessons are fairly compact and too-the-point too, so I'm glad I spent just a couple of weeks to make myself more effective for the rest of my learning journey!
Actually, I have some small concerns that the quizzes were so obvious that i didn't need to read the full choices to answer.. and it did workAlso, Barbra has intentionally tried to emphasize on the part that the passion always change.. OK but it is also a key for success to many.Revealing that the topics that the course is about is not the absolute right and it may not work would make me much comfortable
Approachable, practical and relevant to all stages of life.  Should be highly recommended or even essential for when at school.  I wish this had been available when I was going to University! But appreciate it is available now.  If you want to learn how to improve your own understanding and approach to the life long adventure of learning, or even if you just want to improve your results, try this course.
Learning How to Learn is a great course. It's presented in a manner that allowed me to quickly grasp many new concepts and ideas which isn't usually the case for me. Dr. Barbara Oakley and her colleagues are brilliant and I really enjoyed this course. In fact I share much of the information I learned here with my daughter and work mates on an ongoing basis. There is something here for everyone.Thank you!
It has been a real privilege to be part of this course. Learning how to learn may sound simple but Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the team behind this course have shared a lot of essential knowledge and science behind the proces of learning.I am a lot wiser now and I have so many take-aways that I can support my son a lot better than before. It will make learning much more interesting from now on...
This course has helped me a lot. It has already changed how I face, not only my studies, but my life and my relationships. It has provided me with amazing new ideas and tools, and even the ones that I already knew, it has put to work in a very effective way. Thank you very much, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. I really hope to be able to meet you in person, so that I can properly thank you. My best wishes.
I really enjoyed taking part in this course.The fully "Open" nature of the course enhanced the effectiveness of the course.This course, has reinforced for me, the truism that you are never too old learn. It discredited the other truism that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. At least not when I was the "old dog".Should you take my recommendation, it is my wish for you to take away as much as I have.
I thoroughly enjoyed the course.  I was disappointed that there was not more participation in the forums from other classmates.  I found Dr. Oakley's methods of teaching very creative and assisting in the learning process.  The testing did indeed help my learning as it showed where I was wrong and gave me the opportunity to correct it.   The outside reading was also helpful in understanding the material.
Highly recommended course!Barbara reveals the power of knowledge tools in such an easy manner! Somehow it simply grows and yields it's fruits in your mind.Moreover a whole new world of knowledge and interesting people got unveiled.Thank you Barbara and Professor Terrjanowski so much!Also I would recommend Barbara's book "A mind for numbers", which is a great aid for this course to solidify the concepts.
It doesn't just teach techniques on effective learning but also explains how our mind works and how we process information. through this, we can understand ourselves and can think of which is more effective to us. It highlights things that we should avoid and the benefits of things that =can help to improve our mind. Understanding how our mind works gives confidence and takes our envy away fro geniuses.
It is fantastic course, I've had lot of fun learning about learning and how to learn. And furthermore I've learnt a lot about my mind, now I have tools to tackle my procrastination problems. This course doesn't require much time, but it can give you many powerful tools and knowledge of various techniques. And it's only up to you if you make use of them. I strongly recommend taking this course. Cheers :)
I found the course to be interesting and potentially useful.  The instructors were knowledgeable, dynamic and witty keeping my attention throughout. The quizzes were applicable and kept within context of the module material. This was my first course with Coursera so I used it as a "test" course and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be moving on to other courses of interest. I highly recommend this course.
The course was amazing! It's very useful for anyone. Awesome! I wish I should have learned about this long time before. Both professors are knowledgeable and energetic. The way of teaching is motivated, uplifting, and enjoyable, encouraging me to continue each session to the end without sleeping. The staff who are in charge of answering questions in discussion forum are not helpful and not informative.
This is a very interesting and important course for anyone who is trying to learn absolutely ANYTHING. As Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski guide you through the different techniques and important inputs on brain functioning, they will turn the spotlights of your thought processes into better understanding and interpreting the "mechanics" of your most important tool for learning, your mind.
Many helpful tips, suggestions, and ways of looking at how we learn so that we may learn more fully and more quickly. I would happily recommend this course (and Dr. Oakley's book) to anyone looking to improve their time management, creativity, organization, and learning skills. Might not always be the most entertaining video you'll see all day but it is fascinating and easily understood, nonetheless. T
White I've encountered bit's and pieces of the material and ideas discussed in this course, this just speaks to the fact that they are actually work, they were just that bits and pieces. This course organizes it into one place, all the while actively demonstrating and incorporating the material it teaches. If you're like me and need structure to really make sense of things, this is the course for you.
I completely recommend this course. It gave me a
clear view of the work organization and learning strategies. You do not need to
think about maths or science for taking advantage of it. The different
strategies to cope with procrastination and frustration are highly useful for
your life. Both professors explain in “friendly” way and complex
neuroscientific concepts become metaphors and funny concepts.
Hello, I'm from Russia. I almost finished this wonderful course. My English is bad. But thanks to the subtitles, I was able to understand everything. This course has opened up a lot of new information for me. He helped to find different methods and techniques that I needed, which allowed me to improve my ability to learn, develop and improve. I apologize for such an English is all Google translator =)
This is an incredible course. I think that every person should take it and I wonder actually why teachers in schools and universities don't pay attention much about HOW to learn. I'm so happy I met this course and I'm sure I will be revisiting it again from time to time. Barbara's example about her own engineering experience is especially inspiring for me, she gave me the belief in myself. Thanks!!!!!
This is a very useful Course that Illustrates the Basic steps in the learning process and give you a useful methods and tools to use through your learning to maximize your memorizing and understanding to retain the information in easily wayand also tell you how to prepare for tests and even how to answer the question in the testThis  course will help any  student or any one who try to learn new things
This course is revealing very important facts about learning and presents a few very good tricks how to more easily and effectively learn new things. During this course, I realised that there is basically no such thing as excuses like you don't have talent for something or you're not smart enough. All you need to do is to get involved, stay open-minded for new ideas, and enjoy the process of learning.
I wish this class was available when I was in high school many years ago. I had no confidence in my intellectual abilities. Teaching in the 60s and 70s was so 'cookie cutter' - the expectation was that everyone learned the same way. As an adult learner I realized that it took me a bit longer to take in the information and practiced many of the techniques taught through this class. I like the way both
If someone studied a lot during school and university, they might figure out a few of the techniques presented in this course. Instead of years, with a few days of extra study, you'll learn all the essential and useful tips and tricks to make your study session a lot more efficient and enjoyable.In my opinion, this should be taught at least in every university and high school for first-year students.
What a shame this course is already over. I absolutely enjoyed it and will miss Barb and Terry with their kind and comforting voice to talk to me during the lonely Covid-19 lockdown period. I strongly recommend this course for any MOOC newbie like me. It is so interesting and lots of fun. I feel well prepared having useful tools on hand to conquer the Coursera world now and absolve many more courses.
I am very grateful and thankful to everyone involved in making this course available and in such a high quality and in such a pleasant way to learn. I absolutely loved this course and I learned a lot. It definitely opens a new chapter in my learning journey. Im gonna miss Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence S., they were very professional and amazing teachers!!!Thank you!My very Best,Juliana Bacellar
This was the best online course I have taken (not one of the best, but the best). It teaches you skills that you can transfer on to future learning in any area, and offers practical tips on how to tackle procrastination, improve your own learning abilities and more. I am so grateful to coursera and the creators of the course. This was such a fun learning experience and makes me excited to learn more!
I urge all those who need to learn because they have to, or because they love it, to enrol in this course this very instant. There's nothing like knowing how your brain works when you're learning. This is actually the first MOOC everybody should study before enrolling in any other course. Thanks to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for offering it, and Coursera to launch it. And happy learning to you all!
This is a fantastic course. Probably the best course I've taken on Coursera and other platforms for that matter. What makes it great is that it's really well paced, there's not an abundance of overwhelming information and the fact that it uses some of the techniques recommended in the course, like spaced repetition where some concepts are repeated several times during the course. Truly amazing stuff.
I appreciate you time and effort to make this course available. Before this course, I thought I was developing the right method for learning, but I was having several mistakes. This course has helped me to understand how the learning process works and how I can sharpen my study technique. I used to think that reading 15 books a year was a good record for me, but I was wasting my time fooling myself.
Insightful, actionable, straightforward, easy-to-digest information, skills, and tips to help you become a better learner. Course material is applicable to nearly every aspect of everyday life - from fighting procrastination and creating better habits, to understanding the way attention, memory, and the brain work, Barbara and Terry present everything in a matter-of-fact, fun manner. Well worth it!!
Engaging, valuable, and insightful. Don't be dissuaded by the simplicity of how it's taught, the techniques and scientific understanding beneath them, are highly beneficial in such a practical way.  It was delightful to learn from both Prof. Barbara Oakley and Prof. Terrence Sejnowski. They're warm-hearted teachers and genuinely interested in developing your quality of learning, and ultimately life.
It is a wonderful course, I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to learn something new, or even acquiring new techniques to assist him in his or her current studies.Many thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley, a great professor who has the academic ability to convey information smoothly in an easy understandable way. Many thanks to Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, whom I gained new scientific knowledge from.
Wish I had discovered a course like this much earlier in my academic career. I'm an adult educator and feel this course has MUST know elements for all students! I would especially like to see my more challenged students take it; I think they would be surprised how following even a few of the outlined techniques would enhance their success and satisfaction with their learning experiences. Well done!!
This is a course that not only teaches you tools to study better but also to keep yourself motivated throughout your learning journey. When you get stuck in the middle or even in the beginning it becomes insistently difficult to carry on. With the help of this course one can really understand how not to give up and keep going on. I think that would be the greatest take away for me from this course.
I already know most of the stuff here like Pomodoro technique, group meaning or Memory Palace, because I was already using them. However I was very interested in the neurological aspects of learning. Due to the fact that I l know most of the stuff here, it just took me 1 week to finish the whole course. I recommend to anyone who wants to be a better, more efficient learner. It can change your life.
Amazing! I'd be so much further if schools would require this course early on in education. Incourperating lessons from this course in early education or even as a whole would be benificial in standardized testing and students progression in overall learning. I loved this course now I'm looking foward to learning so much more. Thank you and everyone who made this course available to people like me.
I just don't understand why this is not teached in school. Some of this you might have figured out but this course will enable you to plan in a systematic way how you study and remember what you study. Very insightful on the study proccess. I am glad this is the first course I took on Coursera, it will help me so much with the other courses I intend to attend.Thanks again for providing this course!
That was my first online course and i have really enjoyed so much and gained a lot of precious ideas and concepts about different aspects of learning, My professor has shared it with my classmates and me, and i knew it won't be such a waste of time, I want to thank so much everyone who has contributed by any kind of help to create this course, especially Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski.
This course changed my life, the way I see the world, the way I learn, how I understand, how I memorize. it is a didactic course, simple to understand, all the readings were interesting, all the guests were incredible and the teachers Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski teach very well, they are very charismatic. The experience I had was unique and I will take it for the rest of my life.
I really enjoy learning about this material. it's not only help in study but also into my life. I learn a lot of things that i didn't realize before that i could do better and thinking widely. Dr.Barbara & Dr.Terrace gave an easy, clear and simple explanation for each topic. So in the end we could understand and apply it in our daily life.  Thank you for open up my perspective to learn and my life
I found this really helpful for myself and have been sharing what I'm learning with my teens. So much of this I have had to learn the hard way by trial and error, we really should know how our brains work to gather and store information in a useful way. This course addresses that. There are so many supportive resources added in that I have a wealth of study information to turn to. Thank you, team.
This is a masterpiece of how to learn to learn. There isn't any other way to boost one's intelligence  rather than thinking of it. Our brain is a powerful machine which needs reprogramming over and over by learning new things, practicing  them will keep our long-term memory healthy. Finally, this course proves that you can regulate your own learning and be self-confident on everything you ship on.
Excellent course.  I highly recommend this to help further your understanding of learning.  By the end of the course, you will look at thinking differently and question your thought processes in the future.  Specifically, they do focus on test taking at the end of the course, although this was a quick topic compared to the rest of the in-depth review of learning throughout the rest of the program.
One of the best courses I've ever taken in coursera!! ♥The content is very applicable and easy to understand because the professor is EXCELLENT. I believe every student should take this course at least once. It did help me a lot and I am very excited to apply all the techniques on my own studies.I am very greatful for you guys to have shared all this great information with me. Thank you so much :)
I encourage everyone to attend this course! The Professors do a wonderful job at explaining how neural networks and the brain's structure relate to techniques that we utilise in studying. You come across new techniques and perhaps a few we've known of before, but the difference lies in understanding why they or they don't don't work, which makes it convenient as a learner to improve how we study.
As a newly graduated student  from college, I wished I learned these concepts and techniques when I was a freshman. It made me think that, learning how to learn, could have potentially helped me aced exams before when I was still a student. Alas, my time has passed, I recommend these to all future students who wished to feel that the education system is too focused on the product not the process.
I found learning how to learn a very helpful course for improving your learning and how to learn with effective techniques to strengthen your knowledge and expertise in what you are studying or learning. it is like a instruction manual to how to learn. with very kind and helpful instructors who simplify  complicated  terms and concepts about human brain in a way everyone can grasp and understand.
The instructor is very calm, active, accurate and put some related interviews in some videos  in a very thoughtful way. All the time I come back for some reminding, found this course very motivated and helpful. As I love to learn new things, this course has pointed to the majority of knowledge we would have to know to be more successful in our education time.  Hope you enjoy and welcome to learn!
I enjoyed Learning How To Learn as it provides a lot of useful insights on learning. These insights help me to be a better learner and a better teacher - as the last part of the course suggests that we should teach others about these techniques then we can confidently say that we have achieved full mastery. In so doing, we are also enriched by the learning and answers that our "students" give us.
refreshing to learn..how i can maximise my learning journey. its  been eye opening, inspiring and evoking the spirt of learning  and charting new areas of knowledge. i highly reccomend this course to anyone struggling with their studies and thos ethat seek to seppen how to learn anything in lifethank you Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team for putting out these course
When I told my wife the title of the course she immediately did a double take, scoffed, and checked my face to see if I was joking.  Learning how to learn seems like a counter-productive skill to master, but it all makes PERFECT sense.  If you want to learn more, you should master the ART of learning so you can actually LEARN more.This course is awesome and I could not recommend it highly enough!
This course is awesome, I considered myself to be a good student, and during this course I learnt that I was a good student because I had discovered various techniques that are taught in this course, I didn't know I knew them and that they were the responsibles for my good grades. I also discovered new techniques that I didn't know, and with them I can now become an excellent student and learner.
Excellent course, both accessible and precise explanations of the psychology and neurology of learning, from very visual explanations at first to very detailed explanations later, with many concrete advice and examples of how to spend your learning time more efficiently, and many ressources to dig further into the recent underlying research papers. Should be taught mandatorily in all highschools.
This
course proved to be extremely valuable and insightful.  Some ideas I had been practicing since ever
(without being aware), but most of techniques and knowledge were new to
me.  Looking in retrospect, they make
total sense, since they fit in many life experiences, actually explaining some
outcomes (good and bad) that I had previously experienced over the years.
Highly recommend this course !
This course inspired me to take a more serious approach to my education. Now I know how to gain not just an understanding of given information, but knowledge and mastery of the material. I know how to remember something long-term, how to gain more skills by studying less, how to battle procrastination, how to handle stress and perform well on tests. Quite a useful course anyone can benefit from.
This course is excellent! Dynamic yet focused. It teaches what it preaches without you even noticing. The supporting material suggested is wonderful, very carefully chosen articles, and the interviews contribute widely to better understand the couse contentent. It was a real pleasure to take it. I do hope to find again Dr. Oakley and Dr. Senjwoski, wonderful instructors.  Thank you both so much!
This course has changed my life, not only in studying and learning, but setting goals. Barbara and Terrence are very helpful at helping us learn, and even use the methods they teach, to teach to us. I feel proud because this is the first formal qualification I have ever achieved, and I feel as if I can approach any study, academic or industry, and even informally. Thank you to everyone involved.
I watched this course with open mouth. Great techniques that can drastically improve my learning ability. I eager to integrate this techniques into my learning routine. I've just implemented only Pomodoro technique, and it is so helpful and enable me to study more hours with better concentration. Thank You! It is a great course that I will never forget. Brilliant tutor and marvelous information!
I really learn a lot through this videos. I had try to make myself a better learners right now and to go further on my interest of study. The way of thinking of process not a product really change my mind of learning something about quantity that I need to have but actually is based on what quality you have learn from something. Thanks for all the lecturers and the supported team on this course.
Since the moment I selected this course I knew I needed it, I just hoped it was good. I wasn't disappointed. Learning How to Learn is a powerful tool which I will use a lot since I've been struggling for a while in my studies. I strongly recommend it if you feel like your studies aren't giving you the results you'd hope and in a sense you know you could do better, but you don't know how. 10/10.
This Course taught by Miss Barbara Oakley had a deep and enriching impact on my personality and attitude towards learning. I am writing this review after almost 2 years after I did the course and I still remember and aplly the study hacks and tools i learnt through this course. I personally feel that this course should be made compulsory to all students irrespective of their educational stream.
Thanks for Teaching How To Learn, This is one of the best courses I've taken ever and it has changed the way I learn and remember things and setting goal habits and tackling procrastination. Thank you for all the learning from this course videos, blog posts, book material, research papers which are the backbone of the underlying course and the Mind for Numbers book which I will be soon reading.
Interesting and helpful. Both professors are very positive and optimistic which is very encouraging. The course gives a lot of great techniques and tricks on how to study more effectively while also giving some elementary information on how the brain and memory work which is also interesting. I gladly recommend this course for anyone, especially college students who have problems with studying.
The most phenomenal course I’ve taken. Taught me that we learn “learning” differently at each stage of our lives. I toke this course twice and the first time it was in my mid-50s taiko it again at late 50s and learned even more. I only wish that what I know now I knew in my  20’s a30’s. But alas, don’t we all. I applaud all the professors and please know that I will continue coming back to it.
Incredible course. It opened my mind to a lot of many things. The knowledge and technics gained in this course are worth taking for life. Knowing how your brain works and more specifically how it learns made me understand a lot of things and made me change how i thought or was taught to do it. I hope now to learn a lot of new things and destroy my mentality of "hating to learn" made by school.
This is a hands-on (or brains-on) course that introduces ideas and techniques that are applicable to daily life, be it studying or work. The Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of timed and focused work) has helped me develop better study habits, and the concepts of interleaving and diffused thinking have helped me take a new approach to studying and figuring out solutions for my professional life.
This is a great course! I really appreciate having stumbled across it in a blog post online. It has taught me a better understanding of myself and how I might better apply myself in my learning to compliment and expand my career and personal life. Yes, the videos are a bit corny at times, but they're memorable (ha!). I really appreciated how Dr. Oakley approached the topics and discussed them.
amazing course offerd by yale university. we must try this courses.well, we learn many thing from our day to day life and experience , this course give me lots of new fundamental hints for my life lesson.in this course chunkig, using mode of brain and memories ,make schedule for routine, control of thoughts are very use full.i think i give my time to this particuller course is frutfullin this
It was indeed a very helpful course. I was able to understand the little intricacies behind the entire process of learning in a short span of time. The course provided so many amazing techniques and the necessary confidence that I required to pursue new and amazing things happening around the world. The instructors have, actually, sharpened my mind, without ever knowing me. Thank you to them.
This course is awesome. I have learn a lot about how to bring the most out of my brain and understand how my brain really work in term of learning. After you've learned this course, I promise that your study method will improve and you will get many technique for studying also can adapt into your working.Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this such a wonderful course.
This course is really awesome. It helped me understand how my brain works and this will be very beneficial to me. I've learned some techniques and put them into action and the results were really perfect. Thanks want be enough for what I've learned, actually, this might be a turning point in my whole life. So, thanks for every single person who participated in providing us with this course. ♥
This course covers the physical and psychological aspects of learning (i.e., how you feel when procrastinating, and what chemicals affect which parts of learning). I liked that it did not try to fit everyone into a mould, but still gave tips on the most effective ways a person learns. The instructors are quite nice and the lectures are very short which makes it easy to take in smaller chunks.
This course presents a very nice overview of how the mind works in relation to learning and why some studying techniques are more effective than others as a consequence.The content can feel a little bit shallow at times but is presented in a very engaging way and with lots of pointers for people who want to deepen the knowledge of a particular aspect.All in all I highly recommend this course!
This course is very much effective and helpful for students and other people too. This course have made learning easy and more interesting. This course have many effective and useful tricks which will help you in studying infact help you in studying more effectively. This will help you in improving your grades and learning skills. You can grasp topics easily and improve yourself in studying.
Exciting even when you already know about some of the concepts and techniques. The Videos focus on the key concepts in a fun an memorable way, the additional material was always helpful and the repetition (in the videos and the exams) maximized the outcome. The one thing I wished would be an update of the "further reading" section (all the articles and papers have been published around 2014)
I have learnt (and am still learning) so many helpful techniques in this course. More importantly, I understand why they are important. I have made so many of the common learning mistakes they describe but feel confident I can overcome them for present and future learning. Barbara and Terrence are fabulous facilitators. Wonderful course. Highly recommended to anyone at any stage of learning.
Superb content. Presented well and easy to follow. At first, I thought the production was low quality and lacking. Then, in the Mindshift course, I went into Barb's basement and found out that this was all DIY and she learned how to do video editing just for the course. Sometimes it is not how fancy something looks, but how useful the content is and the material presented here is essential!
This course was really great!!! It helped me a lot to study in a better way for my exams, I learned a lot of new techniques to be a better student and it was no complex at all, it was really easy for someone who isn't an English native speaker who knows nothing about the brain, so in conclusion I would really recommend this course for someone who is interested in becoming a better learner!
This course is amazing, i got so much than i expected from the course. it is as applicable to life as it applicable to studies in school. while taking the course i read some books and materials recommended by the course, you can say i practiced my own "interleaving" but it has really changed my life. It is definitely the best course i took this year. Thanks Barbara Oakley and Dr Sejnowski.
As a student still in university, I wished I would've taken this course before I graduated in high school. I always thought bright people in my class simply had the gifts to ace an examination, but it was a myth after all. This course has been an eye-opener to me as a person who always strives to learn. It has motivated me to question my ways of learning. I highly recommend it to everyone!
Thank you for this course! As someone going back to school for computer science, tools like this are so incredibly helpful and I am already implementing some of these strategies with great success. Dr. Oakley is also very inspiring to me as someone who discovered a love for math past high school. I am very excited to continue my lifelong journey of learning feeling more prepared than ever.
I was very pleased with this course. It was a great entry level, first course on coursera, type of learning experience that would propel you forward with a better understanding of the learning process. This course successfully provides you with the tools that you need to succeed within your academic endeavors and fortifies ambition as well as confidence that may be used for any curriculum!
This course proves to be a stepping stone on the journey you are about to embark regardless of your area of interest. I sincerely thank the instructors, Prof. Barbara Oakley and Prof. Terrence Sejnowsky,  for their time and efforts in creating a comprehensive and a thorough content for all learners.Kudos to the Coursera community for providing an engaging platform to its users.   Thank you
I found it very useful. The only regret is that I wish I knew about these mental tools earlier in my academic life. But I am glad that I took it now and will use newly acquired knowledge further in my life! The course looks simple but don't be fooled by that. I am sure  even experienced learners will find something new and useful. Big thanks to the creators of this course. You are amazing!
I recommend this course without reservation to everyone I meet. It has been one of the most transformative courses of my life. I'm a terrible procrastinator, and I've never yet had any of those self-help tips, books, apps, etc that worked. This course is the one thing that has me going steadily along the right track. Understanding the learning process is key to taking full advantage of it.
I would recommend this to everyone who wants to discover the right ways to study, memories and practice new material that you are trying to learn. Absolutely brilliant course with lots of explanations and details on the process of how your brain works/operates. Knowing this, you can take advantage and use it to your benefit to study much more efficiently. I have learned so much. Thank you!
This is one of the best courses on Coursera.  I would strongly recommend this to all those who want to learn anything. I was already enrolled in a course and was quite afraid of failure as I was studying after a very long time. This course gave me the confidence and the skill to learn anything. Now I want to learn programming and I am sure I will succeed. Thanks a lot Prof. Barbara Oakley.
Very dynamic and didactic. The way Dr. BArbara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowsky developed this important course for us students also applies many interesting ways of understanding in a more natural way as well as clear explanation of the methods on how to get a better approach when we are trying to learn something. Its a universal course every student should take to start a very successful career.
Great course! Dr Oakley not only clearly explained the concepts of learning in this course, but more importantly she taught us techniques that could be easily put into practice. I am trying to turn some of the ideas I learned from this course into habits (just like Dr Oakley said, "Practice makes permanent."). I highly recommend this course to those who try to be a more effective learner.
This was my first course on Coursera and I have to say it was amazing. The course material was delivered at a steady pace so that no one finds difficult to catch up. Itàs a perfect course for any beginner thinking to start their MOOC journey.I have learned a lot from this course, the instructors were really good, I enjoyed listening to them and looking forward to taking many more courses.
I would highly recommend this course to almost all people. It helps you to learn the new techniques and also helps you to find out the flaws you are currently bearing unknowingly. I will definitely implement the strategies and methods that I have learned in this course. Thank you so much to Dr. Barbara Oakley Mam,  Dr.  Sejnowski Sir, and the whole Coursera Team for this wonderful course.
This is really an useful course. Understanding the concepts of learning in turns helps in learning something new. The concepts explained in this course are simple, pictorial, easy to understand and easy to relate. Im feeling good about taking this course. Sincere thanks to Dr.Barbara Oakley & Terrence Sejnowsk taking this initiative. This course will have good impact on the lives of many.
This course is really helpful.  It helped to look at the things I was doing wrong in my learning process. It gave me an insight on how brain works. The course taught me the importance of sleep and taking breaks in between while studying.  The most important teaching I will always remember from this course is that anyone can learn anything, you need not be a genius to learn something new.
This course greatly reliefed my anxious and frustration and is especially helpful for me to tackle my procrastination problems. It takes time to try out the learning methods and tips mentioned in the videos, but I'm sure I'll gradually find out the most suitable learning tools for myself. I highly recommend this course! Many thanks to the professors for providing such a wonderful course!
This course offered great insight into the learning process and gave plenty of easy-to-apply solutions to deeper learning and overcoming procrastination. It also went through useful test taking tips and strategies. I'm leaving this course with a more thorough understanding of how my brain works, how to learn more deeply and effectively, and how to handle difficult test-taking situations.
I was quite stunned by this course. All key points were structured in a concise and clear manner. I have particularly enjoyed how the relationships between neurosciences and practical advices on how to learn were constantly highlighted. Also a great deal of the optional interviews were brilliant I thought. This was definitely a course I will remember and I will regularly refer myself to.
I've been trying to learn how to learn my entire long life. I can verify that what was taught in this class works! I had to figure out these things on my own though and it took almost an entire lifetime. If I had had this course when I was young, it would have changed my entire life. This course a priceless gem! It's put together extremely well and the contents are outrageously valuable.
It was a random choice that I made. But now I'm proud of making this choice. It helped me learn so much about the brain, it's working, and some interesting tips and tricks. It's "the most interesting and thought-provoking" subject. And huge respect for Dr. Babara Oakley and Dr.Terry Sejnowski. I wish I can meet you in person and hug you both for helping me and so many others. Thank you!
It was an exceptional course, which I believe should be taught in high school so that everyone could have a fair chance to become a master in tough subjects. I will personally recommend this course to my friends and all the mental tools that were taught in this course are really very helpful.Further, both the instructors in the course have taught each and every concept very beautifully.
This course helped me to understand how my brain works, why I procrastinate and methods I can use to help me learn. I also learned how to recognize habits and what I can to do to help myself when they are setting in. I am more patient with myself, it's very hard to stay focused and try to practice everyday , but I will try because I want to improve my brain and feel better about myself.
It is absolutely gem of the course. I wanted to upgrade my skills and learning here and there something. But the course gives a right perspective to review your learning. Many of things we know also but the way findings have been backed up by scientific research, it gives you more conviction to follow. In addition to that you can teach these learning to your growing kids.Thanks a lot!!!
it was very interesting, useful. Our teachers " Dr.Barbara Okaley and Dr. Sejnowski were very amazing. I have got a lot of information very useful for me. They illuminated the road to focus more on some things that would help me during study and life.they were active and every video i watch , i feel with them a positive energy and exciting.Thanks a lot for these efforts, thanks Coursera
Exceptionally useful course, should be the first one to take before starting to learn some new subject. Most of the things presented in the course I already knew, but couldn't quite grasp. It's all so well organized ans succinct, that it makes learning new stuff look like a piece of cake.Would recommend to anyone who wants to have a firm ground when heading to the path of new knowledge.
I find this course so helpful, i taught a lot of new skills and concepts. Being concentrated, focused and leverage your ability to enhance your learn was one of the topics that i ever suffer from.This course was the starting point and i think i'll listen for it after a while just to make sure i leveraged everything i can from it. Thanks a lot for Dr. Terry and Barbra for this great job.
This class was well thought out and easy to follow. I really enjoyed listening to Barbara Oakley's presentations with the funny graphics most, but Terry's S's material was well presented and extremely interesting; I look forward to being to implement the lessons from this course in every learning area of my life. I highly recommend this for any person interested in learning or teaching.
This was a great course! Really enjoyed studying it. It had a lot of interesting material, they course was created  based on the things that it is teaching! I recommend it, you will learn a lot of things, helps you notice what you were doing wrong with your studying, you will learn helpful techniques and interesting things about the brain and learning! I am glad that I took this course!
A lot of great tips. It's extremely important to know that it takes time and tremendous effort to become good with something. Don't fall into the trap and think that there are lots of people who are naturally good with math or sciences.Work hard, don't kid yourself, test yourself, repeat, rest, exercise, be holistic, believe you can improve... You will eventually become extremely good!
I'm very glad I took this course. It has inspired in me genuine motivation and high hopes for change, improvement and awareness. The welcoming, friendly way of presenting the information makes it so enjoyable to listen and watch. I felt relaxed and involved in every session. I learned many useful tips for all aspects in life. Thank you so much for sharing a most valuable tool for life.
A course that is worth investing time and effort. You will receive lots of valuable takeaways that will help you to be a better and more effective lifelong learner.The peer-review assignments are fun and challenging. Doing ithem helps help internalise your learning. Very useful course!Well done Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski! Thank you for helping us to learn how to learn.
I had terrible habits up until my junior year of university. I took this
 course and my study habits greatly improved. After practicing the teachings of this course, I got off academic probation and steadily 
improved my grades. 

The concepts taught in this course are very easy to grasp because of all the visual stimulation so it shouldn't be a problem. 

All in all, a great resource!
This course has helped  me in learning new techniques on how to learn. Ideas I have never thought about were discussed here in a simple and clear way anyone can understand. in addition some very useful mental tools as well. I used to learn by memorising a day before the test because I felt as if the pressure kept me motivated. I will follow the tools I get here from now on. Thank `you!
It is a great course about everything there is to know about learning. If you are curious about what techniques there is to avoid procrastination, improve your memory and control stress; this is the course for you. Also, It serves as a start to get into more deeply training methods as it introduces several important personalities on every subject so you can later dive into their works.
this course is the most amazing course I ever had. Because I did really hard in learning whenever High school or the college, however it does not work very well. Fortunately, my English writing teacher highly recommended “Learning how to learn” to me, and finishing this course makes me feel much better than before in my daily learning. Thank you very much for your teaching my teachers.
Great course for 3 reasons..1- learn how the mind works teaches you a lot about how to control it and control its impulses that prevent you from learning 2- actual teqhniques and tips that can help you control and enhance your focus and learning in measurable ways3 these techniques not only are good for learning but great as overall life skills like time management and better thinking.
The course is well structured and very well exposed. 

I found it easy to follow, even if the majority of the topics were new to me.

The course gives a clear understanding of a correct learning method and what are the most common errors to avoid.

I also found interesting suggestions about memorization techniques, like
 flash cards and the memory palace that I'm willing to adopt soon.
Of many things that life is about,it surely is about learning.This course is a must;no matter what discipline you are majorly from.It will help you to become a more efficient learner given that you work on the concepts,techniques mentioned.The way it has been presented only makes it more interesting,with humour,animations and interesting things.I enjoyed it very much.Do give it a try!!
I am telling everyone I meet to do this course. No matter where you are on life you should do this course if you are planning on learning. The course is well laid out. You change your habits as you learn about learning. I wish I had lecturers like Barbara Oakey and Terry S. When I was getting my initial education and its just amazing that I get get access to tho sort of lecture online.
This course has helped me a great deal to start punishing myself by studying on the same week of the exam and being sleep-deprived by the time I have to do my test. It has been a pleasure to learn all of the tips and tricks this course offers and I will surely learn from it, spread the word, and make this knowledge helpful for my future students when I become a professor! Thank you!!!
I came to know about this course from the book actually.I have already started making changes to the way I learn.There are some tips that are really helpful and I started implementing them right away.The claims in the course are supported with appropriate research papers.The teaching assistants replied to my doubts and queries immediately.Overall I'm highly satisfied with this course.
I love the learning techniques provided by course instructors. The course helped me to change my intuition about learning by setting good videos, documents, assignments, and quiz. It gives valuable lessons on how our brain/neural network function in the perspective of understanding and learning. It is one of the best course which I have learned and will keep on learning in the future.
Best Course ever! I wish I had taken this when I was in the 6th grade! I wish it was given to me every year to remind me. this is the best course I have ever taken. Because Now I can apply it to everything.And now my learning has accelerated. It explains how the brain works. In understanding this you can retain way more than you ever could before. That is important with all that I do.
This course is so applicable and practical for day-to-day learning and sharing :) In fact, it is so infectious that I have since shared the strategies/tips with my family and close friends; and introduced them to sign up for this MOOC via Coursera. Thank you very much for this awesome learning opportunity. Very grateful for the resources and sharing! Looking forward to my next MOOC :)
This is not just a course however it is a new perspective of learning with fun and also i would say that here they don't change YOU, they only change your habits which hinders your performances. It is a must course which everybody should step up for. Thank you so very much to the entire team and my heartfelt thanks to both the professors Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
This is so far the best course I have ever attended in Coursera. The presentations of the instructors  are very attractive and it is a pleasure to watch the videos. I got very different insights after listening to the course. Love Barbara's story ---- it provides me the courage to do something that I think I don't have talent at. I will definitely recommend this course to my friends.
It is quite useful a course cause it mentiones me part of the mistakes I made unawarely during my study and teaches me a lot of unusual learning techniques. The instructors use metaphor and anologies to help us understand the concepts and theories more actively and efficiently.          Thanks to the teachers, I gain more confidence in learning and challenging difficult subjects now.
I learned a lot from this class. This is not only a class that give you a right way to learning, handle your procrastination, the secret of memory, but also show you the scientific evidence. If a scientist tell me that the procrastination is not a big deal, I will believe that more than just somebody tell me. Also, this class gave me the passion and confidence to learn something new.
I only wish this course had been available when I was in high school - 50 years ago. My son, now 27, also took this course and we recently spent some time discussing it and appreciating it. It is not only what is taught in this course but how it is taught. The material is made accessible, memorable, and enriching by Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski.Thank you for it, --Peter Jackson, Arizona
This is a class that everyone should take. It applies not only on tests for students but furthermore, for everyone who wishes to learn continuously throughout his/her life time (any subject). It helps tremendously knowing that there are techniques that you can exercise and practice in order to enrich the learning experience, and most vitally, absorbing and remembering what you learn.
This course has been very helpful to me. I learned a lot of very interesting teaching methods. I really liked the style of presentation of Barbara Oakley and Mr. Terrence Sejnowski. I am very grateful to them. I use the knowledge gained in my work with students. I do not know English very well, but I was able to take the course with the help of a translator, it raised my self-esteem
Learning How to Learn has been a tremendously interesting adventure! Although my university days are behind me, I learned a lot that I can use in my professional life. Moreover, the course reaffirmed good learning habits that I picked up in the past. The material is explained very well and the additional Honors assignment were a fun exercise in consolidating the material in my mind.
Really this course gave me a new insight about learning art.  After started incorporating those techniques, feeling myself new wrt learning.   Though it is taking quite time & discipline, but still the techniques really works very well. Hope by continuing this forever, let me revamp myself going forward swiftly.  I suggest everyone to take up this course.  Thanks to the Instructors.
Super efficient for me. When my friend recommended me to take this course, I failed the exam several times. However I still did not reflect back on my study method, and I even ignored his advice to take the course. At that time, I believed in myself that, studying longer hours will only lead to success, which is absolutely not. Now I am super thankful to my friend. Thank you Sergey!
This course is really valuable, every student in the world must follow it, because education is the only key to make our brain grow up. Sometimes we feel we cannot learn something in life, but with this kind of tools shown during the course, any people can get it. If we understand our brain, our own process of learning, among others, our lives could change for better. Thanks a lot!!
Brilliant course! Though I wished the quizzes incorporated (one of the learning tips in the course) interleaved distributed practice, e.g. testing week 2's material in week 3, etc. Also, the wrong answers in quizzes tended to be not tricky enough, i.e., someone who hasn't learned the material adequately could just do the quizzes and pass, since the wrong answers are obviously wrong.
Very enjoyable and helpful course best way to speed up learning and save lot's of time you can spend with friends and relatives instead of wasting it with bad and time consuming learning methods. So before signing up for the next course consider first signing up for LEARNING HOW TO LEARN and see how you can make your next course a much more fun experience once you know how to learn.
Wish I had this information a few decades ago while I was in college.  Looking forward to using this now as I recover from a TBI.  I am 1 year post concussion and am still having issues with processing and learning information.  I had difficulty reading and was off work for 10 months.  My back ground is chemical engineering and zero emission vehicle technologies and infrastructure.
One of the best courses I have ever done! And I have done quite a few (got up to masters degree). I loved every bit of it!Great lecturers! Easy to listen to. All the time whilst learning, I kept thinking of how much time and energy I have lost over the years of learning wrongly. Thank you for this opportunity and knowledge. I hope to use it by helping my children in their learning.
This is a great course, full of helpful, easy-to-digest information, relayed in a friendly, positive, repetitive manner. Points were repeated in similar fashions, to express the same meaning, but show from a slightly different vantage point to further ingrain the material. Frequent use of personal insight questions helped to cement the information further into the long term memory.
Engaging, witty, informative, compulsive, persuasive and effective. Nothing fancy, just a smart presenter putting it over in a way that makes sense supported by the science and academic papers that give it credibility. Yet so many people have tried to do this in the past? It is the magic of combining an online platform that is of its age and works, and someone with a story to tell.
If your your are looking for the  formula to use your brain with more efficiency. Take this course right now. And the end of the course, i was mixed with two feelings why haven't i enrolled myself earlier and welcome to a new-me ready to explore an ocean of new subjects .   I send a warm thanks to Barb and Terence for the quality of their work and for having shared their knowledge.
This course was the most efficient and complete I've ever watched. I'm so gratefull that I have an opportunity to enhance my learning skills. These materials can be called 'gold' without any doubts. I will try to put in practice everything I've got in this course. Also, I want to say a tremendous  Thank You to the creators and participants of this course! This work was worth doing.
Before starting or learning any course of your interest, I would urge you to First Do THIS course completely and then, I am sure the efficiency of learning  will drastically increase and will give a feeling of satisfaction.I would like to Thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for such a great course material and the learning experience which they shared.BR/Mukul Bisen
This is an excellent course, I wish I had taken it earlier. The Coursera interface is not intuitive for me - In fact I thought I had completed the course however only realized that I hadn't when I received a request for a poll on why I didn't complete the course!  I did end up finishing the course, you have to keep clicking on "next" to get past many things to get to the very end.
This course was insightful. I have experienced a paradigm shift in the way I used to understand learning. I had my set of mental blocks that prevented me from enjoying the learning process. I had reached a point in my life where learning new concepts were more of a burden. And procrastination had affected most aspects of my life. This course has changed the way I look at learning.
I would like to leave a word of appreciation to Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence, and Coursera, for creating a great course on learning available to anyone on the globe. I believe concepts such as chunking, the difference between focused and diffused modes, working and long-term memory, and suggestions for dealing with procrastination, will be empowering for anyone taking this course!
I can't recommend this course highly enough. It's probably the single most important course I've taken so far in anything. It doesn't require much time or effort, but the outcome is pretty mindblowing, at least for a person who is used to slave away for nothing like me. Since I've applied the learning techniques from this course, my studying has become much more effecient and fun!
First of all, thank you very much for sharing the material. It was really helpful and I feel that I benefit from it now. I have changed my approach to learn and now I keep in mind all the important thing that you have mentioned during the course. Therefore, I think I will recommend this course to everyone, who wants to improve their studying performances. Once again, thanks a lot!
It provides me many important and new knowledge or ideas about learning based on the research result of Neuroscience. It makes me start to look at myself, my brain and what I can achieve in a new way. Nice and interesting lecture! Also you will find how this course differ from other courses on Coursera in many details, as well as how the course instructors care for their students!
It was a really interesting course, with great ideas and lots of tips to boost one's learning process. The optional interviews was a great bonus as well. What made it even more wonderful is the weekly mails I get now from the instructors of this course, Barb and Terry, with suggested books and MOOC's. So glad that I decided to join this and completed it. Thank you for creating it!
I've only finished the 1st week, yet, I can say that LH2L is very effective. My learning abilities have greatly improved. It helps a lot to understand how our brain works for a more effective learning. It is so good that I am going to buy the book "A Mind for Numbers". Thanks Barbara Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, and everyone else for making this course free and available to everybody :)
It should be mandatory to have this type of material as part of a regular curriculum in the earlier years of a student path. This course shows, with a rigorous foundation, the way we learn and how we can improve ourselves with different techniques. I liked that through the course it was emphasized that we can, with a positive attitude and perseverance, achieve what we truly love!
Life Tranforming Material: Highly Qualified, Very well Trained Instructors ,They have done brilliant work in producing this course.This course is filled with enormous amount of authentic research.I am an academician who had lost touch with learning with a fresh eye have got new perspective.Highly recommended to all Teachers,Professors and everyone who wants to learn How to learn.
I enjoyed the course and especially the tone set by Dr Oakley who maintained high quality and a light spirit throughout the teachings. I loved the way things came together for me as an older person and how they reinforced old ideas from the past. Well done to the team and to Coursera. If it wasn't Covid-19 time and my business limping, I would have purchased the course willingly.
This was a great class to learn how your brain functions, how YOU learn best, as well as a few tips and tricks for test-taking. Barbara Oakley was a wonderful professor in this series - she used tricks throughout the sessions to make sure you were learning while you went through the course. She also sent out loads of resources to follow up and dive into. I would highly recommend!
I can't help but imagine a world where everyone know how to learn properly. So many people have dropped out of school or simply neglected their education during all their lives because they feel anxious and ultimately hate it. Imagine if they did not need to feel like that as much, as this course teaches us. How many brilliant ideas and scientists and ideas would have flourished?
I completed this course!Coming to this course with some initial doubts, I ended up learning more than expected. There were times that I thought I would not continue the course due to my hectic schedule. However, Dr. Oakley is a great teacher, as she always managed to inspire and instil the thirst for knowledge in me. Can't thank her enough for sharing her useful pieces of wisdom.
One of the best short courses available for learning how to learn, I love all the new tools that you have enabled me to use.  I am looking forward to my new adventure and tackling a diploma, and now feel confident with the learning process and best I can apply this to my new course. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Only one more word to describe the experience I have undertaken.
It has helped me , because I want to be a better student. I'm studying engineering and I want to do well in my career , but I find it difficult and I think that if I follow the advice of this course , I can do it better. I would also like to improve my English ( I am from Spain ) and practice a little every day with the pomodoro technique . Thank you so much, you helped me a lot.
I really enjoyed this course.  This course is a great blend of neuroscience and actual learning tactics and principles.  Both Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski present solid information in a casual yet informed manner and make staying on the course very interesting.  I find the techniques described very useful for any endeavor that requires focused learning for a lifetime.  Excellent!
A great insight towards how the brain is a beautiful and exquisite intermingle of complexity and at the same time simplicity. The techniques mentioned in the course are really helpful  towards enhancing the productivity of the brain and the concepts provided puts light on not only the cause of the daily shortcomings faced by many people but also how to tackle these shortcomings.
Great course. All the tools that are proposed can be used ASAP therefore you area able to see how using this strategies work. Also I loved the fact that I had an explanation of how does this strategies work on a neurological level. I had been told to use certain techniques but I was doubtful and did not tried them before, now I have learned also to give myself a chance to do it.
This course has been my company during my morning commute to work and I couldn't be happier.The videos are easy to watch, the information is easy to retain and there are funny jokes along the way.Thank you so much for your work, I learned many techniques to improve my learning capacity and I understand better how the brain works! It made me curious to learn more about our brain.
So far, I really like the Course. I think Barbara and Terrence are really nice. I liked it very much, that Barbara told us a bit about her life. It showed me that it is never to late to start with something new. I also like they way they explain things. Really simple and very understandable. I am pretty sure I will apply a lot of things. I am looking forward to the next Session.
Provides practical and applicable insights into how the physiology of the brain impacts learning.  You learn what the brain is doing when you study, and how to maximize your study time.  This course greatly aided my retention and understanding for my comprehensive exams in law.  Strongly recommended for anyone interested in learning, whether in math, science, humanities, or law.
I think this lesson is quite different from the others, for it offers some new methods of how to learn better ,which I have not heard before. Surprisingly, it gives us quite a lot of information about the relationship between our learning skills and architecture of our brains.I think this lesson matters a lot in my whole life, for I am always learning new things on my life way.
I wish I had discovered this course before I graduated from my university. It took me a while to discover by trial and error some of the concepts from the course which would make my university time much more productive and some of the concepts were totally new to me. I hope other people will be more lucky than I was and will discover and incorporate this much earlier in life :)
The course is introduces you to many practice techniques to improve your learning.  The potential field application is extremely broad and I think that this is why its the most popular course.  I think it would be helpful to improve upon the practical area of the course by having things like "ok pause this video and go exercise" to really embed the suggestions into us students.
I expected to learn a bunch of study strategies from this course but instead, I've learned how our brains work, and it especially helped in building mindfulness and positive thinking, not just learning a new subject.Although those study strategies are definitely useful while learning a new subject, the whole course's material is applicable to the concept of learning in general.
Although I have already practiced ~80% of the techniques taught in this course (i.e. Pomodoro, spaced repetition, getting enough sleep, recall, testing self, etc.), I still learned new things, and this course convinced me that I've been doing the right things but can make some improvements. I especially love the zombies! They remind me of Plants vs. Zombies in an endearing way.
Very informative with great references for those who want to dive deeper not only into practical steps for great learning but also into the psychology and neuroscience of learning. With lecturers that seem genuinely passionate about the subject matter and test-questions that are neither too hard nor seeking excessively personal information. Feels so great learning how to learn!
Very beneficial course, telling you how your brain works and how you can get the most out of it, you do not have to be genius or gifted to have a good memory or do great stuff. Your brain is a gift and you can just know how to use it. many techniques I have learned to be used during studying any subject. I even learned how to overcome procrastination and help improve my memory
Out of tenths of MOOCs i have started, i've only finished two, and this is the second of them. If you know about MOOCs statistics, that would say enough, but not to be so short in words, the course is good and keeps you engaged because it teaches you usable, applicable concepts, that require just a fair amount of time to go through, and that are taught in a accessible way. 5/5
Extremely useful course. I wish I had been exposed to this information two decades ago. I have started to use techniques learned not only in studying but also in other areas of both my personal and professional life. Learning is part of our personal lifelong evolution. It is a gift to learn how to improve this process. Thanks to the professors for their wonderful contribution.
This course was very beneficial on my current studies.  It reminded me to not push myself, but to know when to take a break and sort out problems later.  Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski really lightened up my understanding and I can't wait to start the next course "Mindshift". Overall, this course was very interesting to learn about. May you all have a great study session!
Very refreshing and a great course to understand how to brain works. It provides lot of techniques to improve your ability to learn and understand things which you are both interested in and even the ones which you fear and procrastinate. I will recommend this course to everyone irrespective of their backgrounds to take this course and become a better learner. Happy Learning!
Learned so much, is very much so learning the science of your brain and how to apply that science to everything in life. I believe if you actually applied all these things to your core skills and habits you could achieve an amazing level of non-stop efficiency. At very first the videos seem kind of dated and a little slow, but you quickly get into it and respect the speakers.
A very useful course! Especially together with a book Mind for Numbers!I knew about the Pomodoro technique before, but I wasn't enthusiastic enough to use it. But after getting to know that it's better to concentrate on the process not on the product during that course, this Pomodoro technique has more sense for me now and I am more likely to use it. Thank you for the course!
A spectacular course for anyone who is having a difficult time learning subjects that are new to them, or who is working on completing a long-term project, or just anyone who likes to learn but wants to optimize their learning habits. This class is absolutely super for all of those needs and has helped me quite a lot. Thanks so much!! :) It gets an A+ in my book, for sure! ;)
This course taught me how to learn, introduced me to a lot of other things I wanna learn about, it taught me how to teach, it taught me how to read! (I had it completely wrong!) it taught me, to some extent, how to remember. And most importantly, it taught me how to beat procrastination. I am already teaching two people these course's techniques. Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley!
Excellent course! Really easy to understand and apply to your own studies. If you are wanting to get better grades on exams or more fully understand the material you are learning in class (or at work/in life) this course is super helpful in teaching you how to use research in neuroscience to memorise material, avoid procrastination and overall improve your learning abilities!
This course is full of great ideas on how to effectively learn and understand different subjects, its helpful in every area of life, I'm happy that I took part in this course and grateful to the people that put this materials together and also to the nice and wonderful Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski that delivered this course. It will surely help me in life going forward.
This course was amazing! I truly believe the content in this course can help so many struggling students who incorrectly think they are "not smart". Using these techniques, especially at an early age, can drastically change someone's life. I wish I knew this information when I was in school! Great teachers, amazing content. One of the best Coursera courses I have ever taken!
I really enjoyed this course and found the lessons to be invaluable. I have always been very curious and an enthusiastic learner but never approached my learning in a strategic fashion. This course has equipped me with many tools to improve the efficiency and efficacy of my learning which I have already begun to implement. Barabara Oakley is also a wonderful course director!
At this point in my life I am a professional. So much wish that I had the chance to see this when in high school or college. I've learned some of the techniques on my own through trial-and-error, and it would have saved me so much time. Will recommend the class to family and friends who are interested in self improvement. Thank you for putting together such a treasure chest!
This course was an obscenely pleasing and satisfying experience for me. The lecture videos were very helpful,in the real life. It was indeed very educational. The lecturer Dr. Oakley, i should specify on, had a specific kind of teaching method, which was very very clear and easy to learn. Overall, the whole course was an beautifully emanating experience. Thanks. To everyone.
Course was informative and well-paced. The videos were superbly recorded and points explained. It is suitable for students in school as well as adults trying to learn something new which can be quite hard at their age. A fresh perspective or insight into learning is always beneficial and this course can either surprise you or completely change the way you learn. Worth a try!
Thanks to Barbara and her colleagues for this wonderfull course! it was interesting, helpful, easy to understand and fascinating :-) i enjoyed the images and videos within the course, the tests and questions after each video were very helpful to pass the final test and practise all the techniques (such as recall, mini tests  etc) which were described and suggested at course.
I would like to take this chance to sincerely thank Dr Barbra Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for been the most helpful instructor of my life. What I have learn in this course, I wish I had known those things 40 years ago. These two Instructors made me a new person in my search for knowledge. Thanks a million for making me discover the power of my brain. May God bless you.
It is a great course, pleasant and easy to follow. It shows us how to do what we have to do better. From the topics of how to tackle procrastination, all the knowledge about einstellung, short- and long-term memory, chunking, creating vivid analogies and metaphors, avoiding overconfidence, etc, all this knowledge has a direct impact on the adequate completion of our duties.
This is an awesome course and helped me to learn and unlearn some of the concepts about brain functioning while learning and also teaching effective techniques to learn. The study materials, course tests and videos from masters have helped to feel more confident and am sure that I can learn anything new with this methodology. Thank you Barb and Terry for this great course !
This course was sooo useful!  I am starting college in the fall and thought this might help me; it definitely will.  The main instructor is great; she explains things very well.  If I learned one thing from this course, it is that I need to go back and forth between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.  Just that one thing has helped me immeasurably since I've learned it.
Great experience with great instructors. Able to get familiar with new ways of learning and new concepts that are very helpful for higher education and learning.I would really like to thank both the instructors for sharing great information and help us for our future. Its been a really good four week session with immense knowledge.Thanks a lot for such a great opportunity.
This was a wonderful course. I enjoyed and learned mental frameworks and tools thoroughly. I'm sure they will help me with whatever I will learn in my future. I wish I had encountered this course previously. Plus the optional interviews with deeply passionate individuals and some Nobel Laureates were extremely insightful. Truly there are so many ways to approach learning.
I wish that this was a subject of it's own in the high school curriculum in Australia!The tools presented are certainly useful in the approach of learning but very much applicable to many other areas of my own lifestyle. This course has certainly provided both motivation and stimulation for me to enhance aspects of my life previously lacking in effort.Thank you very much!
Learning how to learn is truly inspiring, especially thanks to Barbara Oakley. Everybody starting his or her school/ university life should have access to this knowledge. It is really sad that none of my teachers ever showed us how to learn and why. But I guess they didn't know better themselves. But learning never stops, so I am looking forward to use this knowledge now.
I can't explain how much this course has changed my attitude and thoughts towards learning!! It will definitely help me throughout my life, from schooling, all the way to my future career goal and dream. I thank the professors, Ms. Oakley and Mr. Sejnowski, profusely for teaching us the skills and techniques for learning, as well as opening our doors to a brighter future!
An amazing course, explains complex topics really easy, entertaining to watch, knowing that i am learning.I am a person who has trouble concentrating and learning, i´ve seen benefits in my learning by using techniques shown in this course, i really enjoyed it  and thank you for teaching me how to learn propperly and not just memorizing everything just for tests at school
Amazing! the course recommendation is to take in 4 weeks but was so interesting and with so usable learnings that were simple to understand and enjoyable to watch that I finished the whole course in 1 week. I profoundly recommend it! The techniques and explanations about how our brain works are super useful and clear and easy to understand. It is time very well-invested!
It was a fun course! It affirmed what most of us who have found success in academics have been doing for years, so it was nice to find out that these techniques have been appointed names. I will do my best to pass on this information to others who are climbing that academic mountain. Thank you guys for doing this. I will be looking at the references for more information.
A fantastic course! Thank you for challenging the way I used to think about learning - and keeping me mindful of spending more time on problem questions instead of trying to read every piece of information in the textbook. I know now that I need to spend more time applying what I learn and testing myself instead of trying to understand the minute detail of every concept.
This is one of the best courses on learning how to learn. Both the instructors,  Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have used an unique teaching technique. With useful tools such as pomodoro, learners are able to apply the tools easily. This course dwells into how our brain learns, and thus help us in capitalizing the brain's learning mechanism to the fullest.
This is improving my strength towards completing courses. I like it a lot.A humble request is please upload video lectures of duration more than 15 min. After watching a video we are relaxing. If videos are of small duration I will take much time for us to complete lectures as it includes more relax time. If videos are of more duration we can complete them in small time.
This course is literally changing my life. Discovering various tools for learning and figuring out which ones and in which combinations work best for me has been an interesting and fruitful journey. Studying for GRE has become fun for me. In short, I like it so much! Thank you for creating this thoroughly thought through course and for allowing to access it indefinitely.
I took this course to alienate my habitual procrastination habits and to improve my learning. Admittedly, a part of me was curious and now I know why. I have learned about tricks and techniques that will forever change the way I  study and how I approach procrastination issues and how to avoid falling into old habits.My sincere Thanks to Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski!
It was a wonderful experience doing this course. I knew a few things before but have gained an invaluable insight into how the brain works and many new techniques on how to improve my learning. I did this course in preparation for a University degree and I feel well prepared for it now.Many thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for creating this wonderful course!
It is quite a helpful course for me. I spent much time in thinking about how to study more efficiently. Lots of the techniques the course mentioned are aligned with my past observations, and now I learn more about its theory. I am going to use most of these methods in my graduate study and check its effectivity. Thanks a lot for all people that give such a great course.
I
have learned very much from this course. Somethings I already knew, but I never
stopped and thought about what it meant with regarding to learning. I'm already
using my new-found knowledge with my students. Teaching them not only history
(my subject) but also how they should tackle the problem of remembering and
identifying the important concepts. Thank you very much!
This course illustrates how to learn in the best ways with alternative methods. The course inspires me a lot and solve some of my learning doubts and difficulties I faced before. Every study struggle has a reason behind! Thanks for this course which open the door to be a better learner, the remaining pathway is to practice these techniques and being passion in learning.
At the beginning of the course I felt scared in going back into learning. Taking this course has helped me feel excited about learning and it gives me the confidence in choosing other more challenging subjects. I feel the need to continue with my learning and am sure that the techniques learned in this course will make a difference in the outcome of my future education.
This course is such a fun and useful one. The videos are short but sharp enough to let you learn and remember the lectures. The course can also be very helpful in everyday life no matter what your proficiency is. The interviews are great. This course will literally help you with many other courses that you are going to take and it is a fundamental for education,I think.
This course is very helpful and teaches you techniques to further your education. Learning How to Learn should be taught in middle school and then again when entering high school. Allot of kids really need to hear and learn this information at an early age. Thank you University of California and a big thanks to Coursera for organizing these courses for all to take !!!!!
I enjoyed this course and definitely recommended for anyone who wanted to improve their life. If you are a student in which about to take a tough course, this should come to you first hand and it will guaranteed to ease out your learning. Thank you Barbara Oakley and Dr Terry Sejnowski! All the best to you all. Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching. <3
This course was straight forward, precise, and clear about it. The instructors' voices were clear and no jargon going on during the discussion. As per the topic, I've learned a lot about different types of techniques as I wish I learn them earlier on in my life. Nevertheless, it was never too late as I will apply them continuously throughout my life and to my children.
thanks a lot for this course and all how worked on it and make it that easy to understand even for foreign natives, I am my self have no problem with English but yet I found the subtitle very good, unlike some other courses on same platform <3 thanks Dr. Oakley tanks  Dr. Sejnowski  I am really glad that I took this course and that I meet someones like u even online <3
Thanks Dr. Oakley for offering such a n amazing course. I got to know alot of about how my thinking/learning process work. I was doing alot of wrong things when learning anything new. Now I have effective tools and knowledge, how to improve the learning process. I recommend this course to everyone no matter what they are they are trying to learn, this course will help.
I really relished this wonderful course! The mentors are very welcoming and make you feel comfortable. Throughout the course, I learnt a countless number of techniques to improve my learning and studying. If you are a passionate learner whose goal is to achieve great heights, this course is perfect for you! Hats off to Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski and the others.
its an amazing course, not only for students, teachers but also for practitioners of all fields. because every body has to learn some thing new, to be updated. Usually every body faces, anxiety of learning, fear of exams and some time exhaustive and not getting whats, presented to them. Authors came up with many techniques to tackle all the problems related to learning
It is one of the most practical courses in Memory and learning I found on this platform.The techniques and tools you get to understand and the way the things of the brain are simplified for a student of any background to understand is the USP of this course.For me, it was a lovely experience to learn how to learn under course designers Dr B. Oakley and Dr T. Sejnowski.
In one word? GREAT! If this is your first time on coursera, you should start with this course. It's dynamic, entertaining and provides you with the fundamentals of learning more efficiently. Afterwards, you'll be more prepare for whatever course you take. I wish I had taken this course 20 years ago ;). I am truly thankful with Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
This class should be taught to everyone in school, no later than the fourth grade! I loved the material and found it to be immensely interesting.  I utilized some of these techniques without even knowing it, but the ones I adopted from the course will serve me for a lifetime.  So much to gain from this class, and it is so short, you would be crazy not to go through it.
I really liked this course. Dr. Oakley did a great job. I've already used some of the methods mentioned in this course to go after some work certifications that I've had difficulty with. I am a huge procrastinator and I felt like this course was created for me and people like me to try and get a handle on my ever challenging issue that I battle with everyday. Thank you
Great course! It helps me a lot with my learning routine, show me what works and what doesn´t work based on a neurological level and how to change my learning habits.  Many useful techniques on how to learn, how to remember, why we procrastinate and why we feel stress and how to deal with it. It´s necessary for everybody who wants to improve his life, not just grades.
A great course which provided valuable insight in the importance of learning effectively. I am especially appreciative of the material that I was presented with, and am grateful of the lessons that the instructors provided me. Now, on to Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential, which I believe will also be an excellent course.
This course is definitely an eye-opener not only for learning in academics, but in learning in life in general! Not only was it super interesting through and through, but it was actually very practical. It literally gives you the tools to be able to tackle any challenging task that involves learning, time and effort. I wish I had taken this before or while in college!
Truly amazing course! I was having a lot of problems before I started it and it gave me a lot of useful tips. I am not going to lie to you - this is not some secret key to life and success that magically transforms every aspect of your learning, but if you follow the guidelines and practice you will see real change. 10/10 would and already have recommended to friends.
For a free course, this was very useful.  I found myself talking about the things I was learning in this course while I was taking it and I was more aware of why my brain was doing certain things.  I feel I am more prepared to take on new material easier and more efficiently which will be very helpful in my area of study - machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Great course with even greater material. Loved both the instructor, especially Dr. Barbara Oakley. She has such a nice voice and composure of a heavenly teacher that it just inspires you from the inside. I wish I would have gotten a teacher like her in my earlier life. Still, I will carry the lessons in my future learnings and definitely teach my kids the same things.
First of all, thanks for everything, Coursera!! I can't even put it into words how much what I've learned here is helping me! I'd like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart! I'm simply overwhelmed with many things I simply had no idea that could be blocking my learning path! I can't wait to see the other coursera's videos!Thanks for the knowledge!!Best wishes!!
A great beginner course for all people of different backgrounds. There really is plenty of scope to explore and share ideas. Also the more you put into the course the more you get out of it. The presentation was enthusiastic and lively. provides good grounding to go further into many subjects of how we learn and also become more effective in life long learning sector.
Although many of good learning ideas mentioned in this course can be seen somewhere, it is the vivid and clear way of teaching that make the course wonderful and let the ideas be easy to remember.  Besides, optional interviews are really helpful because the interviewers from different fields provided many excellent learning tips and habitats, it can broaden your view.
From this course I learned some skills that help me focus on the tough materials and  sharpen my mind on my long-term goals. By concentrating on the process, which is the concept I learned from here, I am more able to accomplish more even if there is a lot of difficulties during my journey of success. I really appreciate Barbara and Terry for their brilliant lectures!
Well, this course is one of best course I've ever participated in. In middle of course I bought dr Barbara Oakley book "A Mind for Numbers:" in my native language Polish (Głowa do liczb), and it's very very good. I strongly believe that this course will improve my scholar skills. Every participant should note that this course is not about theory but everyday practice!
I wish I poped into this course when I was a student. It would have allowed me to use 5 years spent in university more effectively. But better late than never, I still have plenty of time to learn bunch of stuff. This course in not only about different techniques and tricks to boost your learning, but it also can give you a new perspective on your abilities to learn.
I loved both the professors in this course, especially Dr. Barbara Oakley. Her enthusiasm for the material and goofy but genuine personality kept me engaged. I also found the material covered here very useful - I have already started applying it in my learning of guitar and Chinese - and I plan on retaking the course in the future when I go back for my second degree.
This course provides a useful foundation about how we learn, in addition to useful strategies to help improve our ability to learn by adjusting our environment, our expectations, and techniques. Some of the best parts of this course are the optional reading resources and interviews. I certainly wish I had this insight when I was just beginning high school or college.
I wish I had known about these learning techniques as I struggled through high school and some college. Kids of all ages should have access to the techniques and tips presented by these great instructors. And teachers of those kids should definitely know these techniques so they don't pound kids with the wrong ways to learn . . or not learn, as it so often turns out.
A marvelous course that has helped me a lot in pinpointing nonefficient study techniques I've been using so far.  The course presented a lot of science-based techniques that manipulate the particularities of the brain, transforming potential weaknesses into valuable insights. I think it was the first online course I actually made myself finish. I highly recommend it!
It's a great course, which is very helpful to learn some difficult things. Thanks very much. The only problem is my English is too weak to follow the English subtitle, so I have to  use Chinese subtitle. Anyway,  the course teach me how to learn in a better way, I will introduce it to my students. Thanks again. BTW, it's my first course which is finished in Coursera.
The course was vary enjoyable and extremely practical. Every idea presented is very easily applicable and very valuable to any active learner. Moreover, the course itself is organised to be studied very effectively, and facilitates high retention of the material. Additionally, optional reading allows for a broader perspective and deepened exploration of the material.
I went to school for more than 20 years and I have been working for over 15 years, yet this course taught me thinks I wished I had known 30 years ago.  I am sure it will help me a better learner, more focused and it will take me less effort to learn new things (which I have already started by the way, applying some of the techniques from the course). Thanks for that.
Wow. Simply loved this course. Really helpful and life changing habbits learning how to learn is probably the first thing we all ought to learn when young children. 28 now. But it is never to late to learn how to learn. Thank you for putting together such a tremendous course. I would like to have the certificate for it however it is too expensive for me at this time.
It is really very interesting and helpful in understanding how our brain works and how learning develops. It provides tips for avoiding bad habits that make studying difficult and points the way to effective methods to improve one's learning skills. Useful knowledge for anyone who approaches to study any subject. The course is developed in a pleasant and simple way.
Easily one of the best instructional courses/material I have ever engaged with. Barbara's empathetic nature in combination with the structured way the course has done made this experience not only informative, but enjoyable. It does make you wonder why schools have not yet started to implement this as a course or a mandatory requirement to advance to the next grade.
This course is the best and the most powerful course PERIOD. Before learning any course or skill one must take this course and read ' A Mind For Numbers' so that it will open the neural pathway and help you understand how to grasp the concept of learning how to learn any subject or skill. Thanks Coursera and Dr. Oakley and her team of experts for the enlightenment .
This was a great course. I wish I had taken it before I began my studies in engineering. I would have tried to relax more and have fun!  I can also attest to the importance of repetition and testing yourself in memorizing subject matter. I used those techniques for law school, and they worked so well for me. Whenever I used those techniques, I got an A in the class.
I just retired in June.  I now have a number of challenging goals that I want to accomplish.   This useful course will help me accomplish them.  This course has taught me that  it is the process, the new habits, that are important in this journey.   Thank you Dr.Barb Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for making such an interesting, understandable, and important course.
Learning how to learn should become mandatory at schools and not just for higher classes. THAT is the single most important skill students will need in their future lives. But even for those late beginners like myself, it's not too late. This course is gold and should stand at the beginning of any studying endeavor - unless you already know how to learn effectively.
Excellent training action, very enriching and of great impact at a personal level and therefore professional, is a course with a higher level of organization and a unique pedagogical design despite being such a complex and broad subject. My sincere congratulations to all the team that makes this beautiful activity possible, especially to Dr. Barbara as its director.
Absolutely fantastic course!! I found this course by chance last month when I was searching for study tips. I'm so glad I found this course. This course content has been presented so well and the teachers are so nice. I recommend this course to everyone because problems like procrastination are universal. So, learning how to overcome these problem is really helpful.
It was a great course to know about different way to study. In the seccsions, professors showed us plenty skills and tips about how to change our mind to face tough subjects. It was wonderful to know about Diffuse Mode and Zombies inside us, which are helpful for us to really know about our weakness during study. Try this course, you will find it's fun and valuable.
this course gives necessary material in understanding how brain works and how to get benefits from it. it also inspires greatly, becuse the main idea lies in human's ability to learn and master almost everything, but much practice and patience is needed to achieve that. I wish I could take this course when I was at school and escaping math and other hard sciences =)
This course was great. I learned so much on how the brain works, which led of course to all the helpful ways to learn. The lessons most importantly boosted my self confidence, thank you especially for that! Both Professors were excellent, easy to listen to and follow! I would love to take any class with them! Yes i do plan on taking more online courses!!!!Thank you
Great techniques  paired with  learnings that can be applied as you go throug the course itself! This is especially encouraging if your looking into taking on more courses or just want a refresh yourself on how to best Learn how to learn. I can positvely confirm that i'll be looking at my notes often going forward  and might even look into courses on neuroscience .
At the beginning, i was like "Ooo Boy", but slowly as time goes, with all those videos and quizzes and not forgetting the relax and casual manners of both the tutors, i beginning to enjoy it. This course opened up my eyes and of cause my mind that there is a smarter way to learn. thank you to both of the tutors and all the contributors in making this course worthy.
Such an excellent course- well planned and presented. I especially appreciated the personal experiences and the interviews with extraordinary people, including the presenters themselves. I will certainly employ the techniques promoted in this course and understand better how my brain works and how to train it in a more effective way. I highly recommend this course.
I enjoyed this course. The concepts of focused verses diffused thinking was quite helpful and there were a number of other tools that I was able to use and to share with my college age daughter. I sincerely believe in life long learning and will use the concepts and tools I got from this course to enhance my learning in the days and years to come! Highly recommend.
Starts off at first, alarmingly easy but then very cleverly builds a more complex understanding of memory and learning. I found it very useful and it has changed my thinking about learning in very practical ways. I am very excited about new learning in a way I haven't before. I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn and remember more effectively.
I've been learning different things for about 20 years but I haven't systematically been taught "how to learn" until I met this course. This course is inspirational to me. The instructors use creative methods to illustrate not only techniques but also scientific foundations behind the learning techniques. Really appreciate all the efforts that you made! Thank you!
I highly suggest this course as a start point for any high school or college student (or anyone really). I learned the BASICS of effective learning and only those were good enough to pass two of my last exams with the highest score. I am looking forward to watching all of the additional material in this course and to read some of the books related to these topics.
This course was excellent.  I am an educator and learned many valuable learning strategies in this course.  This material presented is helpful to students and educators and  will enhance the learning process and make your learning time more efficient.  Combining the Science of the brain with the learning strategies was a very effective way to present the material.
One of the best ways I've spent my time. So easily explained, short concise and to the point, so well done. I just wish they had taught me this at school! I also absolutely love both the teachers, Barbara is just adorable and so funny. I recommend it to almost everyone I know, no matter what they do in life. They even have subtitles for those non-English speakers!
Barbara Oakley has such a lovely personality! I'm thoroughly enjoying this course. I never thought that my learning difficulties were all related to the way I've been studying. Simple adjustments learnt in this course here and there and boom, finally tackling hard subjects confidently, and more importantly retaining it! I can't recommend this course highly enough.
This is one of the best courses in Coursera. This changes the way you study about a subject regardless of the field that you want to specialise in. Education psychology is one of the key things that helps  you teach children how to learn. I believe if you know how to learn, you can learn anything!. Must take.. I am taking this for the second time in the same year.
The material is interesting, It has short videos that target the learning objective that are also very useful. It's a great course. I learned a lot! I am very thankful to the Drs. who took the time to prepare this and Coursera to offer this course. I highly recommend it if you want to learn new techniques to help you in remembering and learning anything you want.
Barbara and Terrence,Thank you so much for delivering an excellent course. I was having difficulty in retaining material I had studied. I mentioned my problem to a good friend and he suggested 'Learning How To Learn.' I now have invaluable techniques for life. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and I have recommended it to some friends.Kindest regards,Richard Mongey
This course was quite insightful and well-balanced. I think the best indication of its good quality is that you can see some of the concepts they are presenting in this course being incorporated in it, which brings you one step closer to using those in your life because you've tried them and you know they're really working. Thanks for all the wonderful materials!
IT IS REALLY USEFUL COURSE FOR THE TEACHERS AND INSTRUCTORS. IT IS ALSO A GOOD PLATFORM FOR THE LISTENING STUDENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ISSUING THE CERTIFICATE FOR THIS COURSE. I HAVE COMPLETED THE 'SPEAK
ENGLISH PROFESSIONALLY: IN PERSON, ONLINE & ON THE PHONE'. AND I HAVE APPLIED THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION ALSO. SO KINDLY ISSUE ME THE CERTIFICATE PLEASE.
Useful and well presented.Well presented: The teachers of this course clearly have taken a lot of time to lay out and present the material in a clear and accessible way. Thanks!!Useful: should've learned this stuff 30 years ago. It'd have made my learning process much more efficient and effective. Ah well - at least I can use it in the upcoming 50 years still :-)
An absolutely brilliant course. I recommend it to anyone that's ever been interested in understanding how to learn things. Examples, tools and techniques in the course are applicable in real life and something you might find yourself using more than you thought you would. I definitely learned a lot from this course and so would you if you took it. Happy learning!
I applied it to my work, the principles really worked for me, key topics that I've learned: pomodoro technique, how to use focused mode when studying, train your brain to fight procrastination, focus on the process, not on the product and most importantly don't fool yourself. I want to thank all the professors and professional that made this life-changing course.
A course that all students should take to gain or remind themselves of important learning and retention techniques. Too often, I find myself and others studying for an objective (like grade) rather than actually learning the material. The only critique I have is that the course feels a bit old fashioned. A more modern remake would improve it but is not necessary.
I was very impressed with the content of this course.  Not only was the information within your course/ frequent mini tests great but the optional videos featuring greats from around the world were enlightening.  Thank you!  From this day forward I will look at learning completely different.  I appreciate you giving me the tools to help me become more successful.
This course is distinguished and much helpful for me to keep control my self and conquer the procrastination in learning difficult courses or  tasks. The teachers give us both nearest neural research results and fruitful, easy-understanding examples. Moreover, retrieval quiz after every week study makes me focus on the keynotes. Thanks for keep me in perspective!
This class was extremely helpful with teaching some of the most basic learning skills we never learned growing up. We've all been put in school and told to go learn but we were never taught how to learn! Thanks to both the professors avid input and tips on tackling tough material, I now feel much more confident heading into any type of course of program of study.
With each new week I am consistently impressed with the content, thoroughness and thoughtfulness behind each lecture video, additional material and quiz.  This is invaluable, and easily applicable material that I wish I had learnt when I was a college freshman.. Better late than never I suppose. Thank You Barbara and co for putting this excellent course together.
This is a brilliant course no matter what stage you're at in your learning experience or what age you are. It strengthens key learning techniques, gives you new techniques to learn better and to overcome certain fears and anxiety associated with learning and finally also debunks certain wrong beliefs or learning methodologies that lead to illusion of competence.
The knowledge and techniques are very helpful for me to review my conditions and performance. It gives a scientific point of view and well explained what's going on with both your mental and physical conditions. This course should be strongly suggested those who would like to learn effectively. Thanks for the instructors Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. Great work!
I think this is not only the most exceting course when you are taking it but also the most important course because It prepares and equipes you to learn any kind of courses or disciplines without fustracting and content yourself to apply the techniques and tools found by experts!!I can garantuee your success in your learning journey after finishing this course!!
A really important course for everyone to take. It was really lovely to finally have formal instruction how to learn. I know for a fact that I could re-take this course several times and still learn a tonne from it, a course like this can be a game changer, of course of the lessons learned from it are applied to ones academic or non academic learning endeavours.
I have loved this course. It is a very useful lecture where I have learn how to improve dramatically the way I was studying English language. The "Pomodore" technic, and the app Barbara spoke answering to a student, is very useful. besides, following what I learned in this course I have increased the amount of hours and I am much more focused in what I am doing.
Honestly, I think that this is such a powerful, useful, and beneficial course to take! It really does open your mind and educate you about how to properly learn. They do not only teach you about what you might be doing wrong, but they provide you with solutions and techniques to correct the way you learn! It is such an easy course and I definitely recommend it!
Great course for creating a solid mental model on learning how to learn. I am learning how to program, and never got a good education in how to learn math and science topics. I thought the course was great in explaining concepts in an unfolding way that allowed me to remember what was taught. I also appreciated the book recommendations, articles and interviews.
I think, it's a "must have" course for everyone, the sooner the better. So many researches and books behind it, but simple and clear language in the course. Really helped me to understand and avoid procrastination among many other insightful things. I've recommended this course to everyone of my friends and explained it to my kid. You should try it, believe me.
This course was designed near to perfection . Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Sejnowski did a wonderful job.I liked the optional interviews a lot and learned from the insights of special achievers in their field.I liked the idea of writing essays on our plan of using this knowledge for our own  and for teaching  others what we have learned , fascinating and rewarding.
Extremely useful course. It not only helped me to learn scientifically-proven strategies of learning, but also inspired me to rethink my learning goals and highlighted areas I have either never thought of, or abandonend, thinking that it will take me more of resourses to master it, than I have; however now I'm positively sure that I can get back to my old goals
I will continue to revisit the course material for years now, I hung in there and it just kept getting better and better, and I can't thank coursera enough for the financial aid they gave me to complete this course with proper certification. I totally enjoyed this course. Now going for some technical ones where I can apply the techniques learned in this course.
Along with the Learning How to Learn, there are many other things to learn. About how the professors have worked so indepth on the concept, how it is presented to effectively, little and major things that has effected the professors life (As it would for life of passionate people) and many more. Happy to take this course! Thanks a lot for providing this to us.
This is great course and I recommend it for all genders and ages. Be aware of new perspective and insights of how be a better student, teacher, self educator. The learning techniques you master throughout this course can be applied in all facet of your life both personally as well as professionally. A day without a new thing learnt is lost so keep on learning.
I have learned so much about how to learn efficiently and effectively in just a short space of time. This course is laden with practical ways that you can use right away! I have been glued to this course not only because I find the material am learning is very useful but also because of Barbara's soothing voice and charming presentation. She's simply amazing!!
Amazingly insightful, lucid and transformation=al experience. Thank you so much - Midway in the course, I paused to complete reading the book - A mind for numbers and then resumed the course, I feel truly rewarded about the time spent on the course as well as reading the book. Indeed indebted for this wonderful treatise. sincerely & with gratitude Shyam Sharma
Learning How To Learn is a great course to start your Coursera journey. Extensive information on how to learn in easy bite-sized videos that make it easy to keep up the weekly deadlines. The instructors cover a lot of basic learning skills. I wish I had taken this course before I graduated. It would've made it much easier how to learn. Compliments to the team.
I thoroughly enjoyed this courses. The lectures were insightful and well presented. I am currently employing some of the techniques that I have learned. I struggle with procrastination, and the idea of focusing on the process and not the product is helping me to get tasks completed, when I previously procrastinated. I think every student should do this course.
Fantastic course, for me the first one at Coursera and it was definitely more valuable than I expected. They not only give you insights of learning and several functions of the brain, they also give you concreet tools to use right away. I am sure all the things I have learned in this course are applicable for every one, despite age or background.Regards,Thomas
This is an excellent course. I was having difficulty controlling procrastination and my academic performance was terrible before this course. But now even though I haven't finished yet, I'm able to control procrastination and my productivity soared and it has in turn increased my self-confidence. A million thanks to all those involved in preparing this course!
Brilliant, both the lecturers were very engaging and teaching the subject with passion. Now I realize that I should have done this course 20 years before. But having said, I am fortunate to come across this material and do the course. I love it and strongly recommend to young learners and of course all levels and age of learners. Keep learning - How to Learn.
Great introduction into getting back into the studying and learning mode. I have been out of school for over 25 years. This course has shown me what steps, skills and methods I need to apply to allow me to start learning again. It corrected alot of my bad habits and showed me what I was doing wrong. I wish I would have had this course in my high school years.
this course has changed my view on "Learning". The tools, the techniques, the methods are given by Professor Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley are so effective that I could see the difference in my approach to a subject within days of enrolling myself in the course. Now I am able to approach a new subject with a new perspective and think  "out of the Box"
This is arguably the most important course in our modern day where self-learning is necessary to keep up and adapt to all the changes taking place. This course will give you clarity on your learning abilities and guide you in transforming how you approach learning. Very grateful to both Dr. Oakley & Dr. Sejnowski and all their guests for the amazing insights.
I enjoyed the class so much, I purchased Dr. Oakley's book and signed onto the follow-up course! In this course, I discovered key ways the mind works in relation to learning and how to use those aspects to my advantage. I'm no stranger to learning, but it was revealing to discover how to learn in better, more efficient ways than I have in the past. Thank you!
It was quite an interesting endeavor going through this course with all the neurological and psychological insights about learning process , how to tackle procrastination , good study habits , and other mental tools that worked well for me , If you struggle keeping your mind on the material you try to master I highly recommend this course . " Happy Learning "
I've learned a lot from this course. After I took this course I found out that I was using wrong way to study in the entire college life. But now I can use the new technique to recall what I have learned before and sth new in the future. Thanks to professor Barbara Oakley. She has change my learning method and attitude toward new thing in the rest of my life.
I am approaching the end of PhD study. But I still think this is the best course I ever take in my life. I think it completely changed my life. Thanks so very much for sharing such important knowledge! I wish I had this class 10 years ago. It would definitely make my student career easier.  However, it is still not too late. I highly recommend it to everyone.
This incredible course provides a glimpse into the neurological processes that take place when learning something new, and offers many effective strategies that can be used to become a better learner. As both a student and an educator, I feel like the knowledge I have gained through Barbara and Terry's lectures will be very useful to me in my future pursuits.
It's one of the best courses I've ever done! I'm really enjoying doing it. It's really well-thought and well-structured. I love every minute of it and I feel like I really analyse and learn something new. Huge thank you to the creators of the course and Barabara in paricular for beeing such an inspired and inspiring speaker. You are emazing! Thank you angain!
This is a well designed course.  The presentations of Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are clear, precise and interesting.  The tests and exercises help me further understand every main concept of learning how to learn.  This course inspires me and reconfirms that everyone has the ability to learn new things when you use the right techniques.  Thank you very much.
I love to learn and that course is very interesting. I have found smart tools, good techniques and the teachers are very easy to understand : english is not my mother language but a didn't feel difficulties to catch the lessons. It's the first time i try to go through a mooc in English and it was very excinting ! Thanks for everything and good learning !! ;D
Mi first thought was “yeah, right. Another quick bunch of tips for studying”.SO WRONG! This course has changed my whole perception on pretty much everything I read and learn everyday. Until now I was convinced I was the “type of person” who couldn’t learn and keep knowledge. One of the best gifts I’ve given myself until now is take the time for this course.
Enlightening ! How I wish I could turn back the time to my childhood days when I was young. It could have helped me to learn/study better, the frustrations, guilt and self-blame for not doing well at school.  Thanks for offering the course at no cost for I have benefitted alot from it.My heartfelt thanks to Barbara, Terry and the Learning How to Learn Team.
This is the best! Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski made a very valuable course on improving your learning: practical, good insights, lots of mini-testing. This is the decade of 'lifelong learning': better get prepared well. For me, this course made me really go a step further. Thanks a lot 'Barb' and Terry. Without doubt... I highly recommend this course!
This is a great course to understand the mechanisms of learning and how to get out the most of them. I wish this course was taught at college as in my opinion is very valuable to understand the underlying processes and caveats in learning. I wish I took it earlier! Highly recommended as the teachers are very knowledgeable and the material is well presented.
Excellent ways discussed for helping to improve one's learning abilities. A must attend course for anyone interested in knowing how to hone mental faculties, whatever the discipline being learnt. My sincere thanks to Coursera, and the instructors - Prof. Barbara and Dr. Terrence and their team for putting up such a fantastic course for the masses at large!!
I found this course to be excellent for giving me the confidence to get back into learning.  I'm now looking into courses that will help me change direction to a more fulfilling career.  It's helped me realise some important life rules: procrastination is not my friend and the pomorodo technique can be applied to pretty much anything - especially housework!
This course is simply amazing! It's well-structured and explains learning in simple, accessible ways. I've learned so much about learning, and realised that many things I used to do were wrong. You can get hands-on and actively change how you learn, bit by bit, as you go through the course. Barb and Terry's voices gave me a lot of confidence in myself, too!
This is really "powerful" information that anyone would benefit from learning.  I would love to see this type of education become part of the fundamentals that students learn in high school and college.  The instructors are easy to understand and it is taught in digestible pieces.  I loved this course and will recommend it to my co-workers.  Excellent job!
It seems I was looking for some course like this through all my conscience life. Many advises and techniques seemed to be so obvious and simple, but I found myself ignoring them every time. So now I know they are explained scientifically and working in practise. My conclusion - learning how to learn is the first thing we have to learn! Thank you very much!
I found the course interesting and at times enlightening (the illusion of knowledge is one of my big problems, as well as procrastination) I am a middle-aged woman and I take care of school and how much I learned is very useful to work better with the boys.. Thank you on behalf of my school !!after this course  i promise to learning how to learn english ;)
Very helpful information & well presented! This is a course is grounded in rigorous neurobiology, but is presented in a very practical, applicable, and engaging way. While the course is geared towards students, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to learn new skills or tackle procrastination in their personal/professional life.
One of the best courses I have taken so far. I didn't need to write many things down, because there were so many small quizzes that helped me remember the key points. It was very well presented and there were no fluff videos to waste time or bulk up the content. Everything made sense and all the steps are ones that I can and will add to my new study style.
The presentation of the course is a perfect example of how to engage students' focus and clearly present the subject one is teaching. This in itself is perhaps the best testimony to the fact that the course teachers truly appreciate the subject they are discussing.I recommend this course to everyone I know. Learners and teachers alike will benefit from it.
There is not really much to talk about this course. If you have any problems with learning, or you believe your methods of learning are not efficient enough, this course is the best option for you. It will definitely change your way of thinking about learning, and it will provide you the awesome tips and facts about learning. At least it helped me. A LOT!!
A powerful toolbox for learning and for empowering your life. I have started to put a lot of simply exercises and techniques taking from this course into my real life, day to day, not only for learning but also for working and I have gained confidence in my learning skills after some years. Incredible course, totally recommendable for everybody at any age!
Dr. Barbara Oakley is a witty and good teacher, she made the course easy to learn and enjoyable. Learnt new tips on learning how to learn which i will definitely apply to my learning process. A real eye opener to concepts i have never heard of before. It also solidified some of my beliefs with regards to learning such as having adequate rest and exercise.
Excellent course, changed my perception of learning and now I am looking at learning through new lens. Excellent material and useful after videos equally supplement the training making it an intriguing experience. Although I am not a student but that doesn’t stop me from taking this course and it’s a must read for anyone irrespective of his phase of life.
It was a fun and insightful class. There were many unhealthy study-practices that I realized I had, and the class introduced some more effective alternatives. I am still trying to find the best system that works for me, and an equivalent of a memory palace for my mind-blind brain( since I am an Aphant). Thank you so much for providing us with this course!
Very interesting course with numerous details from scientific studies, interviews and demonstrations that are quite impressive. I have learned a lot about how I can memorize and retain information that I need to learn a language or even remember basic things on a daily basis. I recommend this course, it's not a long course and it gives you a lot for free.
Before I was facing the problem of learning how to learn and understand things, now after taking this course and the techniques taught in this course are so awesome. Everyone should take this course and follow exactly what been told and implement it and see how the results will be.Thanks to the Instructors and Coursera Community for this WONDERFUL Course.
This course taught me knew concepts about the relationship between my 
brain and learning, that I can use to better my career.   I have a 
Master's degree in engineering and am on my second career and still 
found the information very useful.  I appreciate that the concepts are 
based on academic research, and that this is not a gimmick or set of 
tricks.
As a University student who has failed courses in the past; this MOOC was extremely helpful in leading me to understand exactly what I was doing wrong when studying. Furthermore, the Instructors provide you with methods to improve your studying once you have discovered what you're doing wrong, thus the course sets one the correct path to learn and succeed
Excellent course. The course material justifies the title very well as it is package of tools for boosting creativity and effective learnin. In addition, the element of fun in quizzes keeps one motivated and happy throughout the course. I strongly recommend everyone that please take sometime out and first learn How to Learn before learning anymore things.
The subject of the course is extremely interesting and useful for learners.  On the presentation front, I feel it could make better use of technology (some PP slides, more colorful examples), it effectively provides the students with some very important concepts and techniques to improve the process of learning.  Therefore, I still give it a 5star rating!
The course is a well presented material on how your mind works and how to take control of your learning process, not only during academic years, but for the entirety of your life. I, heartly, recommend this course for anyone that has problems procrastinating, feeling insecure about their own intelligence or simply wants to become a more efficient learner.
Very helpfull course! A bit dry (or is that just a Dutch phrase?), but good information. Learned a lot about my learning in the past and why certain things worked and others didn't. It will make my learning in the future most certainly more easy. I can't believe there is no course like this in highschool and universities (at least not in The Netherlands).
This course was absolut amazing, starting with the people, the structure of it, the way they talk in a calm a gentle way and the amount of information that is given to you, just to feed a curiosity to learn more about the particular topic. I wish my teacher in faculty would be more like them or at least try to give us the information in a structured way.
Impressively designed and presented. The small tests and the repetitions, offset in time and context, were in the spirit of what was taught. I really liked the dynamic marking of the text parallel to the video. The large selection of (language) subtitles is also impressive. The "illusion of presence" was also very good.You deserve all 5 stars. Thank you.
Excellent CourseEasy to follow content and explanations backed up by extensive literature (from day to day to very deep cientific articles)I wish I had taken this course when I was in college - re-reading was by far the method I used for testing and learning - never heard of recalling before. Very pleased to have learned something new, among other stuff.
I really enjoyed this course. The information was given in an easy to understand way. The additional reading materials were really useful as well. I fount several useful techniques for improving my study-habits and it inspired me to take another look at maths and science. I recommend this course for anyone looking for inspiration and/or self-development.
This is a "first class course" I recommend anybody to take irrespective of their educational level and credentials. I have had fun all the way from start to end. I am already teaching my 8 year daughter what I learned. She is very very happy too. Barbara and Terrence, good job and thank you very much. Fernando Marcelo Landaburu in Buenos Aires, Argentina
I didn't expect much from this course but how much that was blown out of the water! From the start this course showed me areas to enhance my former methods of learning (which was insufficient). Especially the aspect on what cramming produces and what is truly needed to become a lifelong learner. I will recommend this course for anyone studying ANY field!
This course has much similarity to the book "A Mind For Numbers", but in this course there are some valuable interviews in which experts in different areas share their learning methods. Both the lecture and the book revealed interesting knowledge about our brains and provides intructions on how to use it correctly. Overall, it's a lesson worth listening.
I am a 2015 college pass out student ,worked in IT field for 1.5years and now planning to learn new technologies to take a new step in my career. I am thankful for the 'Learning How to Learn Team' for the tips and encouragement that you have given me to make a first step. Will keep in my mind and work on those tips in my future learning .Thank you Team..
This is a fantastic course, plenty of additional features besides the course are offered! The instructors keep the material interesting and informative.   This course provides interview with skilled learners and people who have used learning tools to achieve success in their career.  This course is great for ADHD people, I am ADHD myself. Happy learning!
I  found it extremely interesting  and useful. It is a compact course but has given  great  mental tools to help in learning.The list of  optional readings is helpful in  getting a deeper understanding. I feel quizzes could have been a little more challenging. I really enjoyed the videos and from them have  learnt how to deliver a video lecture.Thank you
This was an excellent course. The lessons were easy to follow and they used a plethora of techniques that they were teaching to make the concepts easily understandable. The course taught me techniques about learning which makes acquiring any future knowledge much easier. I wish I had known these methods sooner. The tests should have been harder, though.
Thank you for such an exciting learning experience. I now have a better understanding of the challenges  experienced through my life with learning.  I have gained, through this course, a better understanding of how the brain functions and how simply I am able to tap into these basic fundamentals of learning to make a difference. This material is golden!
All the things that are mentioned in the course are helpful for anyone who want to learn new skills effectively, who thinks that they don't have what it takes to learn any difficult subjects. I wish I knew these teachings before when I was school or college, but now I know it and I'm certainly gonna take it in use. Do give it a try, you won't regret it.
This course is really good. It explains how our brain works, how we can deal with procrastination, how to change a habit, what happens in our brains when we learn something new, what we should do to really learn and what to avoid.I highly recommend this course for everybody who wants to understand how our brain works and how we can develop ourselves. :)
This was an eye opening course for me.  I learned a lot of new tools and concepts and a whole new way to approach learning.  I wish this had been available to me when I was a student but I feel it has tremendous value for anyone who wants to learn something new.  The instructors were great and presented the material in an easy to understand and fun way.
This course has been immensely useful in identifying the mistakes I was making in learning new things. I have been able to understand why even after putting in a lot of effort my grasp of concepts remained brittle and prone to be forgotten when recalling after some time. This is a must take course for anyone who like me is struggling to master concepts.
Great course on learning. In here, you will learn about how the brain works and with that knowledge, you'll learn to make the most efficient use of it. The instructors are good and the videos have a lot of visual aids to help. This is one of the first online courses I took and I believe I learned as much as if I was in a classroom with the instructors.
It has been a long time since doing any sort of online learning/ training and this was the perfect start back into it. Barbara and Terrence perfectly breakdown segments of information and make the learning process seem more understandable and manageable. I can't wait to take the skills I have learned in this course to make the most out of the next one!
This course was eye opening in terms of giving more new tools to utilize as I finish my last semester and take this new found knowledge into my daily job. Some of the techniques I had already learned on my own but most of them were very new to me! I definitely think this is a worth while course, if you have the time please I insist you try and take it!
A lot of people mention that they don't remember the things in high school due to the fact that they just purely relied on memorization. This course is essential to learning information to prepare you for future courses and life tasks. Stop relying on memorization and start recalling the information and putting your knowledge through quizzes and tests.
The class was well paced well and interesting.  I  developed skills that I wish I had learned in high school :-). I gained great insight into how we learn and was able to apply what I learned everyday.  I found myself constantly sharing the information and tips I learned with family and friends and really getting excited while talking about the course.
Hello, I met here some extraordinary people. The course was very exciting, intriguing and remarcable concise. As a lecturer (with a degree in Civil Engineering) I found this course very useful for my futures lessons, the way of learning that is taught here is fitting like a glove. I feel that I have improved my way of thinking and I thank you for that.
I learned many new techniques on how to effectively learn new things, the Pomodoro technique,  recall practice, using metaphor and analogies, team learning, and many others.  These can also be used to retain and better understand already learned material.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone and will be sharing it with my family and friends.
One of the best courses on the internet. They should teach a simplified version of this from grade 1. If we somehow manage to include the topics mentioned in this course for kids, I truly believe we will be able to change the lives of everyone on the planet. If we are lucky we will also be able to save the planet before we reach the point of no return.
Oakley (with support from other researchers) provides some handy study tools in this healthy guide to good study habits. The lectures are accessible to any learning level---middle-schoolers to graduate students. The lectures and quizzes reinforce material from her book. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to get the most out of their study time.
I wish I had this course before I started college. I'm pretty sure at one point or another I did everything exactly opposite of what this course teaches. I often crammed, did not study effectively, and definitely fooled myself on multiple occasions of thinking I understood material. Everyone who is serious about learning better should take this course.
This course has taught me  the key points and methods to improve the learning processes more effectively and efficiency.  There are plenty of helpful hits, skills and strategies for gaining better performance in the my study processes.  Now I have more understanding the factors of successfully learning and being more concentrate in new things learning.
It is a great course! I am learning this at the age of 54. I wish I would have got this course or the teachers when I was in school or college. no doubt this course is backed by scientific research in this area. thank you Coursera team for bringing out this course. Thank you, Prof. DR. BARBARA
  OAKLEY  & DR.
TERRENCE SEJNOWSKI for inspiring teaching.
I want to recommend this course because my experience was gratifying. I have learning problems such as dyslexia and Disorder Attention Disorder, for this reason, it is very important for me to learn a correct and adequate way of studying. I am very satisfied with what I learned in this course and I am sure that it will be something useful all my life.
An eye-opening course that gives you the confidence to approach learning on almost anything. Even if many ideas presented in this course are intuitive, for example using recall to make sure information is persisted in your memory, you will gain more self-awareness in the process of studying/working and you can start applying the knowledge to yourself.
I guess I didn't want it to end because I kept extending the deadline. I wanted it to keep going and giving things to think about and learn.  I am still processing everything, but I see myself using this information for myself and in my somewhat new career as an ESL teacher. Many thanks for everyone that made this course happen and made it so coooool!
Excellent overview, great simple, relaxing presentation and important content. I would love a class that focused more on the neuroscience and hard biology of the topic of effective learning and retention. A video concentrating on tactics for unlearning incorrectly learned facts and habits and reducing Einstellung will improve the course in my opinion.
Wow this course has seriously helped me open my mind on how I learn things. So many true things in this course that I experienced and now know why. I'm pumped for my future. I want to learn everything even things outside my possible career choices. With these tools I can truly break the barriers of learning. Break old habits and teach myself new ones.
I love this course. When I am starting to struggle in a class and cannot figure out what I am doing wrong I always come back to this course to review. Barbara Oakley you are an amazing person and you encouraged me to give collage another try despite my learning disabilities. Thank you, and thank you to everyone else who make this course possible. Troy
This is a very useful course in understanding the learning process. You get to learn about the what happens inside your brain when we try to learn a new thing, how it is moved into your long term memory.I found the simple tools and techniques like pomodoro, testing breaks very useful.Thanks a lot! ..... to the UC team for making this course available.
I'm just one week away of finishing this course, but I can already tell that is been the most effective learning course I ever take. The technique I already learn have been of so much help in the resent days of my life. even if it work or studies or simple life, everything you'll learn in this course will help you to improve your skills and abilities.
This is one of the most powerful courses I completed. It practically changed the way I look at learning and has kindled in me a fire for life long learning.  Thanks a lot Barbara and Terrence Sejnowski for putting together this incredible course for the benefit of one and all.  This act of yours is life changing for people like me. Thanks once again.
I learned a lot and really good and valuable helping techniques from this course, It would have been much more beneficial if I could have know this course much earlier part of my life.  As said nothing is late if we can use the benefits of this course in my horning courses that I have planned in my mid carrier life.Thank you!Best Regards,Venkatesan.R
This is a wonderful course. Everyone who is interested to improve their learning should take this asap. During studying this course often I wondered why there was no course like this during my school/college days. Better late than never for me :). Do take this course. Thanks a lot to the course creators for creating this superb, very relevant course.
A doorway to understanding your mind from the learning perspective. I do not think that this course is only for students who are trying to acquire new knowledge but this course is for everyone who understands the value of learning new knowledge in our personal and professional lives. In general this course is a must for people from all walks of life.
In just 4 quick weeks the course provides techniques, explanations and encouragement to improve in your intellectual development. The mandatory content of the course is only around 8-10h of videos. That is much less than binge-watching a season of your favorite show on Netflix. Make yourself the gift of going through this course. You won't regret it.
I would recommend this course to everyone including working professionals. This course is not limited only to learners of a course of studies. The concepts are extremely useful and I already see terrific self-improvement in my work and learning. Thanks to Coursera for hosting such a wonderful course. Last, but not the least the trainers were awesome.
This should be taught to everyone at High school. I believe I learnt a lesson not only about my capability to learn anything I want, but a lesson that can easily be transferred to many areas of my life. Thanks coursera! I am finding ways to share the principles with my students ... its the least I could do to give someone a chance to succeed in life.
Learn How To Learn is a very awesome MOOC, that contributes to enhancing skills to learn in a more natural way, whatever wanted to learn. It made a bridge between the scientific finds and the normal human being like those of society, whose, ultimately, should always be the goal of any scientific research worldwide.Paulo Verlaine B. e Azevêdo, Brazil.
Short, easy to digest and although much of the information was known to me in some form or another, it is still very helpful to gain understanding as to why I show certain behaviour. I wish I had known about this when doing my degrees, as I am sure I would have had done a better job of engraining much of what I have learned into my long term memory.
My only disappointment with this course is that I haven't take it prior to enter University. I feel like my studies would have been much more efficient and I would have retained much more knowledge from the classes and books! Anyway, this is a wonderful course that has taught me a lot about I could improve my studies and be much better at my career.
This is a great course and I wish something like that was taught in universities, better yet in schools. In fact, I think it's embarrassing that learning techniques aren't a part of official education. The course is presented very well and has tonnes of very useful information for anyone who's trying to overcome procrastination and learn new skills.
This is a really good course. I'm over 50 years old now, with a successful career in science and IT, but even so I wish someone had sat me down when I first started studying and given me these tools. They are non-intuitive but very effective, and I really appreciate the effort from the instructors in passing on this life-changing knowledge for free.
This course should be absolutely mandatory for students looking to further their education past Middle School. The professors present sound and earnest methods of using one's entire mind to his or her advantage. We even learn how to use our disadvantages to our advantage! This is simply a perfect course for learning the finer points of how to learn.
It was very informative and really helpful. I am a serial procrastinator and I found techniques to tackle procrastination very effective. I'm going to apply those techniques in my life. Moreover, I found the teachers very good in explaining the concepts. I would love to see them teaching more courses here. Thank you for designing such a cool course!
Excellent course, a 'must' for students or anyone attempting to learn and retain information. I recommend the course and the book, A Mind for Numbers, to students routinely and use some of the information in workshops on study skills and test-taking. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn and retain information more effectively.
It is a great course esp for aspiring students, teachers (who in turn can teach their students) and parents. I wish these things are imparted and drilled in students at a much earlier age. I knew most of these things but by accident and over a long period of time. Brilliant course - you can even download or see all videos in 1 go like a documentary.
Taking this course (before you take courses in the subject matter that interest you) is a no brainer!  I took this course to ensure that I got the most out of the online courses I wanted to take.  The concepts and tips presented were easy to grasp and apply.  I think this course will have a big impact on my ability to learn and retain new material.
This is an excellent course especially those aspiring to learn more materials. The instructor is knowledgeable and used various forms of teaching styles. She has several interviews with renowned personalities, recommends reading valuable texts by very credible authors. I enjoyed my learning. I would want to develop my class like this in the future.
Amazing course. I'm not currently studying for tests or a degree but found the neuroscientific background and learning strategies extremely interesting and helpful for all kinds of situations where we grapple with new information. And I particularly love the references and further reading suggestions that accompany each module for future reference.
Whether you are a student in a school or in a college, in my opinion, we all are students in this life. To continue producing creative solutions, we need to stay in connection with ourselves by learning. Learning How to Learn has immensely widened my horizons on how capable a human being is towards his/her mental abilities. Totally recommending it!
This course though light and breezy is full of very useful and surprising insights into how the brain works and how we can use simple practical techniques to learn and understand things better.This course is suitable for all branches of study, academic, non-academic.I highly recommend this course and also Barbara Oakley's book, 'A Mind For Numbers'
Very helpful and approachable. The book is an excellent complement to the course (not surprising since the course is based on the book). ("A Mind For Numbers" is the book title).It is worth reviewing the course materials periodically (better: build your own spaced repetition flash cards!) because it's information you'll want to hang on to for life!
This is one of the best course I have ever taken, maybe I have taken this course when I was a kid so I had not to struggle this much to learn. It tells me how to control procrastination, how memory works, how to think, how to learn, How exercise contributes to our learning and much more. Course has ended but I would always be a part of this course.
I loved this course and keep referring to it in conversations with friends and work colleagues.  I could not possibly say (sing?) enough praise about it.  This course got me to start studying the German language again and relit the desire to finally finish that last research paper needed to complete my degree in Anthropology.  Thank you, thank you!
I have been only into the preview week and the course is amazing. It has given me amazing insights and helped me understand my thinking patterns. Now I understand why my brain thinks the way it thinks. The rest 4 days have been wonderful. I am able to take control of my thought pattern and learn a lot. Looking forward to the complete course. Thanks
I found the Course to be useful to me to Learn How to Learn. It helps me to plan, take actions, learn new things and subjects and to practice new things, to relate new things with old and to teach others how to learn.  I am thankful to Dr. Barbara and Dr. Tserovoski for preparing and delivering the course professionally.  Warm Regards Viren Sharma
I found this course as eye opener, so practical and made me realize very valuable things for me which I will be able to use/have started using to improve my learnings. I have also shared with colleagues of mine at my workplace the information about the course as well as some techniques which can be immediately utilized such as Pomodoro. Thank you!
It is an excellent on line course. When I read ` Mind Shift` by Dr Barbara OaKley,I never thought that it would be that interesting and useful. I wish it continued for more weeks. Personally,I got the answers to my searches through this wonderful process of learning. I strongly recommend people to go through this course and enjoy further learning.
It is a great course which outlines different techniques which will help you learn more effectively. It also explains the functioning of the brain with regard to learning in easy to understand and fun ways. The course also helps you in dealing with procrastination. I loved the course and would highly recommend it. Thank you Coursera and Team LHTL!
Excellent course that improved my approach to learning. When thinking of the fact how many people around the world are taking this course, it is fair to say that this course has the potential to improve the lives of hundred of thousands of people.I wish to express my special gratitude to Barbara Oakley: Your course makes this world a better place!
Excellent course to take. It helped me to understand what I was missing in doing effective learning. There are so many strategies to use that student should know. The teachers are very clear in explaining the topics. I recommend this course to everyone no matter what the age is. Thanks so much I really enjoyed it a lot as well as learned so much.
Absolutely excellent course!! I was struggling with procrastination and wandering if there was any "Learning Training" program that could help me. This course has really made an impact on my life, not only in academics. It really is a coaching program to become a skillful and precise learner. I absolutely recommend it, for me it's a total must!!!
Really very useful, well-presented, easy to understand course with great tips for anybody who is interested in learning anything. Lots of great videos from experts in their own fields involving learning languages, memory techniques and other areas. Something for everyone - there's no reason not to be a better learner after completing this course!
I really love the point of imposter which makes me realize that it is common for everyone so that I can feel free to be confident. And I love the part of the optional interview which inspires me a lot and give new perspectives from different experts in different fields. Thank you very much for the course and I will apply what I learnt in my life.
The course provided some very useful learning techniques, along with a context of why they work. I enjoyed the optional interviews - some of them were especially motivating. The wonderful thing about the course it that one could do the quizzed even when only auditing the course. This helped me understand and remember the main ideas of the videos.
Great ideas accompanied by useful tools and resources.  The supplementary interviews are often interesting and the reading lists offer a great way to look into the research grounding the course more carefully.  Toward the final week or two of the course, the organization gets a little mushier and the lessons can feel a bit more like a 'grab bag.'
This course was wonderful and the lessons will stick with me for a lifetime. The course itself  was well designed and the summary questions and weekly quizzes effectively reinforced what was taught in the videos. I read Barbara's companion book "A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel At Math and Science" as I took the course. Each reinforced the other.
Awesome techniques that will follow and guide you not only throughout your academic years, but in every aspect of your life as well. You´ll cover topics such as procrastination and neuroscience, not to mention several practical techniques to enhance your learning. I am glad I did this course and I have already recommend it to friends and family.
In this wonderful course you will find the answers you have asked yourself in relation to learning. You will learn how your brain works in order to learn, how to fight procrastination and how to have productive study sessions. A big applause to Drs. Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for making this course enjoyable, interesting, useful and fun!
This would surely go down as one of the most important course of my life. Learning How to Learn delivers the goods at the right pace while leaving a positive indelible mark on well, learning how to learn. Many of these techniques and approach will be useful for my future endeavours, be it studying another course or applied in daily work matters.
It's a well-structured course which teaches you a lot of things. Even if you are using some of the mentioned techniques, you will find a good category for best-practised learning methods and some meetings with bright people from all over the world. I highly recommend it and don't cram it, apply deliberate practice to have the most benefit of it.
This course is very inspirational and useful with little workload and clear explanation, I recommend everyone taking this course. It may give you a brand new perspective about meta-learning. I also recommend you to view optional readings and interview videos to know how people echoed their experience with the tool kits introduced in this course.
6 months on and I am still using the tools learned in this course: Pomodoro, breaking up learning with a different activity, repetition, etc. This is a course I intend to review over and over again as it will serve a critical tool for lifelong learning. I believe it should be adapted into a Learning 101 program at the elementary education level.
I really enjoyed this course, the information provided was clear and to the point. My attention was held which i dont find many courses can. I will hopefully remember to put all these new learning's into practice in my everyday life. I very much appreciate the time and effort gone into making the course and sharing it with me.Thanks again Andrew
As a mental health professional I found this course beneficial in helping me prepare for a secondary graduate degree in neuroscience, and in the work with my clients!  The information in this course enabled me (and my clients) overcome obstacles that I didn't think I could.I highly recommend this course to laypeople and professionals alike.Gitty
This course returned the trust in myself to develop future skills, which I never plan to develop and more important - I stopped to afraid to take complicated courses to learn. This course should be in every school as the subject #1. Highly recommend to read the book of Barbara which will only strengthen the received knowledge. Thank you Barbara!
It has been one of the most useful courses for me. I had already tried some other approaches to improve my learning time and deal with procrastination, through an online material from Stanford, and some other time I tried using  pomodoro, but by itself it was not enough help.However, I find this course was the most useful and interesting for me.
Amazing. So much useful information, so well structures and presented and also keeping a young and happy spirit throughout the materials. (you will understand what I mean)This course is a really life changer and any person should take this. I warmly recomand to watch also the optional videos to learn from real life examples. Good luck and enjoy!
The material in this course was well laid out and presented in a simple yet effective fashion. I highly recommend this course for those who feel they struggle with studying, retaining new information, understanding new concepts, solving complex problems, struggle with test taking, or feel inadequate in their general area of studies or learning.
Sometimes we have knowledge that we can't tell where it is from, with this course i could organize and prepare even more for whatever i am studying. The feeling of accomplishment is filling me and since the start i've been sharing with workmates and family about learning how to learn.It is with grate joy that i rate this course with five stars.
A Wonderful course that really helped me learn a lot about the way we learn and how I can enhance my own learning. It made the entire process very fun and entertaining, which led me to have a greater interest in the subject! Both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are amazing teachers, who have truly made this a course worth viewing!
Even though it's been many years since I graduated from college, I found this course very helpful as a reminder on ways to learn effectively. I'm a dedicated life-long learner, and I've signed up for a master's level class at our local university for this upcoming fall semester. I feel this class will help me as I move forward in this endeavor.
It was a very engaging course that I just completed it without any pressure and also enjoyed the new techniques to learn ans master tough subjects not only in academics but also in Life. Barbara Oakley(the instructer) was so nice and educative that it was a fun during this course. Thank you coursera for Providing us this course . Thanks a lot!
An excellent and powerful MOOC, thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski your knowledge about this topic is simply amazing and marvelous!! I learned how to learn in a more productive way and how to use my time wiser,also I learned many things I didn't know about the brain and how it works. Thanks to both of you and thanks Coursera.
I've learned so much from this course. I've recently started implementing the tips and techniques taught in this course in my life and noticed that it has helped me a lot. My respect and gratitude to Dr.Barbara Oakley, Dr.Terrence Sejnowski, and the rest of the Learning How to Learn team for making this course accessible to everyone for free !
Powerful course, it made more aware of my problem with procrastination and taught me ways of fighting it. I wish I knew all these learning techniques from school, maybe my life would have been different now. I enjoyed very much the way Barbara Oakley presented this course, she is an amazing professor and such a sweet lady. Thank you very much!
This course helped me to understand how I can be more effective learning new things. What I learned in this course will help me my whole life in different aspects such as professional and personal ambits. I love to learn new things every day and now I will do it with quality, understanding how it works and using excellent techniques and tools.
I love the instructors and how committed they are to really help people, even going an extent of interviewing people who have had great achievements thus increasing motivation towards the learners to become better. I also love the fact that they are using metaphors and analogies that are quite helpful in the learning sessions. I enjoyed alot!
Great course!They give you a lot of tools for learning and against prograstination, most of them small and easy to apply. The most important underlying (neurological) concepts are explained in a way thats easy to understand and they provide a lot of interviews with interesting people about the material.Thanks for making this freely available!
This course is one of the few I've actively managed to complete thus far, simply because I used the techniques outlined in the very first week to carry me all the way through.  That should tell you how useful and valuable the information is, and how good of a teacher Barbera Oakley is.I'm also terrible at names, unless they're repeated often.
This course has been revolutionary for me for several reasons: 1. It helped me to realize there is value in online learning,  2. It fed my curiosity and inspired me, 3. It has just the right amount of theory and practical advise, 4. It has just enough depth to give a quick peek into the world of behavior for you to want to learn more. Thanks.
This is one of the rewarding courses. I highly recommend this course as it will add to both your professional and personal life. The information and techniques provided  will have a great impact on your life for years to come. I believe that starting with this course is a smart decision as it will be very beneficial in learning other courses.
Great course! I learned how to improve and enhance my memory and learning for future lessons. The material was well put together and practical for everyday learning. An amazing class and now I have skills that can help me for a life-time of learning like I have always desired. Very thankful I took this class! Short 4 weeks of amazing content.
this class is a must take for any life long learner.  There are always things you can be more mindful of when trying to pick up a new skill, and this goes deep into the psychology behind them.  I am now a more efficient learner, and have even used some of the insight from the class to help shape my personal life to be a more effective person.
In my view, this is very great source for everyone who wants to understand how our brain understand a particular topic, and how to get the most of it. After learning this, I get a much clearer picture about how our brain processes new ideas/concepts in our daily life. Definitely a must-have course for everyone striving for excellence in life!
I might not have participated in the course itself very much, but thanks to the e-mails from the LHTL team I am constantly abreast with their book recommendations, various and inspirational interviews and more. One day I will surely come back to the course and pay special attention to it! A great, I'd even say perspective-changing course! :-)
A brilliant course for people of all ages, lifelong learners. Kudos to Barbara and Terry and team for putting this course together. It is something that we think we know, but when you go through the course, many facts about learning are highlighted which are very important to know about learning and the process which are not taught in school!
I think the course is great as a practical guide to study with a flare of science. You won't be overwhelmed with scientific terms and results.  But the advices will always be nicely explained and based on research you can later look into deeper on your own. I was cautious about this course, but now, after completing it, I highly recommend it.
Honestly one of the best things I've done for myself in a long time. My thanks to professors Oakly and Sejnowski for their excellent presentation and consistent positive good will. The course will teach you a great deal about how to pursue your educational goals with strategic, reasoned methods.Thanks for this one, Coursera. I appreciate it.
A very powerful course to help students to do better to learn a skill or subject. This course is wonderfully oriented. It was enjoyable to watch and listen. I learned a lot from both professors. They are very talented and wise. Specially Miss Barbara is an excellent speaker. I hope everyone will do this course and get an idea about learning.
This course was amazing. In addition to teaching learning techniques, they also incorporated those techniques into teaching. The end result is that you learned how to learn even better. I recommend this course to anyone pursuing I.T certifications were you often learn to pass the exams.  But afterwards wondered where all that knowledge went.
This course should be taught to individuals pursuing a teaching credential. I wish I had this information when I began teaching 20 years ago. It would have been a benefit to my former students.  My current students have received valuable tips. They have been using the techniques over the last few weeks and are showing tremendous improvement.
This course helps all the things we have to do before start to study. The pomodoro technique is interesting, it helps to control the procrastination. I love the importance of the process, always think about it and don't think about the product. The mindset is important too. We have to win our fears and especially always believe in ourselves.
Hats off to a great and well-rounded course (my first here on Coursera) with wonderful mentors, interesting tasks, useful tricks and info for studying and test-taking, and more! I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their learning methods or skills in any field, and also to anyone who values life-long learning. Cheers!
Frankly speaking I didn't think there will be anything useful for me to learn, but in this case I am pleasantly surprised. Concentrated and easy to acquire knowledge of how to deal with certain issues, unleash cognitive powers of ones brain and overcome "inner" couch potato monster with few simple tricks - can't wait to put it into practice!
Highly rated course.This should be a basic learning for every student from about 12 to 77 years old at least. For youngers, it would be very intersting to adapt this course since it looks like it is not an option sor successful studies... Thank you very much to Barbara OAKLEY and other teachers.Thank you to San Diego University and Coursera.
I found every bit of content useful. I did this because I teach at a secondary school and wanted to check out how useful this course might be for my students. I'll be recommending that all of them do it.  One thing I would add is a topic on How students can help themselves find things out.  Too often, they just want to be spoon fed.  Thanks
Learned so many useful techniques and insights, easy trickes and tips, controlling anxiety, and more interesting info about how ou brains work. I really wished to came across this course before I finished all my school, university, and master courses(lol) but there yet so much to learn. Thank you so much. Just Start and you won't regret it.
This course is ideal!... for students,..... for first-time user of MOOC like coursera,... for people who want to acquire new skills / want to learn ... for enthusiats in neuroscience and and the brainBecause it is extremly well presented, it is fairly short - only 4 weeks and it provide instant tools and techniques of immediate application.
Thank I've understand a lot of different things that happened to me when I was in college and I was wondering how was possible, however I remember a similar course that was offered to me at first year of college I was thinking I supposed to   boring and not interesting. Now I'm sure how wrong I was.Thanks Barbara and the rest of the team!!!
This is one of the best course online - its a pre-course to all the MOOC learning we are going to do in future. Everyone who is thinking of learning and developing skills online as a part of their lives then they should start from this course. Both instructors are pretty cool and everything is explained in best possible way. 5 stars course.
It is an amazing course, which really helped me to learn better, easier and understand some processes such as diffuse and concentrated mode and others. Thank you for preparing it, it is really such a loss that students do not learn about it school or at the university... Anyway, I feel really grateful that I find out about it and enrolled!
Amazing course! I believe it should be teached in school. Although I'm not actively studying anywhere now, all information was actual and important! For example, I've learned how to form a new habits, tackle procrastination, how memory works and many-many other things. Thanks for teaching how to learn, Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski :)
I am very satisfied with this course because i learned a lot of techniques and modes which i can use to further improve my capacity to learn.I would also recommend this course to my friends as the techniques taught here are very valuable for life. Hats-off to Dr. Barbara and Dr.Terry for coming up with such a wonderful and flexible course.
Really helpful. Everyone who stuck by math or other tricky subject should take this course. Lots of strategies and tactics are taught through it and optional interview. The reference listed at the end of each lesson is very specific and in detail. You can practice each skill individually. What was once a trickle has since become  a stream!
Excellent course about learning and how your brain works. Definitely I'll try teach my 10 years old son techniques from this course and explain him all what I learned to help him make his life easier with learning. Knowledge is power and power is freedom.Thank you very much for opportunity to go through this course. You did great job guys.
thank you for making this available..  these contents must be used in induction courses at all graduate and undergraduate colleges.. it may improve the quality of efforts put in by students thereby improving the overall standard and ranking of a college or degree... colleges can atleast start experimenting this with some sections / batches
This course has given me super information on how to become a better learner.  Moreover, it has taught me that blindly following my passions isn't enough - I have to learn how to broaden them as well.  Equipped with many tips and tools, I now feel confident to face challenging subjects with excitement rather than dread. Highly recommended!
I have been out of school for about 5 years, and have been terrified of going back for a graduate degree because with work and a dissociative disorder, it is difficult to retain information. This program has given me tools to overcome that fear and an approach learning in a different way. I am so excited to earn this MS degree. Thank you!
This course has been a real eye opener in terms of the study methodology that one can adopt for optimized learning. The fact that process is more important than the product in achieving our learning goals, itself was a major shift in perspective for me. I look forward to attending future courses offered by Professors Oakley and Sejnowski.
It was a great experience. I ignored the way our brain works. Definitively it is an amazing organ. It was hard to realize that I was a procrastinator; now I understand  it, but the best thing is that I know how to deal with it. The pomodoro technique and the difuse thinking mode have helped me to asume leraning process in a different way.
This is a great course to provide you with a solid plan to lean and *retain* material in literally any subject or skill.  While the phrasing of several of the videos make it clear that it is aimed toward a student studying in a formal-educational setting, the material and information is broadly applicable any time.  13/10 would recommend.
As a Technology teacher, now retired, I told my students the content of what they learn in my courses changed from year to year but if they learned how to learn effectively then they would be successful in whatever direction their education lead them.  This course focuses on that goal and it should be a part of every students instruction.
Well structured, easy to move along. Reading the author's book, which is not required but compliments each other well. I learned a lot in this course. Planning to recommend this especially to college students. I wish it was available then. Even now, I'm planning to put more focus into the main ideas from the course to my future learnings!
Thank you very much, the authors of this course! First, to be honest, I thought the course will be boring, buy after first 2 or 3 lectures I was really into it!  I loved the short lectures, tips and tricks and the information how our brain works! I really enjoyed the time spend and definitely will use the tips for the learning! Thank you!
The course was very helpful in understanding the challenges that we face in learning new things and techniques to address and solve those challenges. The content and the instructors were engaging. Since I am no longer in school, the portion of module 4 on test taking wasn't relevant to me; however, I recommend this course to all learners.
Great Course .Well taught and researched and indeed the best on learning how to learn .Thanks A lot Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr .Terrence Sejnowski .Excellently Done Work .Having Done Mindshift Course too by the same team and having highly benefited so much ,I would be  earnestly looking forward to more courses and material from them soon .
It doesn't happen so often to feel sad when a course is over, I got incredibly excited about how prof Barbara and Terry took me in such an interesting section on neurosciences! It definitely changed my way to think about approaching to a new subject. Since learning doesn't stop at college, this is an incredibly worthwhile course. Thanks!
This is a life changing course. The course is loaded with important knowledge and tips, so you need to pay attention to every word. The number 1 benefit I got from this course is knowing the spaced repetition and Anki application, and they helped me a lot in improving my learning and my mind in general. Don't hesitate to take this course
Very helpful techniques to make sure you're making the most of your learning time - study/learn for the same amount of time, but getting more out of it. It addresses things like how to make sure you actually know the material (rather than the illusion of competence), handling procrastination, and making sure you gain long term retention.
An excellent course for learning new study tips and new ways of thinking about learning. The course provides lots of insight into how we learn and how we can use this knowledge to maximize our learning. The ideas taught in the course are backed by real neuroscience and help give you an understanding of how your brain works when learning.
After learning this course, I found out about various ways to improve my learning process and successfully implemented in my own learning. Some of the learning methods were already familiar, but I was always hesitant to adopt them. Barbara has a knack in convincing people to give these methods a go by outlining how they might be helpful.
I found this course enlightening and practical. The passion of the facilitators was plain to see and significantly enhanced my learning experience. I have gained a lot both in the explicit learnings of the course and by following the good design and delivery practices used. Thank you for the opportunity, experience and valuable learning.
This is an excellent course not only help one learning how to learn but many of the skills taught in this course such as using Pomodoro timer to help focus and overcome difficult problems, breathing exercise to calm our panic, exercise and good sleeping habit to help memory as well as better judgement can benefit us throughout our lives.
Informative, insightful and certainly brings about a lot of positivism in life. My sincere thanks to professors Barbara and Terrence for designing this beautiful course that truly helps in broadening the horizons about the way we look at things. Look forward meeting you again. Regards, Santosh Mishra, Business Development - Adani Group.
Really like the concepts and biological reason behind why I was suffering from learning effectively.This course really helped me to bring my perspective towards small- small things I was doing wrong.But now I believe that I will work more efficiently in any sort of learning fields.Thank You, Barb Oakley for teaching "Learn How To Learn"
By far the best course on here...regardless of the discipline. Not only are the professors insightful and enthusiastic but this course structured in a way to maximize your potential to learn the material. This course isn't full of 25 min lectures of a professor  talking in front of a green screen. It's interactive and engaging material.
This is the first online Course I´m able to finish. It´s an eye opener. I have an issue with Procrastination, even if I´ve tried some of the techniques explained in this Course before. But the way Barbara Oakley explains concepts and ideas in a clear and relaxed way has helped me to get that extra motivation I didn´t find anywhere else.
Learned HOW to actually apply study tips that we hear everywhere: stop procrastinating, active learning, spacing the material, etc. Lectures are packaged in interesting bite-size videos that explain the neuroscience of why the techniques work. The course empowers ordinary people that learning a lot of new things does not require genius.
Learned so many things that is impossible to list all of them here; I applied these skills immediately on my job and hobbies and the rate of learning has been improved consistently. You not only learn about learning but a many tricks and information also useful to improve your motivation and engagement. I strongly recommend this course.
Great course! Should be taught prior to HS/College so students can understand best habits to really learn the material and ingrain it in long term memory rather than short term or working memory. Especially loved the content on procrastination and the "Pomodoro technique". Thanks Barbara and everyone at UCSD who made this course happen!
Learning How to Learn is a great course.  It taught me a lot more about procrastination and taught me a lot of really good study techniques.  I am a 12 year old 7th grader and I really enjoyed Learning How to Learn.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to be a more effective learner.  Thank you to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
This really was an exceptional course, with a great balance of useful and practical tips for learning and information about how we learn. The concepts in this class aren't just limited in usefulness to learning. I've been using these techniques (especially the Pomodoro) to be more productive at work. Great job Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski!
I have never given a course five stars, and did for Learning How to Learn.  The reason is because the topic can be used to strengthen so many situations (school, work, sleep).  This course is helpful not only to me, but my family, which include two teenagers.   There are so many resources to connect with and learn more about the topics.
Brilliant journey into how our brain operates when we are studying new subjects or acquiring information from the world outside. A lot of interviews with interesting people who share their own techniques of memory training, studying and struggling with procrastination. Easy to understand and worth applying in your real study activities!
ESTE CURSO ME AYUDADO A ENTENDER LA CANTIDAD DE HERRAMIENTAS QUE EXISTEN PARA APRENDER MEJOR ME HE IDENTIFICADO CON MUCHAS DE MIS DEFICIENCIAS Y GRACIAS AL CURSO YA SE COMO CONFRONTARLAS ESTOY MUY AGRADECIDO CON LOS DESARROLLADORES DE ESTE CURSO Y TODOS LOS PROFESIONALES QUE PARTICIPARON APORTANDO SU GRANO DE ARENA CON SUS ENTREVISTAS.
As I started the course, I felt quite funny that I want to learn how to learn..i had preconceived notion that I might know how to learn properly, but as I went through the course I came to know about various interesting learning techniques and mind training techniques like Pomodoro, mind palace and lot more. really an awesome course!!!
"Brains do not come with an instruction manual. So we have to write one ourselves" -- Dr. Terry Sejnowski.A beautiful course that teaches you a vital life skill -- effective learning -- through engaging instructors who explain the material by breaking down important concepts into concise, to-the-point videos with helpful illustrations.
Before this course I didn't know how our brain works and what techniques can help in better learning. I was an A student, hold a masters degree, but with everything I've learnt by taking this course will help me in future to master anything faster and greater. I strongly recommend this course to everyone! It will broaden your horizons!
This is a basic course for any student who starts learning in true sense. In my opinion,  presentation of content was very simple and easy grasp but with huge impact.I will not only adopt these techniques in my life, but also teach them to everyone around me. Definitely suggest this course to them if they want to learn more about them.
Excellent course but taking it just begins The Path to self improvement. The course will provide the tools and resources but it's no magic bullet and one has to apply what one has learned in a purposely progressive way and be persistent! Every journey begins with a single step, and learning how to learn is one giant leap for brainkind!
I really enjoyed this course and found the way it was structured with short lessons that had relevant content a great way to study.  The course gave you varied learning techniques that were repeated to make each lesson more solid.I recommend this course and will defiantly look to see if the same tutors have any other courses available.
This is one of the best course, specially for those who are struggling in their studies or any other task and not getting result of their efforts. It is also helpful for those who want to enhance their learning skills. The course addresses many core issues that we as a learner are not aware of and provides techniques to deal with them.
A really useful Course - why didnt they give us this at school when I was aged 14? It could have saved me 30 years of frustration - This should really be mandatory for all students prior to their exams, not only do you find out why and how you struggle with difficult concepts and explaining them, but a complete toolkit on how deal with
I hope taking this course ten years before. I have learned many things, many techniques. I'm watching the lessons again and again. Actually prepare to take some courses on a new field, I'm recalling Learning How to Learn's tips to make my learning process effective. Thank to Mrs.Oakley! Love Learning team with all the Friday greetings.
I wish I had this course available when I was starting to learn. This courses provides a approach to learning any area one is interested or required to learn. Madame Curie said "Nothing is to be feared but understood...". This subject makes understanding something new easier so that we don't fear the new but enjoy the learning process.
Very helpful course, not only for students, but for any kind of learners. It is good to know how things work behind the scenes (here - in our brain..), and get some simple but effective tools to manage better with learning processes. Built from short videos, you can learn bit by bit, and practice the tools while learning how to learn..
Truly wonderful course on learning techniques on the process of learning. I definitely wish I took a class like this in high school or college before graduating!!! I will take a lot of techniques and ideas learned in this class with me into future endeavors as I attempt to change careers!! Thank you so much Barbara!! You're a gem!! <3
Excellent course! it really changed me the way i study and the way i see how the brain works!Been using some of the techniques since then and i'm developing new study habits that are starting to generate results really fast!. This course also woke the motivation to start new things, like a new language!this is MOOC is a must to anyone
I was very excited when I learned about the existence of this course, so I decided to take it. I must say it beat my expectations, not only because of the useful tips (some of which I was already applying unconsciously, but others I introduced in my daily routines), but also because of the clarity with which the materials are exposed.
This was one of the first MOOC's I actually completed because the content was so compelling and Barbara Oakley is such a wonderful teacher! She made everything really fun and interesting and made me want to keep coming back to watch her videos. Highly recommended for ANY student or people interested in the study of learning/education.
A very good course offering many tools, always in the framework of the latest knowledge about the human brain. A lot of relevant tests greatly make it easier "understanding" and "memorization". 
A subject that anyone should have made his own!Many thanks to Barbara and Terry for their always very clear and well structured presentation.
A great, concise course on how to "hack your brain" to become a better learner.If you are enrolled in any form of academic institution, the contents of this course are essential. And even if you are not in college or school at the moment, this class has excellent pointers on the whys and hows of life-long learning. Highly recommended!
Almost done with this course. It is already helping me understand how to learn. Very useful practical information. I hope that this course will be opened up as an on demand. I would love to share it with others. I think this is knowledge that everyone should acquire. Thank you for taking time to make this course and offer it for free.
I wish if I went through this course at the beginning of my University life. But no problem with that.  I am sure this course has changed my way of learning. From now on I will learn more effectively and efficiently than earlier. I didn't actually know how sleep affects our learning. Thanks a lot to the instructors and coursera team.
I learnt learning processes and new techniques that I will apply in the future. The video and concepts are very well explained by Barbara Oakley, the examples given were easy to understand and relate to.The quizzes were helpful in recalling the information learnt, overall I recommend the course to those who never learnt how to learn!
This is a very informative course, introducing you to a bit of neuroscience to back the information with scientific evidences and it is introduced in a way everybody could understand. It is really a course I can recommend to everyone wanting to have more efficient ways of learning and looking for scientific backings for those habits.
This course is for anyone trying to learn a new skill set as well as improve ones current position in life in general. For anyone trying to jump start TRUE change in your life it takes HARD WORK and DEDICATION. The tools learnt in this course can be applied in any circumstance the question is are you willing to try them for yourself.
This course may have changed my life and how I learn for ever.I'm very thankful to the creators and ppl that made it possible. This was my first MOOC but certainly not my last and I think it's a good set up for the courses to come.Thank you for letting me learn how to learn (for free(!)) since german education doesn't teach you that.
The material presented in this class will benefit anyone who wants to understand and employ more effective strategies for acquiring new skills and knowledge. It also gives great insight into some of the common frustrations of learning, and explains where those frustrations are actually normal and needed parts of the learning process.
It is amazing course and too useful i love the team and i think it is very useful for all people in all areas and all ages .It really helpful and gives you a lot of thoughts and techniques that you can use to improve your thinking and your life !! .    Thank you : Dr Barbra Oakley, Dr Terry and  all of the Learning How to Learn Team.
This a great course that I wish I had taken years ago. A lot of insights into how our brain works as far as learning is concerned. This course would absolutely help me to study more effectively and efficiently. And it will, since I'm not planning to ever stop learning. I also liked the optional material sections. Thank you very much.
This course should be the starting point of any academic career, it provides useful and actionable insights on how to deal with procrastination as well as providing deeper awareness on how to manage ourself in the learning process. It's a pleasure and a privilege to hear and learn form Prof. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
Learning How to Learn is a very helpful course. On top of the main course/videos, the interviews with different experts from different fields were very helpful. This course should be required in schools globally. I wish I have learned how to learned when I was younger. Thank you so much for creating this very relevant and fun course!
I loved this course!  It helped me a lot in the way I'd approach learning new things. It taught me to study more effectively and to stay the course on what I  was engaging in.  It gave me a different  perspective  at looking at problems I'm dealing with and applying better strategies or techniques in tackling them.Thank you so much!!
This is a great course to follow. Should appreciate work done by both Barbra Oakley and Terry Sejnowski , Such great instructors!!!! The experienced I gained by this course will surely improve my ability on controlling my mind more efficiently and will encourage me to face my exams as well as the future challengers as well.Cheers!!!
I really loved this course! I have always been a good student (with good grades) but I also knew that my methods of study were not the best, so with this I hope to take advantage on everything that I learned to make the best os my study sessions for the next semester. Thank you Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowsk, best teachers ever!!
This course is absolutely awsome. It was one of the best courses I've made. I've learned very important techniques and tips to improve my study performance and also my memory.

I gained awareness about the brain processes to think and memorize and this brought me awareness about how I can improve so that the study is more effective.
This Course is really help me a lot. I have learned some ways or skills,  including  the Pomodoro technique , to help me improve my scores,  I also have learn some knowledge about Psychology and Neurology  .I think I will insist do some exercise everyday and apply some techniques learned from this course to my study and life.Thanks.
I am a senior in college and I wish I had taken this course earlier! Some of the methods in this course are a little bit over top (at least for me); however, most of the information given is groundbreaking in the sense that it is so simple yet so effective. I will use the information learned from this course for the rest of my life.
I learned "How to Learn" first time after learning many things over a period of time. I could understand what mistakes, I made while learning in past. Pomodoro Technique is awesome and very much useful in focused way of learning. I could learnt to control habit of Procrastination. This is a fantastic course, must to do for everyone.
By coincidence I had decided to become fluent in spanish language by July of this year. Only a few days later I found this MOOC offering and enrolled.I believe that the strategies and techniques I learned in the class have been very helpful in this pursuit as well as my music studies and simple daily memorization needs.Thanks People
It is an amazing course. before I took this course, I had never thought that there is a way to learn new things. And I thought I was born to good at something. But now, with the new method, except that i am able to get rid of procrastination, i will be able to challenge many new subjects which are difficult to me before.Thanks a lot
I would recommend this course to anyone who has never really thought about the art of learning or who had a less than stellar early experience with leaning and is getting back into it as an adult. Backed with many references and verified science, the techniques grouped here will help anyone willing to put in the time and apply them.
It introduces some interesting ideas, such as the two thinking modes (focused vs. diffuse), how to avoid procrastination, tips for preparing tests etc. The most important thing I have learned from this course, however, is that with the proper methodology, you can master almost any subject, even those you thought were "not-my-thing".
A very important body of work and highly recommend before undertaking any serious study effort. Seeing real impact by applying some of the principles to both my day to day work and associated study. The course is clear, easy to follow and applies the techniques discussed to improve learning and retention. Well done Barbara and team.
This was the first course I opted to learn through coursera. And this course taught me to study my lessons in an effective and smart way.  The way they presented this course and their approach was easy and understandable. As a student this course helped me a lot. Thanks a lot.This course motivated me to learn more courses too.......
Astonishing! I found it extremely helpful and doable by everyone who seek to learn something new. It was great experience to learn various techniques to overcome any kind of problems which inevitably to be faced while learning. So, I am so thankful to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and the team of Learning How to Learn.
This is definitely a useful course. No matter how old you are and what you're studying it would be helpful to you. The model/system of learning this course gives to you could also help you to improve other parts of your life (for instance, the lecture about habits and how they are developed). I recommend! Many thanks to the authors
Learning how to learn is a subject that is NOT taught in schools even though it should as it will benefit students in various aspects of their life. If you were not taught in school about this, fret not as this course will teach you all you need to know about learning how to learn. It will also instil a passion for learning in you!
This course made me realize that my method of learning was flawed. After completing it, I have gained a better understanding of not just how to effectively learn but how to apply that knowledge. I would strongly advise that everyone should take this course before any other as it would provide the foundation of learning effectively.
You explained all the concepts with very good examples which helped me understand what is needed to be done (or avoided) to become a better learner! I really enjoyed watching all the extra videos with interviews too. I hope to apply some of the things I learned in your class, going forward, and becoming a better learner! Thank you!
Wow - what I've gained from this course was disproportionate to the ease of getting through it.  First Coursera class that I've successfully completed!  Still need to do the final assignment and dig around in the additional readings, but a big thank you to the team behind this course and for helping me become a much better learner!
Excellent course that I wish I had discovered sooner. Tremendously helpful techniques to take away from here and not just into academic studies but also everyday life. I look forward to making use of what i've learnt in the course. Practically the course is very digestible with plenty of 'optional' content should you be interested.
Simplicity, visuals & analogies...
I think it everyone should take this course. Learning how to learn should be a foundational subject taught in every school. It's a really awesome course. It provides some really simple and effective techniques to master the learning process.P.S. Barbara Oakley is so cool, she's one of my idols﻿. ﻿
This is an informative and effective course that boosts confidence and motivation for starting more complex and lengthier subjects. Very enjoyable to watch, I'm planning on re-watching this course sporadically after completed to maintain the powerful study skills I have gained and for the inspirational optional interviews included.
I have thoroughly enjoyed this course, I will be recommending it to all my friends. I have gained a lot of understanding on techniques that I used to follow when learning as a child or a young adult on a subconscious level, and now I finally know why. Also, the intro to the work of brain, has been very helpful to chunk the topics.
This course has provided me several tips to tackle daily problems that people face everyday and not only for studying also at work or any action which implies will from you. This will not change your life of study style radically but in the long term thanks to the impletation of these fantastic habits! 100% recomendable GO FOR IT!
This course has seriously helped me learn and organize myself while learning new amounts of knowledge and handling the procrastination that may crawl through at times. the effective methods such as pomadoratechnique and helpful interviews from people of other disciplines.Thank you for sparing your time to make such helpful videos.
I'm very thankful to Barbara for that course. It took me 2 years to finally finish it :) Although I see some area of improvement. There are a lot of myths related to learning: like best time to study is between 9 and 12 am, etc. and it would be great if these things were proved or debunked during this course. Thank you, Oleksandr.
This course provides the student a solid foundation for learning. The lessons are very informative and well explained. I also liked that the instructors provided additional reading resources and informative interviews. This course helped me deal with and effectively overcome my procrastination! I am truly grateful for this course!
Excellent.  The course progresses from simple to complex learning methods.I found Dr.Oakley's candid declaration of her anxieties with Math and Science gave me tremendous amount of encouragement to pursue my studies in Mathand Science. I am already sharing my knowledge from this course with others.Thanks to Dr.Oakley and her team.
A great course with a wonderful mix of nuggets of neuroscience and tips and tricks to make your learning faster, stronger, and more long-lasting. The videos are short and crisp and do not beat about the bush. The subtle element of humour in everything, including test options, adds to the awesomeness. Wish there's a sequel to this!
Best course ever on the subject. Barbara sure knows how to catch and keep one's attention and focus. I definitively recommend this course to anyone who is interested on learning how to learn or even someone who is just curious about the brain and the way it works when it comes to learning, memory or procrastination and much more.
Amazing courses, in content and delivery. I consider it a base for any learning journey, and I wish I learned this material 10 years ago.I felt that every word was carefully selected to deliver the right message, even the optional interviews were very inspiring and added value to the core content.Thank you so much Barbara Oakley!
Hi! Firstly I want to say that it's a great course to start your introduction with coursera, and it's a wonderful opportunity to try your abilities online. Also i want to notice fact that I have consolidated my previous knowledge,and knew many skills which will help me in the future to understand new material.Thank you very much!
As a curious learner but always struggle to fight my procrastination, this course helps me out.The structure of this course is easy to follow, and it serves lots of useful information from other experts.I'm currently writing a blog post regarding what I have learned after this course an will spend the time to revisit this course.
Great course that goes into the reasoning and happenings in the brain during the process of learning. Provides useful tips on various methods to better learn, and also those to help avoid inefficient use of time. Offered some new perspectives towards my own learning, tons of resources, and last but not least, very warm lecturers!
The amount of techniques that we get from this course help us not only throughout our learning processes but also can be considered life-changing skills: on the moment that we are able to recognise how our brain works, we become more aware on how to master it. I hope I can use those lessons on diverse areas of my life and career.
I really enjoyed this course, the first weeks took me more time to complete, but as I started using techniques that were recommended, then I could complete lectures and assignments on time but also having more time to relax. One of the things I really appreciate is the "focus on process instead of the product". Loved this course!
This was a great course. It was my second time attempting the course and I'm glad that I was able to finish it and learn from it. I had read A Mind for Numbers when I first attempted the course and enjoyed it. It will be good to revisit the learning tools in this course periodically to continue to help me become a better learner.
Great course to get the basics of learning methods. Even those who thought they were "in the know" on this topic will learn something new — especially through the supplementary interviews. It's also surprisingly funny, in a surprisingly non-pathetic way (i.e. not like "oh an academic is trying to be funny <eyeroll>) . Good stuff!
Brilliant course. It was an eye opener for me. I realized how many mistakes I had done in my life when trying to learn things. I think this course would be game changer in my life as I would 5X my speed of learning things. And knowledge and speed of learning is the prime ingredients to succeed. This course gives you super powers.
I have enrolled in this course to get some idea on how I could do better when I am writing my PhD thesis. As I went along, I felt I should have the privilege to enroll in this course years before, because that way my learning since then would be a lot more effective. Thanks for all who are involved in this course. Regards -- Riaz
I learned a lot from this course. The material is relevant and the course is not too long or too short. The instructors are very good and the material is well presented and easy to follow. I highly recommend this for high school students and above. And for older people like me who are "going back to school".  Thank you Coursera!
It is a very useful course that helped me a lot about how to learn. the course has provided wonderful techniques to study in a more effective and productive way. Dr. Barbara helped us to learn about how our memory works and how to study any subject not just related to our already field of work but anything like math and science.
Often we misunderstand the method of learning the things in right way, and blame your mental capacity of being inefficient to grasp. This course will help you to explore to break your mental barrier and makes learning meaningful and endorse the feeling discovering the right way to learn.Kudos the team for encrafting this course.
Very interesting and informative course! I `ve got a lot of helpfull tips and methods that can be applied in learning different things and type of knowledge. PS: And I finally understood why solutions to problems sometimes pops in my head after they were really needed. And how to increase the possibility of them being on time.=)
This is an amazing course! I found many new techniques that helps me learn better! Some techniques of the course I was using for a long time, but didn't know how and why it worked. With that new knowledge I can use it on purpose. I highly recommend it to anybody who need to learn something new....but who not in this day and age?
This was a wonderful course packed with valuable inormation presented in a swift and consistent way. I will probably revisit the material presented here while I implement the techniques on learning during my studies. Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and everybody who contributed to delivery of this course.
This course guides you to overcome your weakness in any particular field which you find interesting, and will convince you that if you decide to learn something new, you can master it just by following simple learning steps and some helping tools. It will also help you overcome procrastination. Good Luck Learning How to Learn :)
Very insightful, credible, and well-researched! The course has helped me realized the wrong things I've been implementing when it comes to my study habits, while simultaneously helping me become a better learner. I have also learned many other concepts regarding neuroscience. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone.
Thanks so much for this wonderful course. I'm a new coursera user so that was the very first course I took and I loved it! There's so much new helpful information I didn't know.Although I think the only problem with this course is it is only four- week course I'd love this course to be longer to get even more tools for learning!
I have completed the first week of the course.  I am fascinated by these brain facts, and examples of historical figures utilizing and understanding their thought processes!  Watching the video lectures by Professors Oakley and Sejnowski is rewarding.  They are smart and articulate, and I am powerfully improved by their example.
It makes me better. The result is the system how to work on any complicated task. I've tried a lot of different techniques that mentioned in the course, but I had no deep understanding how to really work and why is so important. I've got and understanding of my feelings and some cues what is okay, and what is okay, what is not.
The course is unimaginably useful, simple and entertaining. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski have managed, thanks to their intelligence, friendliness and teaching and communication skills, to create a very interesting and useful course for all audiences. It has been a real pleasure to be able to enjoy learning how to learn
It starts from the actual process we try to learn, its loopholes, the brains activity inside, the outcomes, the new techniques to learn effectively. One more thing is,  they have focused on ways to tackle procastination which i know most of us are struggling with and our memory. The interviews are must watch. I highly recommend
I believe this course should be required for everyone. And I mean everyone on earth. Every single person on earth should take this course. It is life changing. The most important course that I have ever taken. I wish I taken this course when I was younger and still in school. This course should be a requirement in every school!
This course is wonderful and bittersweet. I was the master of procrastination and "Illusions of competence." I will internalize these tools and use them on my journey through the rest of my life. I plan to teach my son, my family and friends as much as they will let me. I believe this can course and the tools can help them too.
This is a great course. Barbara's book - Mindset - originally inspired me to overcome my perceived short-comings in regards to mathematics and programming. This course is in a sense a course made out of this book. I've thoroughly enjoyed both and can recommend others to follow in doing so. Learn how to learn, you can do it too!
It is very well organized and explained course with easy tests just to recall informations (which is actually one of the techniques to better learn). It is nice to listen to Mrs Barbara's calm voice. I learned earlier how to learn but i found new very usefull techniques in this course :)

Thanks to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
It is fun taking this course.  I found the stuffs I learned from the course will benefit me for rest of my life.  I highly recommend to people who have an open mind and willing to learn.  This course required commitment. Just learn a little bit a day for 4 weeks, you will able to complete the course like I did.  Happy Learning!
This was a great course that helped me realize why I was already using a lot of important learning techniques while learning new skills. The material was presented very eloquently, not to mention the subject matter is inherently interesting. It was a great pleasure taking this course and I couldn't recommend this course enough!
The course is based off cutting edge research and provides valuable advice on the best way to learn anything. Many of the concepts and ideas discussed by Barbara and Terrence resonate clearly with my experiences. One thing I would like to see in a future course is some tips on how to tackle material that isn't student friendly.
It is fantastic course, helped me learn new and powerful techniques for learning. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise to students like us. Thanks for this MOOC as many would not have the opportunity to meet you guys or study with you in college to learn these techniques. This online course has solved the problem.
Absolutely amazing course. All the material is of high quality and it's clear they've worked really hard on the structure of the course. Once I began this course it was hard for me to turn away from it! An absolute recommendation for anyone who wish to deepen their understanding of learning in general and of their own learning.
The course was very lucid and helpful. The videos were short and straight to the point. The material was presented in an interesting way, and the instructors were very likable. 

I thought there were several points and facts that I had not known before that will help me to be a better learner in the future which is invaluable.
I highly recommend this course, learning how to learn by Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrance, given the methodology and the way they articulate the course I have to say I was impressed since the first week. That and the new concepts and techniques makes this course a must do as it open the doors to learning new skills efficiently.
OMG!!! I'm trying to become a language study coach. I have been incorporating new techniques for myself as a multiple language learner. I couldn't believe I passed the final test one the first shot with a 94%. I really put into practice what it said, and I am benefiting!!! Can't wait to do another course with these professors!
This course is priceless! I would like to express my gratitude and admiration to the Dr.barbara oakley and Dr. Terrence sejnowski for such a wonderful job, for developing this extraordinary and useful course about learning how to learn  and encourage so many people around the world to improve their skills! Thank you very much!
I wish I had taken such a course a lot sooner in my life (I am 34 now), but I'm very grateful for the whole experience, as it will allow me to better organise my life, habits and schedule so I can better acquire new skills without losing valuable time in the process, with structure and clear goals before facing new challenges.
With this short course, I was able to discover new ways of learning whatever topic or concept I want, even if I'm not initially good at it. I'm very thankful that I have learned how to learn the right and effective way. I also appreciate the interactive way of learning because of the videos, quizzes, and my virtual classmates.
I'm very grateful for this course, which gave me strength to face new challenges. I feel confident to try things apparently impossible, until now.  in addition to this, the course is fun and full of complementary material. You can go even further! Thanks a lot to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the Learning How to Learn Team.
Thanks Barbara for your time and efforts to make this course accesible for everyone. I have been trying to learn many things over the years. But, this makes my life very easy to learn with your techniques. I regret it not knowing these techniques from my college days. As the quote says "Better late than never".Cheers....Vishnu
This brief course provided me plenty of practical tools to enhance my learning and studying, as well as to avoid illusions of competence. I particularly enjoyed the lectures in the first and the third weeks, though the whole series of lectures are extraordinary helpful. Also, the optional videos are great and very encouraging.
If you want yo invest your time learning incredible tools to improve your learning and comprehension whit good teachers that have a big tour on this field, this course is for yo. Also if you already have tools but you want yo improve yours abilities. On my case I wanted to enhance my English and get incredible tools to learn.
Great class to take before embarking on a journey to learn new subjects. Taking this class has tremendously helped with my motivation when learning how to program for the first time. Highly recommend it to anyone. Especially helpful to those taking online courses, since it is hard to keep studying at times when we hit a wall.
This is an excellent course with useful information to improve your learning skills and based in scientific research. I recommend this course very much if you want to acquire new knowledge on how to learn better and more efficiently. Best of all is that the lectures are also entertaining so learning how to learn was also fun!
I think this course is powerfull because, it teach fundamentals tips, modes and many things related to the process of learning, since your mastered an idea until you keep the idea and reforce the knowledge not only using the memmory but also keeping in mind other perspectives, solution's, and related thinks with other carrers
At any stage in life, this course helps us understand our physical and psychological selves. Together with tools offered to make the best use of our bodies and minds, one can get ready to tackle topics that are new to us. I totally enjoyed learning the tools and was surprised to learn so much about our brain.Fantastic course!
Barbara Oakley patiently, intelligently, and quite effectively explains the growing body of science of memory, learning, and how to master the process. It seems heavily oriented toward college students, but even this 52-year-old working professional will benefit from applying the techniques described in this Coursera. Dig in!
Some topics are very well known by teachers and are told to every student, but It's nice to see a more deep explanation on how our minds work when they are learning and I really appreciate being taught these tricks to help our minds to learn from such knowledgeable academics and researchers like Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence .
This is an excellent course not only to learn how to learn but also to discover your own hidden potential. Regardless of age, gender, profession or purpose, this course can benefit anyone who is willing or meaning to learn anything at all; be it cooking, cricket or calculus. I am extremely grateful for this course. Thank you!
Insightful, and very helpful. This course will help you shape your studying and learning techniques, as it teaches you valuable skills. I would recommend it to anyone who is about to start a new course of study or someone who likes learning and wants some more efficient ways to do so and retain what new information is gained.
This is one of the most important courses that I have taken for my entire life, I will try in the future to design a similar course because many people don't have these successful skills taught in this course, I am highly appreciating Dr. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for their dedication and helpful tips and tricks.
I took this course out of curiosity. I ended up learning much more than I
 anticipated and it will be quite a while before I can integrate all 
that I learned. I very much recommend this class. The instructors are 
nice and clear, the material is interesting and well rounded, and the 
tests helps you integrate the materials.
One of the best and useful course.Throughly loved the delivery, content and structure of course.the instructors leave no stones unturned to let u have a firm grasp of the material.I wish if had undertaken this course much earlier during my college times, then it would have a tremendous impact on my outcomes.Loved the course.
This course was excellent! It was so good I stopped another course I was taking to focus on this course (so I could go back to the other course and future courses to study/learn better!)I can objectively say this course has been very useful and I will work to integrate what it teaches going forward in my studies and at work.
The Masterpiece of the Guide on learning how to learn. Especially the teacher like Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski is the best teachers in the course. The course completely overviews the process of learning and helps you learn strategies for your life by changing the perspective of seeing through the tools on learning.
This course provides great tips for becoming a more advanced thinker and learner. I would encourage anyone to take this course who is looking to maximize their potential. This course is aimed at college students but I believe that professionals looking to expand upon their skills will also benefit from learning how to learn.
Great course! THanks for the paced interleaved sessions :)WIsh there was a continual mechanism we could come back to and build on our learning as time goes on. I think this was a great courses introducing us to important concepts in learning how to learn and not just what to learn. Hopefully can get rid of bad habits myself.
The course is interesting and practical in approach. The instructors are highly skilled in their approaches. This course has help me to improve in learning because i  now know some of the various techniques of learning that have been proven to be effective through research. i say thank you to my instructors and to coursera.
Thank you so much for the course! It approaches the essential information in a simple and perfectly digestable way. The course gave me a whole lot of useful tips for basic life challenges: studying, personal projects and professional growth. I will definitely use techniques and ideas presented in this course on daily basis.
This course helped me re-establish an approach to learning, something I will continually practice throughout the rest of my life. With clear-cut examples backed with scientific studies, the contents of this course and the effective use of metaphors/analogies, my confidence in learning has improved dramatically. Thank you!!!
Before completing this course, I had struggled with my studying because I did not know how to digest all the knowledge and information effectively. But through each session, I gradually get a hold of how to chunk the information, how to link them together and use them in the test effectively. I highly recommend this course.
This course is very practical and the knowledge gained is balanced by plenty of opportunities to work things out and actually use them. I highly recommend this course for everybody! I've passed on a link to this course to my son, if that tells you anything about the degree to which I believe this course is just plain GREAT!
This course is enlightening . I learned things about how my own brain works that I would have never come up with on my own. I imagine tha I will benefit greatly from this course in my further studying.I recommend this course for anyone who ahs issues with test taking or wants to get even better results on their test taking.
If you've ever struggled in a subject, I highly suggest taking this course. Dr. Oakley helps to guide you into being the best learner you can be. There are also several interviews by professionals who talk about the brain or their own experiences with training their brain in order to learn a difficult subject. Go Grizzlies!
One of the best online courses I have every taken. For that matter, one of the best courses I have ever taken anywhere. It is one of the most useful subjects anyone can take. It should be a required course, taken in the summer before becoming a freshman in high school, then taken again the summer before college. Just great.
One of the MOST useful courses I have ever taken. Already using all of the techniques and achieved distinction level grades in my degree in Earth Sciences. Cannot speak highly enough about Dr. Oakley. If you want to learn anything better, if you want to help your kids succeed in school teach them how learn with this course.
Very informative and helpful. I learnt new skills and new interesting information. I was able to believe more in my learning ability. I was able to learn why certain things I already know are important are, in fact, important. I've gained some valuable skills which I am already putting in to practice now! Very worth-while.
Found this MOOC, and Mindshift while searching for an intro to computer science MOOC.  Couldn't be more happy I took it.  Absolutely take this class, everyone.  The topics, and lessons are well worth everyone's time and attention.  Even if you already think you know how to learn.  Much food for thought in this one.  Peace.
This is my second review. This is an amazing course on learning techniques, explained bite-sized. The course material, the instructors, the sequence of lessons, the clarity of the videos, the supplementary content is worthy of appreciation. Thanks to everyone in Coursera who made it possible. We owe it to you, one and all.
This course is incredible. It really changed the way I used to think about learning and the mind. The professors (specially Barbara Oakley) are really charismatic and didatic, they can make you pay attention and understand complex concepts in a very simple way. I am very grateful to have had this course, thank you so much!
A lot of thanks to Barbara Oakley and her colleagues! I think this course is essential for everybody.  I wish I had known all these technics when I was a student. It helps me to be more effective in my work performance (I can handle procrastination and frustration) and my everyday life. I feel more fulfilled and confident.
Great course - I understood that all the difficulties in my previous studying was connected to not knowing certain techniques. Learning can be fullfilling and lifechanging experience, great joy but also can be struggle - this course will help those who want to constantly learning and not for grades but for some higher goal
Amazing course with lots of useful strategies and approaches in learning. Teaches effective ways to memorize, avoid procrastination, & perform well on tests. The lectures are interesting and stimulating & the instructors do a great job emphasizing key concepts repeatedly in order for viewers to properly retain those ideas.
great work by faculty team, I m no psychologist and i was just free, so took this course, initially i faced some issues coz i didn't  understand some brain structure topics, but did not give up, the quiz questions are good .also as each video is small (max7-8 minutes), you wont feel bored and will be able to finish them of
This course was very interesting, informative, fun and all the presentations were nicely filmed, it was a pleasure to listen Barbara about procrastination and memory.I will definitely use all of the advices that I heard in this course. Sometimes we just need to hear something we might already know - to use it in real life.
Very good course, I enjoyed it. In a playful and "light" atmosphere, you get in touch with concepts about your brain and its way of working - ideas that took years of studying and thinking from very smart people.Get these ideas to work in your benefit and test them in your own "laboratory of thoughts", then get productive!
Funamentally mind-changing! I loved this course because it opened my eyes to how I could study and learn new subjects. Now, instead of shirking away from somewhat daunting new subjects like coding or finance, I can finally learn with confidence knowing I will come away knowing more and understanding more about the subject.
Very very helpful. Everyone should take this course! We often work very hard on subjects but we lack the technique to learn something new so we tend to leave it imcomplete or complete it with not much satisfaction. This course teaches us how to utilize every single minute of your hard work and that too in a positive sense.
This course tells us and reiterates the simple mistakes we make while learning. Although a grown-up individual will know these techniques back of his/her mind, this course emphasizes how we all have been doing things wrong for many years. Its a short but valuable course is recommended to anyone willing to improve oneself.
Excellent course, by all means. I would like to thank everyone who was a part of creating this amazing course and making all these complex ideas really simple in the most academic way. This course is absolutely useful and life-changing for anyone who's trying to do self-improvement in any domain. Thank you very very much!
I learned how to use the diffuse mode, I also acquired mnemonic techniques and I also learned not to enter editor mode while I write. in general I have achieved greater efficiency thanks to the awareness of how the brain works in learning. it was interesting, funny and above all very useful. Thanks. a wonderful experience
I was profoundly impressed by this course presented by these two amazing and interesting individuals who spent their time and energy on helping others to improve their learning skills! Barbara Oakley is a masterful story teller, - so engaging! Her kindness and good nature shine through in her narrative. Thank you so much!
Naturally we all learn daily basic, however to see the real process behind learning you must take this course. As instructors says, this course is manual for learning how to learn. When you read and understand manual  you can control a equipment, likewise when you know the learning manual you can control your own learning
I highly recommed this course for everybody (teachers, parents and longlife learners). This course gives you really practical tips about how to maximize your effort when learning and great theoretical background to undertand why those tips really work. Thanks to the instructors and the team involved in creating this MOOC.
This course changed my life. In this decades, people lost concentration, although it's not their fault(include me). It teaches you how to learn more efficient and get more concentration, and finally it can change you life if you practice the skills frequently. Hope you guys have a fun here. Thanks everyone in this course!
Useful stuff for everyone. Students, teachers, parents, the professors are clear, engaging, and experts in their field. I cannot speak to how exciting it was for someone to inform me about how learning occurs, with lots of applicable methods. Easy to learn, engaging, and interesting, 5 stars to these wonderful professors.
This course was easy to follow, yet full of extremely useful elements. I have greatly enjoyed every lesson, and I am grateful to the instructors for creating a course that is at the same time fundamental and accessible to people with tight schedules. It's really never to late to learn how to learn. Absolutely recommended.
A very good course indeed , it's amazing to know that learning can be done at any stage of life.Really enjoyed it ,looking forward to use all the techniques that were taught and surely will tell my students all these techniques and help them in there learning.Thanks a lot Dr. Barbara  Oakley and Dr .Terrence Sejnowski. .
A must take course! This is absolutely worthy and everyone should be taking this course for anything that you would like to study. Language learning, Calculus, Chemistry, Anatomy class, anything will be easier if you understand the basic concept and methods of learning. After this course there's nothing you cannot learn.
I took the course as I am trying to get certified for some new technologies during the lock-down. I wasn't expecting much but I was amazed how this course is applicable to every days life. I recommend this course to all, students, employees, employers, stay home parents..etc I might even recommend it to my future kids :D
My first course on Coursera. Amazing tutors and a lot of new ideas and techniques to enhance one's learning ability. How to fight motivation, stress and illussions of learning. How to improve memory. How to prepare and take any test....Very good course material indeed!Thank you Barb and Terry,thank you very much Coursera
Really fun and informative course. You might be a great student and do some or all of these things your entire career. Maybe you didn't know why they worked for you. This course will help with that. Maybe you're like me and have never been particularly effective with your study time. This course will also help with that.
I really enjoyed the course because if you don't have good learning habits, you will get all needed clues and if you know already how to learn it reminds you very good tips.
They have a great sense of humour which makes sometimes the lessons and the tests more entertaining.
I do recommend this course for sure.
Thank you.
"Learning how to Learn" was a very interesting and enjoyable a course. A definite recommendation for those who want to improve their abilities to learn, be it a beginner or someone well versed in the arts of learning. The information was very helpful and easy to digest, and the suggested readings are well worth the read!
I took this class prior to any others on coursera because I wanted to make sure I would get as much as I could out of these courses.  I'm glad I did.  Using many of the techniques they suggest I have been able to study and retain much of the information I have been learning.  I wish I had known about this many years ago!
The course is quite easy to grasp and understand. Many of the material offered seems to be simple and relatively logical. However, it alludes us to put all of these concepts into  one course/material in order to be consciously aware on how to effectively and efficiently learn. Definitely a great course that I recommend !
Learnt a lot from this course!!!!!1) Where I stand and where to improve upon.2) Pomodoro will help in building a better overall structure.3) Study techniques that were new to me.4) Remembering things gets a lot easier.5) The advantages of repetitive testing.6) Become a better test taker.Thank you very much Coursera!!!!!
Great course, It helped me a lot with realizing the weaknesses I have in learning, The techniques I learned will also help in normal, everyday tasks. It was truly a great experience, and I'm grateful for getting to do this course. Huge thanks to Professors Oakley and Sejnowski, they did a great job building this course.
I love this course, because giving me some new insights that useful to improve my ability to learn something new, something i want to master. but, i have a little bit complain bout the quality of the sound of the video, that i found some of them is hard to be heard. Overall it is good, i suggest you to take this course.
It´s a great course, I learned many tips that helped me to really understand what I'm learning and everything with a scientific method. The teachers are really good and explain quite well the material, they suggest other books, websites and provide many links to interesting readings about brain and the process of learn.
I read a lot about neuro science and trie and apply it as best possible in my working career and as a manager of a small businessThis course gets the balance between scientific foundation and practical application just right!Exceptionally informative. Will incorporate in training of our business intelligence consultants
An incredible course that presents a powerful tool kit for learning, understanding ideas, topics and picking up skills. Since learning is a never ending journey through life, there are not too many better ways to spend your time. This is a meta skill that should precede any and all other goals that one hopes to achieve.
What an excelent class! super dinamic, Barbara is a really good teacher and I will say that a good influencer in order to motivate people who think that learn or memorice something is the most difficult thing on the world. Thanks a lot your tips and lessons help me a lot to keep concentrate in my studies and my projects
Very powerful and explicit especially very for persons who understood that to make this world a better place requires better and an excellent grasp of knowledge. Learning How to Learn gives you that mental capacity to learn more effectively since you cannot think on what you don't know.Thanks, I'm truly enjoying myself.
Fantastic course! A lot of material and a lot of thinking to be done. Between the lines there is so much more than what it seems.. only practice can internalize such simple but proven-to-be-the-best techniques thought in this course and bring incredible improvements. So start practicing immediately and.. enjoy the ride!
I think everyone should take this amazing course, because it's very wise to learn how to learn before you dive into learning blindly. Also, the professors in the lectures are very inspiring and fun. The course is very well organized itself. Also, there are many extended learning materials waiting for me. Come and join!
Amazing course! Now, just to say (but this comment is regarding the Coursera certificates) it would be great if they can put the amount of hours that were taken in every course in the certificate, some goverments and companys in other countrys validate the course only if the certificate shows the amount of hours of it.
The 'Best course'  on effective learning,  I've found so far online. The information and techniques presented in the course, are very effective in every phase of life.I truly appreciate the great efforts made by the instructors and all the people involved towards building such a nice  informative and innovative course.
This course is well organized. The concepts and techniques are patiently illustrated by the teacher. Some of the optional interviews are also very helpful. I really appreciate the one with Keith Devlin. Thank you Mrs. Oakley for this wonderful course which is a true instruction manual for how to use our brain to learn!
Very useful course! Specially if you are in school or college, but good for anyone! Very practical, interesting and inspiring, great tips. I enjoyed it very much. Now I have a very clear idea of how to study to learn (not to just pass a test) and I will be able to help my son very soon with these techniques. Thumbs up.
I loved it very much , it helped me in improving my skills and trying to find my passion by learning and have a great energy to do great things , it is my pleasure to have this course from you doctors. It gave a good insight of the learning methodologies which we have often heard of but not given due importance. 
ors.
Best course ever. I have explored many seminars and mooc to understand the science of learning and recalling. I have found this course very helpful to understand how our mind works, because only then we can harness the power of mind. I recommend all of you to take this course and make the best use of yourself. Karthik
A great course that I should have taken long ago.  But taking this course at any stage of your life is worth it.  The course is well planned, well presented and keeps the interest live throughout the length of course.Thank you very much and I will spread the word to all members of my family, friends and acquaintances.
This course not only changed my mindset, it also change my life. It sounds like a cliche but I truly noticed a change in myself. I became more confident to take other courser on subjects that I thought were too difficult to learn, and I had success! That has helped me to get new opportunities at my university and job.
This course is unique and brilliant. All the techniques and observations in this work are backed up by scientific studies. Students will understand learning is not an auto-pilot activity, but deliberate practice. Thanks to an amazing instructor for making this course and helping out thousands of students in the world.
Now I have an entirely new perspective about the process of learning. This course took me to a new horizon regarding learning and retaining information. I urge every learner or scholar in any field to take this course. I am sure they won't regret the time spent on it. Thank you very much Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski .
Wonderful Course, wonderful professors.. I really enjoyed to see how we can improve our learning process though a very wide range of videos, examples, texts, and great, great interviews!! I really enjoy Professor Barbra!! I want to met her pesonally to hear her historys while she was in Antarctica!!! Thanks everyone!!
The course has amazing content. It's a very structured with an interesting approach. For someone who procrastinates a lot, I didn't get bored! I wish we had this course way back in High School. So many tips and my favorites are the Pomodoro and the Memory Palace techniques. I highly recommend this course for everyone.
Best course I ever had so far!!! I love the way the two main professors teach in these great fantastic videos, I love the speed they talk and it really makes sense to me. I really love these interviews that Barbara did with those great people in different areas. It's really worth my time!!!! I can't appreciate more!!!
It was the first course that I finished in Coursera and I loved it. I really got excited about what I was learning and I've been using it in my work and in my stydy. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. It was the incentive that I needed to invest in myself again and learn new things that I always wanted to know.
This course is an excellent mix of practical exercises and lessons, mixed with deeper understanding of principles found in the science of learning, helping students understand how the brain learns and how we process and store information.I think this is a superb class for a subject that is highly relevant to everyone.
The course was very insightful. I learned a lot and it helped me gain a different perspective on how to study compared to traditional study methods. Understanding how one thinks and learning ways to correct common misconceptions would be very helpful and in realizing one's own study style and become a better learner.
I have really enjoyed this course, a lot more than I thought I would. Doing this course has made me think about my own learning techniques and what I have been doing right or wrong. It was really interesting and it has inspired me to look more into how to be a better learner. I would definiteky recommend this course.
i am tremendously happy for enrolling to such a great course like  that   it helped me a lot ,every single information that i have learnt helped me in my ordinary life ,i have been more aware a bout every thing happens to me ,i ma really  honored for covering my free time by attending to this course,thank you so much
This course presents a number of strategies which will definitely make your learning more effective -- if you apply them!  Spaced retrieval, one of the key strategies, is notorious for not being applied even by students who have been exposed to the research on its value.  So, learn how to learn, and go out and DO IT!
After having spent years away from any structured or institutional learning, this course gave me a great set of tools, perspectives, and strategies that are making the undertaking of resuming study much less of a 'boogeyman' - I can't thank Barb and Terry enough for bringing this course to fruition. Thanks, everyone.
Very interesting course. Learning how to learn is important for us, because homo sapiens due evolution are design to learn in jungle or deserts or country land but as we have live in earth from 200 hundred years ago (and before) and fast changes make that us need to learn diferent to master tecnologies and knowledge.
I can highly recommend this course to learners of all ages. I feel I got a lot out of it and wish that I had taken it many years earlier in my life. I'm now encouraging my kids (one in high school, one in college) to take it. I'm convinced both will benefit from it a lot and become better and more efficient learners.
An absolutely phenomenal course. I will recommend this to all of my students and colleagues. The course design, techniques and delivery were excellent. I appreciate the time and thought put into every detail as well as the humor and personal touches. It was worth every minute and will be useful in many walks of life.
Wow, I'm pretty impressed, I'm doing this course now for a week [2nd approach] and I can see the first results already. I'm confident now to handle a lot more tasks than ever before and yes I'm happy. If you have some struggle with learning, here you can figure out effective and useful ways to approach it. Good luck!
Amazing!! It gives tools that are very useful, it's nice to watch, easy, and it also explains many of our behaviours and habits in a very useful way. I love it and I think it can be useful for learners but also for teachers because it gives a new perspective on how we learn and the best ways of approaching knowledge.
This is an Awesome course ! it's  a "page -turner".. it is so deep yet easy to understand and incorporate into your daily life..i Just Love it ! I would like to thank the instructors especially Dr Barbara Oakley for her efforts to make this course easy and comprehensive for everyone !Highly Recommended for Everyone !
Excellent tutors and material.I am 59 years old now and wish I had known this stuff when I was at school and before I decided to go into further education,at the age of 30. I would have even got a better grade than I did for my degree. I think this course should be part of any school's / college curriculum Thank you.
I so thoroughly enjoyed this course Barb Oakley is wonderful and engaged me the whole time. I will be reviewing this course as much as I can over the months to get those "chunks" into my head. Testing always has me concerned but the advise here made a lot of sense, like getting a good sleep the night before!!  Thanks
So First , a lot of thanks to Coursera and Syrian youth assembly to give me this chance to start online courses and learning new things .The course was very interesting and useful in all respects, and I learned a lot from him through explanations and examples thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski .
That's just wonderful! So many suggestions to improve a process solving difficult problems, learning something new and tricky things. Unlike other sources of the tricks described here, in this course it's explained why these techniques work. That's really very useful. Especially for me, who doesn't believe in magic.
great course if you really want to learn something new take this course. course have really good stuff, concepts that will going to help in your learning.I found about new learning concepts that i can use in my real life with learning new things. thanks for this course. awesome three weeks with learning how to learn
This was the very first I enrolled since joining Coursera. It blew me away. Barb has a way to keep your attention. Regarding the content: very good stuff. A lot of thinks I did not know. Please don't skip over the optional interviews. These provide great insights of how very successful people deal with this subject.
I'm really glad I took this course. I was able to understand how learning works scientifically. With the concepts I learned, I was able to manage my study time and approach my learning efficiently. The course didn't only taught be about learning, it also inspired me to learn more. I definitely recommend this course.
I've had learning difficulties ever since I was a child. The information in this course has helped me be effective in my studies for the first time in my life. I've also enjoyed the course greatly and recommended it to friends. It's been fun to do and extremely helpful. I've actually been excited to do my lessons !
This was a great course. As someone who is trying to learn coding and doing my MA in English Literature, I desperately needed to learn how to learn and quick. This course helped me by giving me simple and easy techniques that I can work on to study effectively. Thank you SO much to everyone who worked on this MOOC.
I am very impressed by the course material and how overqualified the instructors are, dedicating their  time to provide students with a wealth of information at no cost. There is a sincere motive behind their teachings and if one truly engages in the class, they too will uncover hidden potential within their brain.
I learned many new techniques in this course that I am very excited to turn into habits.  This course can help anyone learn more about how their brain works when it comes to learning new ideas and concepts.  I gained a true understanding of many ideas that I had heard about previously or even experienced on my own.
Learning How to Learn has given me more insights on how our brain functions. By understanding these basic concepts, I have learnt tips on how to make a difference in studying and mastering new things, retaining information as well as to build confidence in my learning journey. It is a great course for all learners!
I really like it. It's pretty scientific in explaining how things work and I really enjoy that aspect of the course. I must admit that I was looking for some solid techniques, and it does have them, the surprising part it that it goes deeper into how things work in your mind which makes it quite enjoyable for me :)
Learning how to learn provided a wide array of  useful study information.  The material was well organized with each unit building on the previous subject.  This course is a great refresher for students who have taken a break from coursework or anyone that desires better retention of information. Highly Recommend.
The course focuses on techniques you might require on Learning more efficiently. The team has done a great work in explaining each and every aspect. If you want to start up on this course, well the age doesn't matter any living person on this planet can opt. for this course unless you want to learn about learning!
Fascinating concepts.  You think you know how to learn but this explains a lot of great core concepts to make learning more efficient and effective, which I love.  Gives you the foundation of learning to be able to tackle other things on this site and that is why I choose this to be the 1st class I completed here.
Simple, smooth and covers various ideas related to learning: the process of learning from a neurological perspective, bad studying habits, interviews and advises from experienced figures, test taking tips... It actually was so rich and much more than what I had expected! I strongly recommend it to every learner :)
So glad to be studying this course. I am very grateful to the prolific materials this course provided. All interviews provided new ways and thoughts about everyday life.  Finally finished my first course on Coursera, I hope more to come thanks to all the studying methods. Thank you again and wish you all the best!
This course has definitely made me think introspectively at how best I learn as well as the many valuable items to use to better learn and understand the subjects that I both enjoy learning as well as those that I did not enjoy from the past.I look forward to continue my learning through the many Coursera courses.
Wonderful course that explains the neuroscience of how to learn successfully regardless of the subject. It supplies different methods along with the science and data to back it up. The interviews were insightful as it allowed you see how passionate some of the experts. I learned a lot and plan to keep on learning!
I love this course, I´m into learning& teaching & neuroscience in education,then this course was really helpful to counterbalance my previous knowledge of the topic.It is really good if you want to learn how to study better and at the same time to undertand how to take advantage of our different modes of thinking.
Very useful course with great optional readings and interviews to supplement your material. Core knowledge is good enough too but that little bit of extra really helps. This is stuff I'll definitely be using years from now so I'm glad I took this course as it'll affect pretty much everything I do from here on out.
As a psychology major I was already familiar with most materials covered by the course before I took it, but Dr. Oakley did a wonderful job by making everything so approachable and attractive as well as creating a really friendly learning atmosphere. Definitely I will come back to these videos again in the future.
It was well-worth taking this course. It has shown the foundations of effective and stressless learning process. Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski proved that it is vital to focus on studying process, not on the product of the studies. Only this way we can further proceed in our educational and professional lives. 10/10.
It was a very meaningful experience. From the beginning I started to learn and apply the many ideas that the course bring to me. I liked the way that the instructors made easy to learn so complex concepts. The strategies and exercises are excellent and challenging, I am going to apply them for the rest of my life.
Powerful and easy techniques for learning. Confirms and perfects some of the  techniques we learnt  in earlier years as a student and beginner. Animations are funny and powerful . Weekly course summary are short and effective.Recommended for everyone who want to learn and learning in life never stops!!! Good work.
I would strongly recommend this course to each and every individual who would like to improve their learning techniques and increase the LTM capacity. It clearly states all techniques to attain the desired outcome by making us understand how our brain functions rather than simply focusing on the techniques itself.
I've learnt so much about study techniques that work and the ones that don't. I was able to identify with most of the methods that does not work as it were methods that I personally used. I am eager to start learning other courses and applying what I've learnt in this course to see how my study habits would have i
Fantastic course to understand how well we can make use of various techniques, avoid obstacles to learn any topic. It also deals with the power of human brain. surely these techniques will help build the self-confidence of an individual when they are able to concentrate and make the best use of the mental agility.
It was immensely helpful to have such a wider perspective on the topic. There were many aspects that was quite new to me. Earlier I had the fear of learning harder topics but this course gave me confidence to try a totally different way of looking into problems and simultaneously grasping harder items. Thank you.
The course has changed my mentality. It isn't so focus on the act of learning itself, but instead give useful tips to less procrastinate, be more efficient, how to retain information better etc. It is well structured, and I think that it is more impactful than watching bunch a self improvment videos on Youtube :)
This is the best MOOC of the world not of coursera only. I actually improved my CGPA and my understanding of the stuff I study through this MOOC. Both the trainers are the best in the field. This course is a must for every learner of any age group on this planet. I cannot thankyou guys enough. Love from Pakistan.
It was very fortunate that i found this course, im  very thankful for both the instructors  and their team. Its very much valuable information regarding how our brain works that i got to know from this course and i have started to share the knowledge and implement it with people. Thank you all very very much.....
Our brain doesnt come with instruction manual. But this course gives an insight of how brain works and what techniques you can use to trick procrastination. I am implementing the techniques in these courses and I feel a lot happy with life now. Its worth the effort listening to these lectures. Highly recommended.
I am extremely grateful for the opportunity of learning one of the most beautiful subjects I have come to know: Learning How to Learn. Barbra Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski are not only great scientists and explores, but have the gift to teach and reach into the hearts of those who truly search for their guidance.
Incredible, made me actually start studying other things and do work over the summer rather than being lazy and just sitting around all day. Would recommend to anyone struggling with procrastination and other problems along those lines. Really open your view on learning and is incredibly helpful and motivational!
This course really helped me to analyse myself. Now I can master my tough subjects. It has highlighted all small details which I missed while learning. Focused & diffused modes are important & I implemented the pomodoro technique including other advises in my learning process. I recommend this course to everyone.
This is information everyone needs to know. I used to feel so much frustration, doubt, and anxiety when I would try to learn something new. Now, I realize, it wasn't because I was stupid or slow, but that I wasn't studying in a way that helped my brain grasp new material. Thank you so much for making this course.
Best course I have taken on Coursera. Very deep concepts explained so well and in a manner such that anyone can understand so easily. Also, the optional interviews included are so inspiring and tells us many other things that we can apply in our lives to make it better and understand any concept in a better way.
Before reviewing this course, i thought it won't help me a lot, i have already got my University degree with a high grade " Medical college". but after getting this course, i found new valuable techniques to study more efficiently and it helped me way beyond what i have expected .thanks for this precious course.
Really makes the difference for those who need to change their minds about what can they learn or achieve. Makes you understand with simple words how your brain actually works and what can you do to get the most out of it, also gives you the topics so you can continue learn about the techniques of your interest.
This is one of the best courses I've ever taken on Coursera. It's not only about learning the methods, tips to learn and study better but it's also a inspiration for learners who are not confident on their learning ability. I am so glad that I have chosen to take this course prior to my master's study program!!!
I didn't realize how much progress we have made (as a human race) about understanding the brain.  This course really takes a lot of that information and make it into a practical usable way to learn, understand, and grow.  Thank you for helping me understand that there are better ways to learn, retain, and apply.
The best course for all who want to learn new things. It helped me to figure out where I was doing wrong and how can I use my brain to learn new things in the best way. This helps even if you are not in love with the subject you are learning. The presentation of the course is amazing, peer assignments are great.
Great course, delivered in an original, fun and easy to grasp wayHelped me better connect the dots related to activities from my daily routine, understand what I'm doing wrong and how could it be betterIt certainly imporved my daily performance, although I did't even take it from a student learning point ot view
This is really a great course to learn how to learn. It is very powerful and helpful course for individuals, leaders, teachers, parents and students. Various concepts of brain working and how we store the information for short term and long term memories. Detailing in technique to improve your ability to learn.
As someone who did not go to college immediately after high school, I found this course to be an excellent refresher and teacher on effective learning. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, and will likely adopt some of the methodologies from this course into my work as a training coordinator. Thank you!
It is certainly a great course. It has changed my view of thinking and mastering. I can guide my students and teachers under my training through a new way to think and understand from a different angle. May Allah help the team leaders and members to provide quality education and training to the world community.
A great course - teaches one of the most important subjects that are rarely being thought: "How to learn?" It helped me realize some issues I've had with my current learning methods and gave me tools for tackling future learning problems.Explained in a really simple enthusiastic and fun way. Highly recommended.
The course I was looking for to better my learning methods and to help my kids do their best in school. The teachers explain themselves in an optimum way, the videos don't last too long and are easy to follow even if I am not a native speaker. The tasks to accomplish are clearly explained. I really recommend it
Interesting and helpful course. Wise format, good lectures,
memorable images. Lots of useful information presented in a pleasant, sometimes
fun and always easy-to-remember way. Enough testing so you're sure you get the
main idea and concepts. Don't miss the additional reading and interviews. They
are great too.
I truly enjoyed this course, lots of helpful information and great tips/exercises to help with the learning process. This is a great course for anyone that is planning on learning anything, the concepts crossover to just about anything. I would like to thank the professors for putting this together and sharing.
Great primer course for any discipline. The material is well-designed, well-paced, and (for lack of a better word) joyful. There are many practical tips and techniques that I look forward to further ingraining as the weeks go by. I am grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowki for their good work.
The course gave a great insight into how to learn. There are certain techniques that I've already been using, but many of them were new to me. The explanation of why some methods work and some don't was extremely clear.Thank you for this great course, I will gladly use the lessons learned in my future learning.
I was skeptical about the course at first. The presentation seemed pretty old-school, although interesting. As the course progressed and I applied the theory and methods from the course I started learning far better and absolutely love the course! Perfect for anyone and everyone who embraces life-long learning.
This is an amazing course. It teaches easily a lot of tools to be a better learner, and explains the reason why they work. They even used the techniques on the course itself to make you learn better its contents.Also Barb has a great attitude in all the videos, and Dr Terrence touch very interesting subjects.:)
This course is incredible. The presenters are wonderful, clear, articulate, smooth delivery. The use of the metaphors and analogies were EXCELLENT. I also like the way the quiz questions were designed. The videos were well-done, good amount of time for each one, has images, narrator, text, color- was engaging.
Wish I'd had a course like this when I was young!  Nevertheless, the course was very informative, with a casual tone and friendly teachers.  Concepts that are complex are broken down and you can make sense of the information easily.  Can't wait to begin applying what I've learned to my "real" life.  Thank you!
it has been a journey into my own mind. I greatly enjoyed learning how to learn. I suggested this course to everyone i know, everyone who i feel need help and direction. This has been a very useful experience. I can see myself taking this course again, after i have some time to analyze all i learned.Thank you!
I'm only on the first week, and I started this class as an ABSOLUTE skeptic, but it really is helpful. I mean... I even feel like I knew a lot of this, and EVEN SO the class is illuminating, motivating, and truly feels like it's making a difference for me. I can't explain it, but I can definitely recommend it.
Love it. Absolutely fantastic! Interesting to the bone!The way of sharing knowledge make a difference from MOOC to MOOC. Barbara is all heart and knowledge. A authentic teacher, eager to make people think and learn. Absolutely, adore her!Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Thanks to you I'm a better Mom.=)
Taking this class has given me solutions to my biggest problems when it comes to learning and studying. If you are a person who is struggling with memorizing, studying, procrastination, and or anything really. I would highly recommend taking this class; you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from doing so.
I am not even halfway done with finishing the course, but it is already helping me in learning. It is a shame that knowledge like this is not given to us at the very beginning of our education. That way a lot of human potential would not be lost like it currenty is being lost when children are sent to schools.
Great Course!Very easy to understand and apply in daily basis.I would recomend that If you're starting to participate in MOOCs courses and specialization, consider to include at the very begining to take this Course.Barbara Oakley and her team did a good job preparing this amazing workshop.Regards,Carlos Galan
I got to know a lot of interesting information about brains and how it works with respect to learning. Also I got to know that we are not doomed the day we are born, we can learn anything we want :) That is really important for me, because I want to try to learn absolutely new subject to me :) Wish me luck :)
it is really a helpful course for me. Learning new subjects effectively and change the leaning materials to long term memory is important in working environment, I think the requirement is not just limited the test in college. Grasping the learning skills and raise the good learning habits is benefit for life
This course has alot of valuable information in it. I was studying memory prior to this and had learned many of the techniques before this course but Learning How to Learn is still and great first step. I'm glad I worked this course and I look forward to building on this foundation with more Coursera courses.
A very well planned course. The videos are short, yet substantial and with very solid science behind. The whole structure of the program is a very good example of how to design an on-line course. I found it incredibly useful both for myself and for designing courses for my University. Very highly recommended.
I never knew I needed a learning reform! After enrolling in this course, I realized that there is something more to learning- it's not just coffee and long evenings. Overall, this course helped me a lot in my academic pursuit of attaining knowledge and internalizing its underlying concepts. Thank you so much.
I recommend this course to everyone! I cannot express in words how much value I gained from this. It's short and packed with excellent information. I am glad to see that some of they ways i have always tackled studying have been studied. Please do yourself a favor and sign up for this. You will not regret it.
I can't tell how much I enjoyed the course and the virtual meetings with Prof. Barbara Oakly and Prof.  Terrence Sejnowski. With all the wisdom and inspiration they shared I am even a happier life-long learner now. What I can give in return is a wholehearted gratitude. This has been a fantastic course indeed!
I was a bad learner all my life and signed up for the course for some useful advices and practices. What I obtained is much more. It is not only about learning methods but also about practices that I can use in my work and private life. The learning materials and tests are very enjoyable. Thank you very much!
This course is awesome! It provides you with all the tools and tricks you need to enhance your learning. No matter what you study, you can take out a bunch of useful tips from this course and start applying it right away.It really helped me master new ideas and concepts quickly and more efficiently.Thank you!
A very informative and eye opening course. Important concepts were discussed in very simple and practical terms. I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning new subjects, skills or languages. The materials discussed in this course will be very useful and will stay with you forever.
As someone who doesn't have the time for a formal education, I try to learn through my everyday experiences, no matter how ordinary or monotonous they may appear.  This course opened my eyes to tips and tricks to make the best of my learning, regardless of the task I happen to be involved in. Thanks for the h
This is an awesome course that might remind you of living and working differently. The materials are well organized in a structured way that is very easy to follow - focus/diffuse mode, pomodoro technique, chunking, memory palace, etc. All these will lead to a fulfilling life if you take the course seriously.
In plain simple words is a perfecly planned and elaborated couse and really helpful.Elaborating a bit more I really think is excellent, every other couse should give a recomendation to start this couse because no mater the subject you intend to learn it will help you. It even helo you to have a healthty life.
This course is very helpful in terms of discovering effective methods of learning (the ones you maybe use at the moment and ones you have never heard of). While taking this course you learn many things about yourself as a person and gives you, as it gave to me, motivation to take new self-learning endeavors!
This is one of the best courses that I have attended in a long time. The course was structured very well and some of the concepts and techniques were very informative and useful. I learned a lot of valuable things and I feel these tips and techniques will come a long way in all my future learning adventures.
The Coursera course, "Learning How to Learn", was an informative and interesting class that helped me gain a deeper understanding of study methods. I was able to reflect on my own study habits and identify which study habits of mine were ineffective. I highly recommend this course for all levels of learners!
A must !Unfortunately the modern educational system ( most of the time in many countries ) is counter-productive.A must-to-take course for students in order to learn better and release anxietyAlso important for teachers so they can bring the best of their teaching experience to students, based on this course
I am glad that I decided to participate in this course. I have learnt quite a lot and have realized the errors I have committed in learning. I would review the videos even after I've finished this course until the ideas really ingrained in my psyche and really practice what I have learnt here in this course.
I am grateful I have had the opportunity to study this course. Each student is able to find valuable information, inspiration and supportive energy in Coursera's course Learning How to Learn created by: University of California San Diego. Taught by: Linda Walker, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
Powerful tools of Neurology, Psychology, the psyche and even human exercise to help you learn about the human brain and its role in learning. A must for anyone who wants to learn how to learn. Thank you Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the other woman involved for this opportunity to learn from the great.
I am pleased with the course content. I learnt many new concepts in the process of learning which I heard for the first time - like chunking, interleaving, einstellung, and memory palace. I will now avoid illusions of competence and will use recall plus deliberate practice in order to learn more effectively.
This course is very helpful to those who doubt themselves and think that learning new subject is way to hard for them, but this course is also effective for those who have an illusion to-know-it-all. It helps in better understanding on how your brain works and how to make it a better instrument for learning.
I have tried to be responsible for my own learning for years since I graduated. And I am always being troubled by the fact that the progress I've made is too slow because of my poor memory. This course offers many useful techniques which I believe will definitely give me a hand to my coming learning process.
This course was fun. Even though most of the techniques presented in it are very simple they are effective. Helped me to organize my work and better focus on single tasks. No secret powerful  sacred tools that will make a superhuman if you are looking for this kind of course. You still need to work a lot :).
This course is fun and educational at the same time, providing hundreds of useful learning techniques, facts and tips. Learning is a life-long process, and I must say that it's Dr. Oakley's personality that largely inspires me to finish the course and have confidence in my future learning. Thank you so much!
I find understanding how we learn very helpful to be an efficient, effective and strategic learner as well as the techniques and strategies for studying, memorizing and beating procrastination. I really love how they explain learning in terms of cognitive pyschology, educational pyschology and neuroscience.
This course has helped me with my learning and my most problematic issue: procrastination! I highly recommend this course to all those people who are learning something, whether it's a new language, or learning how to play baseball. It also is tremendously profitable to those students who have test anxiety.
So many amazing things to become a better learner! At the beginning, it was a little hard to adjust myself in the new way of learning. But DO NOT skip any chapter, you will see everything is connecting. At the end, you will see in yourselves only positive and innovative ways concerning the learning process.
Its an excellent course, which provides you the basics of how to learn and remember in a very logical and sequential manner. Loved the way how instructors keep interest of learners throughout the course.  BEST ONE for learning. Praises and thanks to instructors and complete team involved in it. Best Regards
In this course I realized some errors in my previous study techniques, but now I improved my study habits thanks to this information, which really helped me a lot. It was the first course I completed, because it motivated me a lot, the teachers explain very well. Thank you for sharing your study techniques.
I really love this course. I enjoy learning very much, but after taking this course, I think I can learn new things effectively. I also love the Competence of Illusion of Competence Chapter, for so much things I think I master it, I actually know only the basic and I am on my way to improve that. Thank you!
The concepts mentioned about the diffused and focused mode are just brilliant and a must try. Education would have been so better if someone had taught the concepts taught here. Really good course to learn no matter the age and field you are in. I wish colleges and schools teach this course before anything.
I've never valued tests, nor flash cards, nor anything that I perceived as gimmicky learning tools. Learning was just learning. But I was wrong. Understanding your cognitive behavior and how memories and knowledge are formed has helped me grasp learning in a new intuitive way. I highly recommend the course!
It was my first course at coursera and hopefully not the last one! Many thanks for all of the makers, participants, professors, researchers. I learned a lot of excellent techniques, read, saw, heard a lot of great and inspiring stories. I think I've learned much from you guys! My best regards,Andrew Rákóczy
It provides an essential understanding of how the brain operates when learning, explained in a very pedagogical way, and it gives tools to maximize your learning in every sense. Extremely interesting and useful, I enjoyed it A LOT, I'm successfully using the techniques and telling everyone to do it as well!
YAY! My first online course done with learning how to learn! Well done will use this to chunk the other upcoming online courses. This will serve as basic and fundamental of learning everything I want to learn on the rest of courses. Keep learning effectively for life and explore the world of passion. Kudos!
Very good course, It lets you know how you should really learn any thing very effectively, I appreciate the teachers who made it possible to reach individuals, Dr. Barbara Oakley is now my one of the best teacher and Dr. Terrance Sejnowski thank you for sharing valuable information and your great knowledge.
It was a great course to learn the proper techniques needed for learning in every field and to learn a little about human psychology. I loved the procrastination part because that is the portion in which a person suffers daily .So,to know how to overcome the sense of procrastination is a great thing to do.
Excellent course! Enjoyed learning how to learn. While auditing this course I learned great new techniques how to learn and got the idea of what I was doing wrong before. The great thing about this course is that it allows you to learn while progressing through the course by giving you a lot of mini tasks.
There are some really useful tips for learning efficiently, avoiding procrastination and changing habits that can be applied not only to learning but also to everyday life. I found the lectures very enjoyable and interesting ,as well as the optional extra videos. I highly recommend this course to everyone.
Exceptional tools for life-long learners to use in our journey. Also, it dispelled some learning practices, such as excessive use of highlighting, which can cause illusions of competence. Thank you Barb and Terry for sharing your wisdom and insights and for sharing video interviews of other great learners.
This course was excellent! I learned so much and am already using what I learned in my studies of language and guitar. Thank you to Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski and to Coursera for making this course available. I'm also loving Dr. Oakley's book, "A Mind for Math." She's a great writer and engaging instructor!
One of the few learning skills courses to really hit home. It's not that many new concepts were introduced; so much as that a better understanding of the cognitive and/or neurological processes underlying familiar methods clarified their usefulness and gave them a new importance to me. Very helpful course!
I loved it. I learned a lot, but more than that I ENJOYED a lot. Of course, that in turn helped me learn even deeper. I enjoyed the lessons and the presentation style. And I really loved all the interviews that were optional. I hope to be able to rewatch/relisten to those over and over. Thank you again. :)
It is a great course. I have learned why some techniques are better than others (recall vs highlighting) and how can I learn more effective. But it's not (only) about techniques and tricks. This course explain HOW 'learning' works and WHY it is important to learn effective (see the illusion of competence).
I took up this course out of curiosity... the course is presented in a very intriguing manner, and it boosted my interest in learning. I am grateful to the course team to introduce me to some great minds through the interviews in the optional videos... Looking forward to learning something new each day :)
It was my best experiance with some brilliant teacher staff. I learnt many different best techniques to learn something in a new and best creative way to reach toward the solution. Now i am able to teach the course to other collegues as well who are finding it difficult in learning how to learn. Thanks!!!
Excellent course! Would highly recommend it to anyone, not just students. It was very well thought out and actually taught me how to learn. I enjoyed the videos as they were short, sweet, and straight to the point. I am definitely going to be able to study more efficiently and take tests more confidently.
This is one of the best (maybe the best) course on Coursera, seriously! It applies to EVERYONE, because everyone is LEARNING. This should be your first course on Coursera, so that you learn here how to learn, to apply it on the other courses you want to do on Coursera. Thank you so much Barbara and Terry!
This was a really good first course to take. I learned a lot about how to study in a more effective manner. There were a lot of errors that I was making when studying, which were pointed out to me during the videos and thoroughly explained, while giving better alternatives in the same videos or in others.
I am deeply grateful to all the teachers, experts, and interviewees in this course,  for their knowledge sharing, which will help to strengthen my learning powers. Furthermore, I'll recommend this course for sure to my friends who need to improve their learning competence, one of our life-time capability.
Before I took the course, I was a notorious procrastinator. Afterwards, that's changed drastically as I finally possess the know-how to better deal with it and motivate myself. That along with everything else the course has to offer convinces me that I will do much better on tests and studying in general.
When they say learn powerful mental tool to help you master tough subjects... they meant it! Dr. Barbara Oakley has done a fantastic job at making this course smooth and entertaining. If you put in the effort you will come out with the necessary tools for your lifelong education. What are you waiting for?
I have always thought of myself as a good student.  I like learning, and I'm a teacher.  And being a good student means always looking for ways to improve or seeking solutions for performance gaps and fighting procrastination.  This course (and the book Mind for Numbers) were helpful and easy to complete.
This is a wonderful course that teaches you the right ways of learning. We generally don't pay attention to the learning style we are following, this course makes you aware of more effective techniques which can be applied. Also the information about what is going on in our brains while leaning was great.
I enjoy this course a lot. It helps me understand better about my pitfalls in learning and how to deal with it. The course walks the talk by applying learning technique through out the materials (metaphor and analogy) that makes it easier for participants to understand and really make the knowledge stick!
The graphics and language used in this course are easy to understand, even new terms are well defined through context clues and visual cues. I have already learned and applied so many of the things I've learned and I'm even helping my fiancé get through his graduate classes more effectively this semester.
This course is an eye opener for me on the way I used to learn new things. This is having significant positive impact on my life now and in future. I have learnt lots of powerful tools and methods to improve the way I learn things. Thank you so much for the professors, Coursera team and everyone involved.
I think that this course is something that should be taught and emphasized on early in the college career. It has concepts that are necessary for success. I feel that if this course was available to me when I was in undergrad, I would've excelled much more and probably would've been able to tack on more.
Thank you so much! It has been amazing to watch and read all this scientific content. Not just for students but for anyone who would like to adopt a life long learning habits, this course is a true treasure. I really liked the illustrations and how calmly Barbara presents the material. Thank you so much!
This course concisely debunks every major issue associated with learning.  The professors are engaging, kind, and funny.  Learning How To Learn has inspired the confidence in me to continue my academic career after years away from college.  Thank you so much for making this information available for all!
Excellent (especially Dr Oakley; really easy to listen to, cadence and attitude encouraged me to continue with the course till the end).  Useful tools, useful introduction to the science underpinning the tools and observations.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning something new and complex.
An absolutely life changing course. I am so lucky to have found out about this - not only has it helped to re-spark my passion in learning, it has helped me in my academic career to relearn and understand concepts that were once difficult for me. Thank you to both wonderful teachers for this opportunity!
This is an amazing course. Learning is made very easy by the tools shared in this course. Dear Procrastinators and all others who think they are studying hard, please do this course. Actually each and every person should enrol for this course as it helps improve day to day life. Thank you for the course.
A real masterpiece. Didn't  have high expectations initially. But as the course progressed, I witnessed one of classic training sessions. Right content and terrific presentation. I would highly recommend this course. Being an aspiring writer, this course was highly useful to me. Expecting more in future.
Loved the course. Learned many tricks for learning things fast and understanding them deeply. I'm pretty sure this course has changed how I'm going to learn new subjects/skills in future.If you are planning to make MOOCs or some other skill, then this course is a must to extract more out of limited time.
Every one must study this course, In this course I understand about how my brain works and the scientific way to create the t longerm memory.Learning about chunks , working and diffuse mode of brain , deliberate practice​ , recall , overlearing , illution of competence ,procastination are interesting ...
I thought this course was very informative...and entertaining. The presenters provided a great deal of information in a very easy to understand style and used a variety of examples and videos. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in understanding various methods that can be employed in learni
I learned so many useful things in this class. It's a meta-class. How to learn is not something you see very often. I've shared the link with all my friends. Anyone who thinks of themselves as a lifelong learner, and anyone taking classes after a break away from school, will really appreciate this class.
Amazing MOOC! Barbra makes understanding how the brain works so easy! The course is filled with great examples and with a very easy language. I feel like I learnt stuff that I will use for the rest of my life... so thank you Barbra and the people of Coursera for this great tool for learning how to learn!
The course is really helpful. After learning you will have a general picture on how the brain works(the diffuse mode and the focus mode)(The working memory and the long term memory)(Some basic neuron science)...........I really learned a lot.  Thank you Professor Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski. :)
The only negative thing I can say is that this course was not available when I was younger! I am grateful to Barbara and Terrence and their team for providing such a wonderful learning experience. At 43 years of age I have finally learned how to learn. And this is outstanding thing to say by an educator!
I'd not use the term the best course ever, but instead I must say that this course is one of the greatest and important courses in the Coursera platform. In my opinion, every student regardless of his field of specialization should follow this course to increase the effective learning methods of his own.
As a lifelong procrastinator
without good study habits, I found this course invaluable. It explains good learning
techniques, ways to overcome procrastination and important insights into how
the brain learns. I’ve already incorporated principles from this course in
other subjects with excellent results.
Wonderful course! I was initially hesitant about this course as I thought it would simply rehash material that most people already know, but this is certainly not the case -- even for a post-university grad like myself. The two instructors are enthusiastic, the course is well presented, and very useful.
An Excellent Course. This course has helped me a lot in understanding things better and also introduced various techniques of learning that I was unaware of. Everyone who has trouble understanding the concepts or thinks they have weak memory should try this course. Thank You Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski
Barbara's sequencing of material, interleaving of concepts, and frequent
 use of imagery were immensely helpful in getting me to retain the 
information. This course has fundamentally changed my approach to 
learning & helped me "get out of my own way" when it comes to 
achieving something I care about.
Excellent help for learning how to study new and complicated subjects.  As a mature student retraining in a technical field this helped me take my haphazard textbook reading and understand my specific learning process.   I could then focus and hone my homework and study habits to be much more effective.
I got a very important insight from the course. Teachers gave a lot of useful priceless information that is difficult to just. You can live all your life and never know these important things. Great luck to learn about them on the course and learn from such excellent wise teachers. It's Zen!. Thank You!
Great course! Very informative and helpful for anyone who wants to learn (and teach) better and more efficiently. It is very good structured, and the content is represented in a clear, comprehensive and concise manner. There are a a lot of additional resources which are very good. I highly recommend it!
I like the podomoro strategy. It something I tried duringstudyinf for my last test. I get really distracted so I do other things other than homework but this helped me focus and want to focus so I can feel good about enjoying walking my dog, or checking my phone, or a longer break like watching Netflix.
A great course for shifting your perspective on how to approach learning something new. The course is not too difficult but offers valuable tips on how to use your brain wisely. I learned a lot from it and definitely suggest this to someone who feels like they haven't been the most "successful" student.
An amazing course that teaches you to practice self-knowledge, understanding your bad habits, accepting procrastination and how to stop it, so you can improve your learning skills. I highly recommend this to anyone that want's to learn better, stay motivated not only on college classes but also at work.
This was my first course on coursea and I enjoyed it. I found the material beneficial and useful.I particularly liked the interviews as well; very helpful.I felt that this was a very practical place to start for my first course before embarking on learning new subjects that I've never thought of before.
I really enjoyed this course. The instructors were engaging and fun. The repeated some important points effectively. The jokes and things were a bit silly but very memorable and fun. I would like the ability in the mobile app to be able to pre-download videos and to slightly speed up the playback speed.
Great course!!! The teachers are really really great!! You can see in the videos that they are amazing. A lot of new knowledge.I think everyone who is involve with economics, development and education of course have to take this course. Well, this course will be a huge help to anybody in any field also.
This course is beyond amazing! I really enjoyed learning these programs. And it really helped me a lot in the moment, I'm sure it will bring me more benefits in the coming semester! I'll miss learning this course and I will definately recommand this amazing course to those around me! Thank you so much!
10/10 will recommend to anybody who is trying to learn anything. Doesn't matter if you are a pro player or a beginner you will at least get a better insight to your own thinking. PS: When you reach the climax you will realized that's the same thing the course is trying to teach; "Oppose your Dogmatism"
An eye opening course I will remember forever, glad I took this seriously. Now, looking back to my college days, I can say how inefficiently was I trying hard to learn. I have now clear ideas how should I learn and move forward in life. This definitely is a course for everyone, student or professional.
I found Coursera very beneficial and helpful. It broadened my ways of studying in a way that I feel more confident in my self to get my work done in a more organized and self efficient way and less stressed about taking tests now that I have found good methods to calm my stress when doing so. Thank you
This course has truly changed my take on the studying and learning process. It was structured in a very learner friendly way that scaffolds the information. I have already recommended both Coursera and Learning How to Learn to more than one person and I hope they enjoy this experience as much as I did.
This course opened a lot of my learning mistakes. I'll keep studying with more patience and perseverance, however now, it will be more efficient as i won't drop learning because 'I'm stupid. Everyone else is smarter than me.' and won't listen to others that i cannot accomplish something. Thanks Barbara
Great introduction to current understanding of effective and efficient learning techniques ie. recall, interleaving, spaced repetition, pomodoro etc.. New neurons forming throughout life in the hippocampus (memory) and recess/exercise is the best enforcer of these new memories/learning....as is sleep!!
Great and easy to understand material. The course is easy to follow-through and contains a lot of useful information that you're not likely to learn in depth in most classes at school. The teachers are very experienced and include many examples/real-life situations to help you get through the material.
This course is fantastic. Complicated neuroscience is boiled down and made accessible to a student of any age. The content is described so thoroughly by the professors.  I have learned techniques that I can apply in my own life to improve my productivity, memory, and study habits. So happy to have foun
This is good course to improve your learning skill, we know what should we do to be more effective in learning and better in remember the contents of the lesson or topic that we are learning. Thank you very much to authors for having this great course with clear explanation, guide and concrete example.
This is a game changer. It blew me away to see how just a couple of hours a week for a month could change my approach to learning (and teaching too) so radically and improve it so much. I am deeply indebted to Mrs Oakley and Mr Sejnowski for providing such important knowledge in such an easy going way.
I find this course extremely valuable for me, even though I finished my studies couple of years ago. Now I look at the process of studying from different perspective with very well understanding  the processes involved in understanding and memorizing things. I really recommend this course for everyone!
This course really changed my process of learning , I learned very important things that I didn't know . things that I learned about brain diffuse and focused mode , exercise to create new neurons and pomodora Technic were really interesting and impressive , thanks a lotBest Regards , Maryam Allahverdi
Extremely well done!  Very campy at times, but this really helps make the concepts 'stick'.  Barb practices what she teaches, is very passionate about this subject and is a real inspiration.  I sure wish I had learned this stuff before working through 2 BS and 1 MS!  Am a little sad the course is over.
I have learned so much by doing this course from how to stop procrastinating, to the different types of memory, and not to mention the helpful tips, but I don't wanna get too far into the details of how it helped me, so I think you will just have to try it for yourself. I highly recommend this course.
This was a phenomenally helpful course.  I suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2015 which seriously affected my short-term memory, as well as my spatial and temporal reasoning skills, and Learning How to Learn really helped me in terms of finding new compensatory strategies.  I took the course twice!
Brilliant course! I learned some new lessons and also reinforced my good learning habits. It also made me reflect on my learning Journey from high school to undergrad and the advice here perfectly matches my experience. I will be starting a masters degree this summer and the advice here will be handy.
Excellent self paced class. The videos are very interesting and I found myself watching more than I intended to do in one sitting. Loved the quizzing after each module that made sure I understood the information before I moved on. Thank you Barbara Oakly and Dr. Sejnowski for your wonderful teachings!
Absolutely recommend this to anyone trying to improve their learning efficiency. Lots of great techniques and information about how the brain works and how to improve its abilities. The interviews give valuable insight from prominent academics on their habits and way of thinking that makes them great.
A truly outstanding course! I wish I knew all about all these techniques when I was at school and university, let alone having such supportive and knowledgable teachers! I look forward to receiving Barbra's email every Friday, they are jam packed full of useful resources. Highly recommend this course.
This is the most exciting course that I studied in my life! Now I know how to improve the quality of my self-education. Also this course will help me as a teacher of mathematics to make classes more and more interesting and understandable for my students. Thank you so much for this unique opportunity!
This is a wonderful school. Would highly recommend it to all students and more importantly all teachers at all levels. I am hoping to use these great learning tips in my class and students. Hope to translate it to my native language of Odiya so that more people can be exposed to these important ideas.
Many things in here should really be taught in fundamental higher level education courses. Although some of the videos are outdated, the concepts are not. Barbara does a pretty good job explaining things and even using the course and tests themselves to showcase how well some of these techniques work.
A great course for helping you understand how your mind works. I have learned that learning need not be something laborious but rather it can be a fun journey with the right tools and techniques. I look forward to applying what I have learned to all aspects of my life, not just in my formal education.
Among the many valuable lessons, I have learned in this course is the power of the brain when you recognize, nourish and use it. Some techniques existed passively in my life but now I use them intentionally to learn and be creative. It's been an insightful journey, Am glad I have learnt how to learn.
It is so refreshing to get all these explanations, given with so much dedication and kindness.These are things we should learn from the start, at school, instead of being given wrong clues about how to enjoy learning. Actually, this courses proves it is possible (and shows how to make it). Thank you.
I found this course incredible. It was organized in a way that practiced what it taught - a mixture of logical lessons, stories, and examples. I'm beginning medical school soon and am so grateful to the creators of this course for giving me a foundation of tools before I begin the journey. Thank you!
This class has been fantastic in teaching me the different ways the brain works to learn/absorb and remember new areas of interest. It was my first class I signed up for on Coursera and I'm so glad I took it. I've gotten so much from it, thank you guys!! It has been wonderful learning about learning.
This is a very good course. It shows valuable insights on how our brain works and how to utilize to its full potential. This course also provides lot of valuable techniques which can be applied irrespective of domain. I think every student must go through this course and apply the methods prescribed.
I enjoyed the course very much. The lecture videos and reading materials were very easy to understand. This  course will change your entire perspective on learning and make it a rather enjoyable process.I recommend it  to everyone out there keen on effective learning, regardless of the field of study
Awesome! I took this course together with my 3 children, Ethan Lee (13), Claryn Lee (10) and Jolynn Lee (8) and we believed it was and will prove to be beneficial for all! Thanks so much Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski and the Learning How To Learn Team!! God Bless, from Eric Lee, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
I really liked the course. It was accessible, and the pedagogy was great. Whether or not I will use the techniques I don't know, but I definitely feel I have gotten a theoretical insight into the neurological processes surrounding learning and the practical ways to enhance these processes. Thank you!
This course really helped me learn better. From diffused modes to how to avoid procrastination, they also love to bring humor into what they are talking about. For example, they talk about zombie modes and your octopus modes. So for whoever wants to learn learning better, this is the course for you.
I find the course to be beneficial and can be applied immediately to my learning. I particularly like the memory techniques and the ways to overcome procrastination. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand more about the learning process and the neurological background to it.
This class was a delight to learn cos Dr. Oakley was very methodical and joyful in teaching. Highly recommended! :) I now have a better appreciation for learning and looking forward to apply all in my daily life. Thank you Coursera and Dr Barbara Oakley for this wonderful course! Much appreciated :D
It's a great course to learn how to learn, literally. Certain techniques I used to use were also mentioned during the course. Most importantly, I learned a lot more and new ways on improving my learning skill. I would like to revisit course materials when I "hit" the wall during my learning process.
Life lessons that should be taught in schools. The basic skills that everyone needs. I (med student) am grateful to all the people who made this possible. Thank you. Special thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and people behind the scene who made this course possible and accessible.
Great course with powerful information. This was assigned for my summer math class and was not given a good time window to complete, so I had to cram it in(funny because that is very contradictory to the material. I will keep refreshing myself on the notes I took and attempt to teach others with it.
Magnificent. It helped me really understand why certain techniques had worked for me over the years, and which techniques I should learn and hone to improve my learning. I found Dr. Oakley's story especially motivational, and have been inspired to try and learn more than I thought myself capable of.
Thank you really much for this awesome course! I only wish that I had seen it earlier, 6 years ago, when I began my university studies. This year I am finishing my Masters degree in Computer science. I strongly believe that this gained knowledge will help me for my whole remaining lifetime learning.
I started this course not knowing what I'll be getting, not knowing if it will succeed in improving the way I learn and my life overall. Now, that uncertainty cleared out and I know for sure that this course did it for me. Now I'm learning new things everyday and actually getting values out of them.
First off, the course brought to me many new ideas about learning. Secondly, the exercises reinforced many of those ideas. As a result, I now have a much better shot at being an effective learner. Having said that, our results will only be good if we "deliberately" apply what this course teaches us!
This has been very well put course about improving one's learning skills.

Even though most of the subjects might have been somewhat familiar to me as a psychology MA It was still very helpful in a learning context.

Definitely worth spending your time on this to improve your capabilities to learn!
By far the best course i have ever seen. Excellently structured and this course motivated me to think a lot about myself, for example i am practicing pomodoro technique. For the first time in my life, I published an article on Medium because of the final assignment being given in the honors section
This Course really helped me to learn a lot of new things and look at the process of learning from a very different perspective. Thank You Coursera and I would also like to  thank Dr.Terrence Sejnowski and Prof. Barbara Oakley for their Valuable inputs and Efforts to pull off this wonderful course.
This course has been comprehensive, enlightening, inspiring, and useful. It was well-presented and well-structured. Your learning builds upon itself as you go through the course. I found myself easily digesting lessons, immediately applying the strategies, and finishing the course in half the time.
I find myself using the techniques I learned in this course not only when I'm trying to learn new things, but also when I'm trying to strengthen my ability to create and write. I recommend the course to everyone who is committed to expanding life skills, academic skills, or any other learning goal!
This course will change my life.  I having been using all the methods that I shouldn't. Only through this course, I could find correct methods that are efficient and reliable. Huge thanks to the professors who put their time and energy into this course. Thanks for teaching us learning how to learn.
EXCELLENT
course – Dr. Barbara Oakley explains very well (it is really helpful she is so
calm but, at the same time, excited about what she is teaching!) and she gives
a lot of good examples, so that we can understand more deeply where to apply
the techniques she talks about. I highly recommend it!
This is a wonderful course for students and educators alike.  I teach kindergarten ESL, but I've been able to put into practice much of what I learned about learning to help my students learn more and remember it longer.  Plus, this course has helped me to rekindle my own lifelong love of learning.
Great course! It helps to formalize best learning practices and become a good learner. You'll find out what Pomodoros and interleaving are, how to understand and remember newly learned material better with less effort, how to procrastinate less. Thanks to whole LHTL team for such great information!
If you struggle with your university/high school workload, I highly recommend you to take this course. It helps you to design better strategy to enhance your study and to cope with subjects that you dislike. The course also introduces ideas which definitely help you become a more productive learner
This should be required material for all young students. Of course, it will help "life learners" and anyone who likes to challenge (or must challenge) their minds regularly. I just wish I had taken this course in middle school, as the rest of my life would have been much easier and more productive.
I love Barbra Oakley! She's funny, creative intelligent & I love that she uses her own experience (& I'm assuming her daughter) as examples to help understand the connecting of dots. I'm learning a lot of valuable information in this course that I fully plan on using as I continue educating myself.
I have learned a lot from this course on how to become a much better learner and how to beat procrastination, as far as i have seen all of the techniques i have learned in this course are extremely effective and has drastically influenced and changed my way of thinking and the perception of things.
I didn't finish the course.... For one simple reason, I became so enamoured with the teacher's way of explaining that I purchased the book. I am currently looking through the suggested books in the suggested reading parts of the course. Thank you for a great content course both in content and form!
It indeed provides the efficient methods of learning.Now, I just focus on several 25-minute study time per day while the topics of the study time vary.Meanwhile, I learn to grab the knowledge step by step in accordance with a long-tern learning plan,in a word, to learn earlier and little by little.
This course is fantastic. It gives you lots of information about the learning process and the way our brain works. Prof. Oakley and Prof. Terry are amazing, you think they are so close to you that you think you love them. All the information is well documented with research. Highly recommended !!!
it's a wonderful trip to go over this course, the two professors are so much kind and supportive during the time. And the course material is just way too right in the place even common folks  could easily grasp the ideas and are convinced by the reliable facts. It brings me a really pleasant enjoy
Hands down, one of the best courses I've ever taken. I am not only comparing it to MOOCs but to graduate-level courses taught in renowned universities. Thank you Dr. Oakely and Dr. Sejnowski for sharing your years of knowledge and insight with us. I can't wait to start your next course, Mindshift.
Amazing. Simply amazing. Debunked so many myths about studying and learning that we have been struggling with all our lives. Alongside, so many resources to learn well and become better at what you do- whatEVER you pursue! I'm glad I took this course. Thank you Professors Barbara and Dr. Terence!!
Fabulous.  Most meaningful and powerful course I have taken in years.  A must.  A critical must.  Only wish this existed when I was much younger and about to embark on my educational journey.  Still valid and relevant.  Bravo-exceptional presentations, science, and lectures.  Thank you, thank you.
I loved this course, I think everyone should take Learning
How to Learn before starting high school or college. It would make a lot of
difference in how they approach education and Learning. It is a good source of
motivation to know that with enough effort and perseverance, anyone can be a
genius.
It is a great course that worth to take. Both instructors will share with us tips and simple tricks. I like the optional interviews after each topic that bring people with different backgrounds to share with us about how to learn. You will definitely able to more valuable tools and be open-minded.
I found the course really interesting. The outlay of how the course is presented is really dinamic and keeps you focus on the task. Teachers are easy going and the forum is full of students aiming to learn and help others. It has been a pleasure to be part of the activity.Greetings from Spain! Ana
I am thankful to Barbara Oakley for her research on"Learning How to Learn" and giving it away for people like me. Because of this course I was able to debunk my myths regarding learning which always ran around my head. I am thankful to every single people who worked to get this course on coursera.
Really terrific class and material. I savored each lecture and found myself excited to come back for more every week. This is a great class to take concurrently with any other class on Coursera or in general - it gets you excited and well-prepared for the common pitfalls of learning something new.
One of the best courses I've ever taken. Wish I'd had a class like this in high school or college -- I would have pursued a degree in science instead of the liberal arts. I will be assigning this class to my son next summer before his junior year in high school. Thank you for a wonderful resource!
I wish I had taken this course 25 or so years ago.  I have started using several of the techniques taught in this course, including Pomodoro technique, and am already seeing improvements in my use of time, along with various other techniques from the course helping with retention and understaning.
I have to thank Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for an excellent course. I follow the scrip with the video and practice the recall every time and I do think are a great value for everyone . I wish I new what i know now when I went to college, it would have been easier for me . Thank you . OG
The course has given me a lot of strategies to overcome some problems that i have when it comes to learn and doing things, of course that its up to one if he or she is committed enough to try the techniques thaught in here. But the course has filled a lot of my expectatives.Thanks to all the staff
The course is short but you get to learn a lot about how memory works, best study and learning practices and how to manage your time.The videos are short and quiz you at the end, so it's very easy to keep your focus.I would advise taking this course, even if you aren't a student anymore (like me).
All of the techniques presented in the course are essential to succeeding in whatever you are trying to learn.  I bought the companion book to reinforce the ideas from the videos and it followed the outline perfectly.  Looking forward to applying these learning tools to future courses at Coursera.
One of the best courses ever!!!! So much important and helpful tips, wonderful specialists and Dr. Oakley is a perfect lecturer - during this short videos she just wonderfully "inserted" all those ideas in my head! Thank you for the wonderful topic, for the great research and the best lecturer!!!
I really enjoyed the class.  As a 53 year old that's been out of the class setting for a very long time, this class has provided me with much needed confidence.  Even if I never step foot in another class, this course even provide skills and techniques for the work setting.  Thank you Dr. Oakley!
im very proud of finishing this fantastic course. it could jump me a new step of how learning something new, once im a english language student so concluded it was really grantedfull. People like you can make the world more smart and less silly. thanks im looking for forward to start another one.
I feel this course gave me a solid foundation on how to tackle my education. Before, I knew some of the methods taught here, but didn't realize their importance and simply neglected using them. On top of that, the lessons were concise and interesting, which made them easy to follow. Great course!
Very simple, but at the same time very important course for everyone. Helps to understand many things that happen in our life. I'm ashamed to admit, but I did not know some things. The course is well formed in the overall picture of the worldview and self-knowledge, and will be useful to everyone
I cannot think of a single person I know that wouldn't highly benefit from taking this course. Learning is what differentiates us from the dead. And this course lessons can be applied in all areas of our lives. I am recommending it for every one. This should be a required course for all teachers.
I liked very much the course. Is a life change course, that will help me not only in my academic preparation, but in my daily tasks and in my job. I appreciate very much the way this course is granted. Thanks to the teachers and the way the course is produced (the videos are great!). Best, Maggie
Awesome course. These mental tools are really helpful!Thanks a lot!__________If English is a foreign language for you and you have never learned smth in English, but want to - this is a good course to start and to get such an experience. After it will be much easier to study some special subject.
This course provides lots of meaningful and useful knowledge about human's brain structure and working mechanism, focused and diffuse thinking modes, and memory, and techniques to tackle procrastination and illusion of completion,  anyone can learn a lot from it regardless the background and age.
I just could not stop watching the videos! This course is the perfect example of a well-designed online content, because it goes straight to the point, gives you tips on how to apply the knowledge according to your own needs and possibilities and opens the door to further exploration. I loved it!
I really enjoyed this class. I typically don't have trouble learning new subjects, but I was able to bring quite a few of these techniques to my everyday work life. I now know when I am procrastinating because the process of something seems really hard.Thank you, I tell everyone about this class.
The course was just amazing!Short videos containing that allow the student to focus and don´t lose attention. One of the best online classes I´ve done!Barbara is really good in explaining and show an enthusiasm for the subject that makes the student feel more will to sit and listen to the videos!
I am a 55 year old learner with two advanced degrees and I have struggled. My hope is that more people get exposed to your work. It has the power to ease suffering and end unnecessary battles with self confidence. It may even keep many from giving up.  Thank you for your generosity and knowledge.
This should be a mandatory class for all high and university students.  I wish I knew about this when I was at that age.  It changed my learning habits and I am sure it will help my future studies and my life!Approach and sell this course to your target audience.  So there is your marketing idea!
loved every single thing taught in the course, would love to use them in my learning process from now on. thanks to the wonderful professors who have taught the course so beautifully and for actually bringing the idea for such a wonderful and effective course. this was a nice experience overall.
This is the best course I have taken on Coursera. It is immensely fun, immediately practicable, is 'chunked' according to what it teaches, and possesses the perfect blend of head and heart. I picked up many useful skills and values, and highly recommend this course to everyone regardless of age!
This has been a very insightful class. I have learned on how my brain works, which gives me a better chance to make better use of my natural abilities, mental skills and resources.It has catalyzed my momentum towards learning and torn down some mental blocks that had followed me since childhood.
Very interesting course to understand how our brain is working with new information and materials.Got several unknown technics to improve my ability to learn.
Authors did a good job and try to motivate their students to keep learning in future.
It was pleasant to invest my time into this course.
Its just amazing. I am so motivated by doing the course that I want to start doing something new, do something which was there in my bucket list but was suffering from procrastination. I am thankful to the reverend professors for showing me to learn and do new things.Profound regards, Coursera!!
This course is fantastic. I feel like it's the best place to start if you want to get the most out of learning whatever skills you want to acquire. The lessons are simple, yet enlightening. You can begin using the techniques immediately after learning them and really see the difference it makes.
This course is a must for everyone! i used to procrastinate a lot but the habit starts to change as I learn the basic concept of our brain. This course really helped me to change the way I learn and understand new materials, how I study efficiently and effectively without having to force myself.
Great class! They explained how to use helpful learning tools to help retain information and stick to a schedule to avoid having a negative relationship with school and study and combat procrastination.  I enjoy school so much more, I retain more information and I have all A's so far! Thank you!
This was amazing. A lot of practice, a lot of practical ideas. At fist I was a bit prejudices to the lecturers but in a few days I liked them very much. I use this "focused-diffuse thinking" approach a lot lately to remember the things I was trying to remember. Also I like additional interviews.
This course helps to unlock my brain and prepares me for life learning process. I believe it will do the same to everyone. I recommend that you start your learning process by learning how to learn. It lights up my brain and shows me that there are spaces in my brain for things that I never knew.
As an experienced vocational education teacher, this course has highlighted many concepts and ideas that I can pass on to my students to help them pass the course I am teaching. It has also opened my eyes to misconceptions and mistakes I am making in my own studies towards a Master of Education.
Right now, I am starting the last course week, but I am totally in love with all I have been learning.I recommend everyone to read Dr. Barbara's book along with the course. It really helps deepening the learning.Thank you very much for the possibility of learning from such high level professors.
This course helps me to understand better how the brain function and accept information. It gives me a new perspective on teaching.I hope everyone will have an opportunity to be part of this course. I am suggesting this course to parents and teachers who could teach their children how to learn.
!

Excellent course! The instructors are very experienced and kind. All the tips and concepts are very important and all professionals at any discipline must learn them. I will definitely take their next course: "Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential"
Excellent course - I recommend it! Why don't they teach this stuff in school? It's practical information that will serve you over your lifetime. A good chunk of the material is techniques you may already be doing or heard of but there's enough in here to walk away with new ideas and new habits.
This course is fantastic, it has opened up my creative side and although it is early days, I believe it can only get better. Having completed the course, a lot of the material feels familiar to me, possibly because it makes so much sense. I believe that it will help me in many areas of my life.
Every student needs to take this course so that they can cut through the nonsense out there about studying and improve their own study habits. Ditch highlighters, learning styles, supplements (except ritalin...amazing stuff) and be open and honest with oneself about ones appaling study methods.
Loved this course! Although I was familiar with many things they discussed in the course, like the Pomodoro method many others may not be. I liked the summary of helpful tips in the fourth week and honestly it's a very simple course to complete. Definitely worth the 2-3 hours per week workload.
This was a very useful and enjoyable course. It didn't take too much time to complete the weekly responsibilities and it was worth every minute of it. The course structure made it easy to understand and recall the material. I will definitely use it to advance my studies and in my everyday life.
It was a beautiful experience. The course was designed brilliantly by Barbara Ma'am and Terrence Sir and hopefully I would be able to implement all the techniques taught by them in my daily education. It will go a long way in motivating me to learn new and challenging things. Thank you so much!
This course is great course that everyone must pass it before other courses and learning subjects. With this course I know how brain works and what I can do for best performance in study, thinking and learning. Thanks for support Persian language and adding subtitle for videos. You are the best
Very good and quick course, which gives you some hints on what you can improve in your approach to studying. It's a valuable resource of learning advice and mechanisms which allow your mind to learn. It's a great subject to study not only as a fundamental for other studies, but also on its own.
How to Learn is perhaps the most relevant skill for anyone at any age. More than anything, our capacity to learn is what allows us to move with the increasing pace our world is running today.  Thank you so much Barbara and Terrence! This is definitely one of the most priceless lessons I've had!
This course was very much fun and has excellent learning materials. Everyone should learn this techniques to enhance/improve their method of learning. It would be better if such type of courses are taken during the school days so we all can improve accordingly but it is never too late to learn.
Very well structured course and the concepts were explained in a very simple manner and in layman terms!! Thanks to the professors, especially Barbara Oakley for her simplistic teaching style and her explanations were like flowing water which just flows directly into our brain.. Thanks a lot!!
This course is very short, and I think Coursera itself should prescribe this to anyone using their site. The learning material is invaluable and will make you better at learning and love the process for the rest of your life. Brilliant stuff. Wish my Uni taught this to me in my first semester.
It a great material to learn how to learn.Helped me understand my ability to learn and nurture it in future with all the technique were taught during the course.I tried all the technique, and got the great result out of it.Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and Coursera Team.
This is amazing course for all who want to know the answers "Why repetition is so important?", "How I can learn more information?", "What prosseses inside my brain helps me to learn", "How I can be a better learner?" and many others. Very helpful! Moreover, the teachers is adorable! Thank you)
As a learning program manager, this course was helpful to understand proven approaches that can help me design better .  It was also helpful to me personally; while I am not enrolled in formal education, I am constantly learning new things, and there were some good takeaways for me personally.
This course is incredible! I'm now aware of so many things that will make me a better learner. I wish I knew all these things during my college years. But I still have many opportunities to apply this knowledge. Thanks to Dr. Oakley and everyone who participated in the creation of this course.
Everybody teach something, noone teach you how to learn until now. It's the biggest mistake that doing teachers and people who try to spread the knowledge they don't teach you how to learn. Thanks for that great lesson you give me, i hoped someone had saw me the way of learning things earlier.
Fantastic course, exactly what I was after in terms of something that would improve my learning going forward. Lots of strategies and techniques that are helpfull as well as great information on how our minds work. A lot of thought and work went into this course and I can't recomend it enough.
The key issues have been presented in a clear and well structured way. I liked a humorous approach to sometimes complex ideas underlying the physiology of our brains. The course helped me to understand better what it takes to truly understand things and how to maintain a "hygiene" of learning.
This was a wonderful course. It has helped me to see the mistakes that I have made in studying through out my life. I hope to use all of this new found knowledge to improve my study habits and make better use of my time and my brain. I want to thank everyone that has made this course possible.
It is very great to learn this coures,beacuse it can help us have correct understanding of learning。Besides，this course gives us many great methods to learn well。I think these tips will help me have achievements inthe future study.Also Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski are very cool.
Great course on learning.I've been trying to learn new things in my spare time and often find the effectiveness of my time spent is left wanting. The knowledge just doesn't seem to stick.This course has helped me understand some of the brain's hard wiring and how we can learn more effectively.
I really love that course, it help me a lot when I face with difficulties in my daily life. I highly recommend everyone who wants to improve yourself and learn new things even you're not a student. Hope everyone who want to get progress and change their life choosing this course! Good Luck :D!
Excellent course which uses concepts and insights from a broad variety of sciences to teach students how to learn. Probably the best course I ever took on Coursera and something people in all walks of education - be it at school, university or later in life - would greatly benefit from taking.
This course is just amazing,barbara oakley is fabulous ,the way she teaches in a polite and humble way,i liked it very much and thank you coursera very much,it is coursera that provided a platform where anyone from anywhere in the world can learn anything.thank you coursera and barbara oakley.
I thouroughly enjoyed this course. I found the lectures and the visual tools engaging and have been incoporating some of these ideas into my routines with great success. I have also been sharing some of what I've learned with the students I work with as a Learning Support Assistant. Excellent!
An excellent course which provides the perfect foundation for anyone's learning journey in any discipline. This also helped boost my confidence in  tackling both old and new concepts so that I can better understand and ingrain this understanding to be a better learner, and also better person.
It is a pretty easy course that provides you with ample of invaluable information on learning! Even if you think you know a lot about learning, you can still take away something from it and/or review the information you already know! It is a quick and easy course with wonderful tips! Take it!
This was an excellent course.  I will be revisiting my notes for a while so I can recall the information here when I need it. I learned a lot and I have already used some of the techniques.  Heads up I found it before I found it's companion course which is geared toward working professionals.
this course is one of the best courses out there. everyone regardless their ages should take this course and teach people the techniques that in the course as it shares the way of a lot of things that we do without knowing the reason and the things we shouldn't do when we are learning things.
To be honest, this was a great course to do if you're thinking about going back to school and have been away from it for a while, it has useful tips and tools to help you tackle what you might have problems with regarding with studying or learning, but also helps with everyday things as well.
This course has both solidified what I've already experienced in positive learning outcomes, as well as taught me a diverse set of techniques, strategies, and skills for improving my learning, thinking, and test-taking abilities.Thank you to everyone who made this course possible - and Free!!
It's a very helpful course that provides you with an overview of how your brain functions among many other interesting things. Doing this course you will learn how to improve your learning process and make your life better. I recommend it. Thanks, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
Absolutely amazing, this diffuse and focus mode thing was really new to me, also ending procrastination techniques, and now know more about the importance of exercising, and what I've never known about this thing called the "impostor syndrome" it helped a lot! thank you for this great course.
Wonderful for learning learning techniques. It was a pleasure to take this course. I've already noticed a great difference in the way I study (I'm a PhD student); I do it now in a way that allows me to retain the information I need to move forward with my work. I highly recommend this course!
Thank you very much for puthing your time and effort in creating this course. I've learned new tricks and recognized some great learning practise I've used when I'd have learned for my college degree. I think that technics from this course should be taught in schools. :)Thank you, once again.
This course helped me grasp the fundamentals of cognitive sciences as they can be applied to learning. Course introduces helpful concepts regarding working of the brain, attention, procrastination and memory. As someone from social sciences background, this course was a refreshing experience.
This course helped me a lot throughout lifelong learning process. From Exercise to deliberate practice, procrastination, focused and diffuse mode, task-management, chunking, memory palace, pomodoro technique and many more... Thank you so much to Dr. Barbara Oakley  and the whole team of LHTM.
This course provides an easy method to learn and score well in our institutions.......This is appliable for all ages.....Maybe from the age of 6 till 50....After completing this course, you will find yourselves scoring well in your institutions......I was really inspired......So will you.....
Outstanding! I have been an educator and consultant for decades, but this course taught me new things about how to learn effectively and how to be productive. The references are valuable too. Every learner and every parent of a learner will benefit from learning how to learn with this course.
Essencial for learners. This course give me not only a big picture of how our brains work, based on neuro-scientific study, but also beneficial techniques to learn brand-new thing without giving up.  Strongly Recommend for everyone who wants to learning something new and accomplish your goal.
I wish I had known the ideas in this course a decade ago! A brilliant course that offers the student the opportunity to learn real, practical, science-based techniques to understand their mind and improve their learning. A thousand thanks to both Professors for creating Learning How to Learn.
Surprisingly useful. This course title may deceive you into thinking it is only self-help "bullsh*t", but actually it is highly fundamented on solid scientific concepts, and, more important: what this course teaches you REALLY WORKS. Everybody should embrace the concepts this course presents!
I am very happy i took this course, whilst not in university or school i have taken the topics and teachings and applied them to my career. I'm an engineer and feel i now have the tools to take the masters i have been afraid to take. really good points, very easy to apply. Suitably impressed.
With this course I learned the do's and don't of studying. I remembered how  I think of myself as a dumb person way back in college when the truth is I just did a lot of wrongdoings in learning. I now gave great importance to sleep and exercise as part of learning.Thanks for the LHTL team. :)
It was good to know areas like Illusions of competance, Einstellung, Imposter Syndrome etc.It will help course takers to become aware of the problems in learning.Thanks to the instructor in visually explaining the concepts and for including interviews with field experts as part f this course!
Really an excellent course!!!! A must do course for students in their learning phase. This course really has very good ideas and techniques from the student's point of view. The discussions in this course will definitely help the students to improve in the studies and learn very effectively.
I recommend any people you must take this course after learning any topic because this course is very useful I learn more about how I learn any new topic and best ways to improve my mind and brain I know a lot of information help me to finish any course, how can any person improve the brain.
if you really want to master your study or want to get great marks in exams because i used and i got great marks in my exams that is why i want to insist you to go to this course if you want to successful in your life because WHEN YOU LEARN BETTER SO YOU CAN  EARN BETTER  ...................
Amazing course. I want to thank Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and all others who were involved in putting together this course. Very useful techniques have been shared throughout the course and I highly recommend everyone to give this course a whirl, because you won't regret it.
it actually confirmed some of my opinion when I was a student. Like I always doing something at night before sleep and find it help after one night sleep, just no theory at that time and I acutally did some "trick" this course teached. It feel really good, my our practice get confirmed here.
The course delivers what the title tells.Concise, well structured modules with a good mix of science (e.g. how the brain works 101 on memory and learning), learning techniques and tips (e.g. battle procrastination, how to prepare for tests).Overall an enjoyable experience and worth the time.
this course has inspire me in many ways. I love learn new things and I always find difficulty in maintaining material and or digging more about the material.I believe I can use the knowledge from this course to eliminate my issues in learning new things.thank you for your wonderful knowledge
Excellent course. Lovely teachers giving a straight foward and high quality class. Its a course for everyone, and i really recommend it for anyone who'd like to understandig how our brains work in the process of learning, and for those who wants to learn how to learn in a more effective way.
This course is full of important and useful information to aid with learning, I have taken away a tonne of practical lessons from this course that are applicable in many aspects of life, not just learning. The instructors are knowledgeable and make the course enjoyable, thanks a lot guys : )
Great course: intersesting topic, made easier by people whose expertise is obvious and yet, these teacher are in no way pedantic. I know now how to help my pupils learn and I feel more confident in my teaching. Thanks a lot for teaching me how to learn and helping me improve my own teaching.
I usually do lots of MOOCs but Learning how to learn is the best one I have ever done. It has made me be more focus on my studies and be more effective using differents simple techniques taught  in this course.I would do it over and again to have deeper knowledge about the best way to learn.
Everyone would have their own approaches/tools to learning. I feel that this course would help one to confirm if the approaches/tools they use is really helping them ?  And also, it would help one to equip with several more approaches that others in the world use for learning. Keep learning!
Excellent course, it takes you to a very easy going course with constant use of  the tools to reinforce the facts that those same tools are the ones needed to learn faster and better. Highly recommended for young students in their degree careers. Tools for the restless mind of many of us!!!!
Great scientific tips on how to study better. The course itself is prepared with these tips, so we will (thankfully) have a hard time to forget the metaphors, analogies and visualizations presented during the course. There's also some interesting interviews to learn more from amazing people.
It is a valuable course filled with ideas that are crucial for all serious learners to learn more effectively. Backed with the most recent research, the additional interviews that complement the ideas presented in the course from expert learners make the course more meaningful and profound.
This course definitely help you to achieve your goals by giving you specific tips to help you step up your learning methods. Recommending this course to everyone who wants to achieve something in their life but are too lazy or don't know how to proceed. Good luck everyone with this course!!
I am 32 and still find this course very useful. It can be useful for a high school student or PhD student, or someone like me who just want to keep learning. The neuroscience facts are very useful although short, and the techniques to train memory and work on procrastination are also great.
This course is a must.  The quantity of content is manageable and something that can be completed quickly.  The subject matter is relevant and helpful to anyone.  The teachers are passionate, knowledgeable, entertaining and impressive.  I look forward to taking Barb and Terry's next course!
Amazing. These were practically things I have learned throughout my successful academic career by trial and error but it was absolutely eye-opening to see that these are actual, recognized techniques. Obviously I did not know all of these techniques, so the course was instructional as well.
This course was one of the most helpful courses I encountered. I really helped me in learning how to learn properly. Techniques like the Pomodoro-Technique are now a great asset to my arsenal! I feel more achieved and I know how to get myself out of a slump and remotivate myself. Thank you!
A very complete course to understand and grab the different tools and techniques to improve learning skills. Even if I knew some of the stuff, it's always good to freshen the memory and understand why something works or not. Thank you very much for this materials that everyone should learn!
The course is like a pleasant journey that I can strongly recommend to all young individuals-those who want to be increasingly effective in either studying or working. This is Learning You How to Learn!  Many thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for their nice presentation.
This course has been an extra ordinary journey of ourselves. The tools and techniques are very helpful in day to life. Moreover, we could make enormous change in our's and other's life. Because, teaching others is the best way to learn. A big round of applause for the complete team of LHTL.
We always are in a learning process, although we sometimes don't really know how is excactly that process of learning. Throught this course you will be able to learn a lot of useful techniques that you can use when learning something. I really recommend it to everyone. Go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!
The field I am in needs constant learning and updates. Before this course i was not confident and a little scared to update myself, but after the techniques learned in this course i am confident about future learning. Thanks to Barb and her team also Coursera bringing us such a good course.
An excellent course in understanding simple techniques to improve the learning process. I use these methods of learning to overcome the innate prorastination I go through on a regular basis. I would like to thank Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for sharing this wonderful course with the world.
Love love loved this course - read the corresponding book and recommend both to anyone who will listen. I have implemented many of the techniques not just in my own learning and time management efforts - but for my crew at work. The follow up material keeps the learning going - Great stuff!
Very usefull course if you do not know anything about how the learning process works, how your brains works, what are the common problems to tackle when you are trying to study something hard and how to overcome them with easy and different techniques. ln general fulfilled my expectations.
I really liked this course ! I learned so much with it and I can't wait to apply everything I learned- I already started applying some things. I highly recommend following this course. I learned so much about how my brain works and what to do to be more efficient and learn in a better way.
Very helpful to others out there. It will increase your efficiency on learning new subjects and brining more stronger concept or theory of it applying all the materials or tools and methods discussed in the video. Well done especially to the instructors involved. They explained it so well.
Thank you for creating an encouraging class. Learning, facts and science is invaluable, but without encouragement, being pursistant and confident when learning it is very hard to stay productive and learn to the best of the brain's potential. Thank you I look forward to the follwing weeks.
Great course! There are a lot of practical techniques and tools introduced in the course. Also, the professors explained the science behind some common behaviors or feelings. Hopefully I am forming a better learning habit. At least I am handling procrastination according to the videos now!
This course is great!  It's very helpful and useful to me.  When I use the technique "Pomodoro" , It did help me finished the works I procrastinate for some times. It worked. There are many other techniques in this course are waiting for you to discover.  Hope you enjoy learning like I do.
This is by far the best course I have taken on Coursera. It reminds me of the techniques that I have long been abandoned and introduces intriguing part on improving myself. This one is simply brilliant. I will definitely recommend this course to any full-time undergraduate student to take!
A wonderful course to get you out of a study rut and bust your inefficient study habits. The instructors, Barb & Terry, were sweet, friendly and very reassuring. Loved the course and would recommend it to anyone in the need of some motivation and tips for the next big test they're taking!
This is an inspiring journey. I highly recommend it to anyone who has crises of faith when seeking out new knowledge that is within your reach but just lingering out of your grasp.  If it were up to me I'd make it compulsory for everyone who joined the full-time workforce every 12 months.
You can learn a lot about the learning process and how to learn more efficiently.  It worths to take this course, the benefits are great if one applies the methods and techniques show through the course. And being aware of how your brain works in the learning process is also very helpful.
I wish i had this information when i was at university. but now that i have it, i will apply several techniques for my everyday learning tasks. Mostly for work. I also want to transmit some of them to my little daughter when she start school, so learning effectively will be a way of life.
This really helped me tackle procrastination and get excited about my work. It helped me improve focus that now helps me focus so much better and get so much out of my day. I no longer have to work longer; instead this has taught me to work smarter and get more done. Very valuable course!
I don't know what to say. I am so happy! This is an eye opener. If you really want to improve in your life and career then this is the first thing that you must consider. The course has broaden up mind with much significant information and skills that I will need to face my future giants.
This course is very useful for re-establishing what you already know about learning, for grasping fresh and new ideas and perspectives on learning and it is also useful for establishing a new "learning practice" or breaking bad learning habits. I have enjoyed it and I highly recommend it!
Great course! A lot of simple concepts, ideas, and tips on how to learn more effective!Wish I knew all of this back in school or university...Bought a book as well to get more ideas and understand them better. Recommended for everyone, regardless of sphere or age!Thank you for the Course!
Excellent. never too old to understand such an important and necessary skill as effective learning. Barb and Terry were great. I'm recommending this course to teenagers all the way to 60 year olds. If only everyone I work with would take this course productivity would go through the roof!
I'm very excited I've finished this course! I want to thank Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski and all the Learn how to Learn Team for the opportunity to know so much helpful information , I've started to use new techniques in my personal life and my job and I can see the amazing results!
I'm so glad I met this course occasionally and click into it so that I didn't miss it.Learning how to learn is an amazing course which really helps me a lot in how to learn efficiently.Thanks a lot and I will keep learning what I like (or not,lol) in the future by using the way it taught.
I loved this course! The instructors were wonderful.  The information was so interesting and presented in an engaging, easy-to-understand manner.  I am already sharing what I have learned with others and believe I am going to be able to apply this information in multiple areas of my life.
It really helps to unwind learning process.Useful techniques explained so easily to use them in daily life with focused and defused mode of thinking.It should be done by students at all age group to learn effectively.It would be really helpful if this course is added in school curriculum.
I found it when I was surfed new ideas to reduce procrastination. It's really work. For example, if I catch the "cue" and stop go to procrastinate, I don't need use willpower all the time. Also, there some facts about how you brain work and many tricks for students about taking the exams.
This course is very well taught and easy to understand. I used to think I will never understand what happens in the brain, but after this course I do understand some basic processen happening in the brain. I recommend this course to people who are studying or just like to learn new stuff.
This Course introduced me to new learning and work techniques that I am sure will help me to be more successful in future learning experiences.  It also reinforced techniques that I have used in the past in non learning settings that can be translated to my educational well-being as well.
It has been a wonder journey learning this course,although I spent almost 1 year to finally finish this.I have learnt tons of insights about learning and some learning techniques.  For instance,memory has two sorts.One is working memory as in short-term memory,the other--long-term memory.
Interestingly without knowing about programme of such nature, i had invented few of these strategies over the years for myself. This is an ideal course for students since it would give them ideas about how to learn better. Personally i feel as an adult it had little less to offer for me.
Thank you, it help me to find a way to impruve my learning, i have 25 years old from Perú. The first time that i saw the couse was in 2016 but my english was basic and i did't have the self confidence to continue that, now finally i been finish it, i feel fabulouse and grateful with you.
I've enjoyed this course more than any other course I've done so far! I've started applying the techniques that I've learned from this course and my learning experiences are already starting to show significant positive changes! A big shout out to the instructors for this amazing course!
One of the best courses I have taken online or anywhere else. It not only added new perspectives but also endorsed some of the methods I already use in learning new things. Will be eternally grateful for the instructors who put in so much effort to give the gift of learning to the world.
I wished I've learned about this sooner! it would've helped me with my schoolwork. I've always struggled to learn and this course really helped me understand what goes on in our minds wile learning and how we can establish systems to help ourselves. Everyone can benefit from this course.
This was a really useful course that will help me with all future learning@!  I wish I had taken it years ago while I was in school, but it's never too late!! The material is also very useful for other aspects in life, especially the learning on planning with a journal.Thanks Dr Oakley!!
It is very nice to learn more about the brain and also I know how to impose my mind more and do not forget the importance of Ianum and non-postponement in addition to the importance of choices and practice. It was a new style that benefited me well and I hope everyone can benefit from it
This is a great course  - Strongly recommended for anyone planning on studying. And if not planning on studying anything this course will motivate you to want to study something. It truly awakens your brain!! Great for everyone from the young student and all through to the retired folk!!
Dear Barbara and Terrence, I want to say Thank You for creating this training and making it free for other people. I got many insights and found many answers for my old questions. Based on your training and my new skills :) I`m trying to learn more effective my daughter. Thank you again!
I wish I had taken this course 20 years back! This is the best course I could have given to myself. I'm indebted to Barbara Oakley for helping me assimilate such invaluable stuff so well in a course of a few weeks. Never enjoyed learning so much. In fact, I have already begun to miss it.
One of the best courses I have ever taken! If you are either a student or a teacher, I highly recommend this course; you will be provided with useful tools to achieve your goals or to be able to guide these who want to succeed in their studies. Barb and Terry, thank you very much indeed.
This course does a good job of explaining the mechanics of how we learn.
  These concepts are useful not only when we are in school, but are 
applicable throughout our lives as the world around us is constantly 
changing and we are constantly  having to adapt.  Well worth anyone's 
time.
Thanking Barbara Oakley for all the efforts she has taken to make this course available. This Course has helped me alot in understanding how our Brain and thoughts works and functions, it also helped me develop a better memory for a better future. Once again i'm grateful to all the team.
This course is very useful and I really liked it. It provided interesting and useful information which backed up with neurological discoveries and gave useful tips and activities for student to learn better. It also listed interesting popular readings and academic journals for reference.
Amazing course and it was instrumental in helping me finish my masters thesis, made me focus more effectively and not panick if I seem to loose focus or not understand what I'm reading. The course gave practical tools in dealing with this and I have been recommending it to other people.
This course was a GREAT way to spend time during this quarantine. I feel very satisfied knowing that I have improved my learning techniques and can't wait to put them into practice with other subjects. It has also helped me improve my self-esteem academically speaking. Thank you so much
Learning how to Learn is presented in an easy to follow and fun way. I wish that I had been introduced to this type of course before now. The concepts are applicable to many areas in life and the learning techniques are relevant for young students right through to Postgraduate students.
Science based, tried-and-tested approaches on the subject I love the most: learning. Accessible language, well defined structure, life changing stuff. A few really minor glitches here and there, nothing that will divert your attention or change anything in a bad way. Highly recommended!
I like learn something new. But i before take this course i just learn with old way. I just learn and learn, but usually it don't last long. So after learning the new way of learning from Learning How To Learn in this course i know i can learn much better. Thanks for the great course !!
Amazing course, I'm a doctor and i know well how to study, but this course did really surprise me, i learned a lot and now i feel that it really changed the way i study and learn or even i live .. i can just say AMAZING !!i advise all people to learn this, this course is a must for all!
Highly recommend this course if you are in a learning rut or procrastinate too much. It may change your way of thinking about learning. Videos are short and straightforward in digestible chunks instead of being a long boring slog.  Includes quizzes in between videos and two assignments.
I am a retired teacher. This course was very interesting. There were various techniques to sharpen our memory. This course teaches to be more disciplined in whatever activities we do. Though we know some of the points told in the course earlier, but it refreshes our mind and reminds us.
Exceptionally Great and Interesting! FABULOUS! I want to watch everything again and again... Congratulations for all creators and staff. Blessings for Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terry Sejnowski and Staff! Thank you very much!!!! You are great!!! This course will change my life completely.
It is my first course and Im absolutely happy that I tried and passed. Its so many new things that I've learned and I really want to continue. Content is perfect - so simple to understand and easy to learn. Much approtation on it! Speacial thanks to Barbara Oakley. She is great teacher.
This course was and amazing reminder that we as humans are capable of a lot things if we take want  to. It will change the your view on things and will prove to you that where is will there is a way. I am very glad. I took this course and I feel much more motivated. Thank you, Coursera.
A very nice course showing the academic research about our brain and applying this knowledge to help us to learn more effectively and with more passion. The course videos and interviews are very helpful and easy to understand. Thanks for your effort of the course's team! So kind of you!
Great Course. So much has been said by many others.  If you're interested in learning great techniques to help master any material not just math and science then I highly recommend this course.  Thank you Barbara and Terry for your commitment to help others to learn and help themselves.
Lectures are fun and interesting as a class on learning should be. I recommend taking this class to anyone who is interested in continuing their education online or on a campus. This course should be a prerequisite to learning from middle school or high school on. An absolute must take!
Exceptional! A calm, easily grasped, and informative course on how the brain reacts to learning. One comes away not only with much understanding on the learning centers of the brain, but how to utilize several mental tools to overcome one's own learning difficulties. Highly recommended!
All the things I wanted to know about learning when I was in school.And some of this stuff, I thought back then I was the only one to think about this stuff, no professor or pupil was talking of these concepts.It would have been hugely useful back then... I will be hugely useful now :)
This is a revolutionary course. I am greatly in debt with the mentor. thank a lot of mentors for presenting such an astonishing feat of educational material with such a thorough explanation of details of the activities of our brain and performance of it in such a beautiful way. Thanks!
I have learned many things in this course. Such as the pomodoro technique, how important sleep is and the difference between focused and diffuse modes in learning. I thought the course was well structured and I would highly recommend it to others. Thank you so much for opening my eyes.
This is a very good course as every thing is explained in very scientific manner. If your going to attend this course then don't leave the optional studies and videos of this course as it will provide you with deeper understanding of the material. A very much thanks to both professors.
Learned a lot of techniques to use our minds. The techniques they've listed and explained in the course, when practised can definitely make you remember anything. And it's not just about learning...they've also explained how to use the knowledge you've gained in the most effective way.
The course is very consice and apt. It is very very useful. The course has actually helped me learn how to learn. It has given me awesome useful techniques to learn new stuff and also cleared misconceptions which I had. Thanks. Also, the professor is a good teacher and is also funny.:)
Thanks so much - I felt like since I am getting older, I would not be able to start out towards a new degree, but you have given me some new tips and techniques that make me feel more confident that I should move forward with taking more classes and hopefully move forward in my career.
This course is really great! Whether you are studying or working I think it gives you so much in terms of mastering how to memorise things. I will be sharing some of these techniques in my new lessons, and I will adapt my lessons according to what I've learned in the course. Thank you!
This course actually corrected some misunderstanding than I held before about learning. It gives a brand new insight about learning and teaches me useful techniques about how to learn. I think anyone who is interested in learning new things should take some time to go over this course.
The course has been very helpful to understand the theory and research behind learning and how our brain works, as well as get some practical tips and tools on how to learn more effectively and master difficult subjects. Thank you Barbara and Terrence for the great learning experience!
Amazing!!! I learned so much and was able to put it into practice immediately. This course blew my mind and I'm recommending it to everyone I talk to.  I'm an informal educator K-6 and I've been using the strategies in this course with my students with great success. Thank you so much!
It's a very interesting course which is helpful not only for improving your learning skills but also your daily habits of thinking and working as well. If you're interested in the subject of the brain and how it's working that course will give you some foundation of understanding that.
Since my own goal is to be a life long learner, I have read a lot of books about learning and brain. This course has demonstrated the framework and method so that I can connect what I learnt together. That is to say, it is like pearls connecting to the necklace. Thanks for your course.
Very helpful and insightful course on how to learn. This course has changed my life, and I'm already seeing inpmrovements in my study life after applying some of the principles and techniques acquired from taking this course. Taking this course has been one of my best decisions lately.
This course was quite valuable for people of all ages.  Really wish that there had been a module or requirement for me to hear this information before starting college, but still, years after graduate school, the concepts and tips presented are of value as we continue to learn in life.
I loved this course. This is the first course that I chose in coursera. I thought that learning how to learn is very important for learning other courses. The knowledge about our learning process was augmented. Thanks to Professors , Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski.Thanks Coursera.
The course provides very useful information in a well explained and organized manner. Plenty of reference material for further reading and study, interviews with expert people, and more. Highly recommended for people that need help and hints on studying and learning habits and skills.
Really insightful course. I recommend it to anyone who is having a hard time in school or even in a work environment where learning is a part of the job. This course is great for people of all ages since it's really easy to understand. Thank you for helping me get over my Einstellung.
This was a very enjoyable course, which was divided up into easily digestible chunks of information.  I was able to implement what I learned right away, and will remember how to take advantage of research-proven ways to deal with procrastination and how to better memorize information.
Really Useful Course. Learnt a lot about our brains, how it works and why it behaves a certain way. Also we learnt lot of tips to improve productivity and becoming better learners. I am thankful to coursera and the amazing people who have put up a lot of efforts in making this course.
Great Course!A brilliant combination of practical toolbox and insights of neurological / behavioral science into the activity of learning. Thus taught by inspirational, brilliant, and funny people, from the main professors to the guests. A great MOOC experience! Well done to the team!
It's a great course for anybody in the academic or the professional world, whether young or old. I do suggest before taking any other courses to enrich your mind and expand your skills, to follow this course first and get the tools as well as the correct mindset to learn your subject.
It's hard to believe that I finished this wonderful class. This class gave me not just new ideas but also help me to recognized what kind of roadblocks that may pop up when we're thinking.Thanks for Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.Terry Sejnowski to teach us this wonderful and useful class.
I would like to thank you. It was a great chance to join this course. It is so beneficial and it helps to learn whatever I want. Really, I was struggling in may engineering major, but now every subject becomes easy with your powerful techniques  in learning how to learn. Regards Saleh
Fantastic course! I'm 39 years old, and I am learning again. I have a master's degree i legal studies and a second master of business administration degree. Now I am sure; I am not old for it. I do my best and I can learn efficiently. Thank you, Barb and Terry, for my new opportunity!
A very vivid and useful aid in understanding, reviewing and improvising the entire process of how we learn. the best part is that it isn't confined to one single branch of specialty, but can be applied to anything and everything including routine tasks making it very apt for everyone.
This course is amazing.I loved the way Ms.Barbara Oakley explained all the topics in an interesting way.I started practicing the techniques and I can see the difference.I am grateful to the instructors and coursera too for bringing the amazing course for the people of all age groups.
Short course with practical tools. I would recommend using the techniques shown in the course be applied during this course itself - such as the Pomodoro technique and mini-testing by recall. It will help you memorize these techniques for future learning. Thanks Barbara and Terrence.
This has been very educational! It has given me a lot of insight on where I fall short and where I was good at when it comes to learning. I've always fashioned myself as a slow learner but now I know that learning is indeed slow. Time and care is necessary to learn - creating chunks.
An essential course for anyone looking to enhance their learning and increase their productivity. I can think of no better course to start with than one that provides the basic building blocks of how to learn - this course should be taken before any other for optimal future studying!
The course is fantastic! My goal was to improve my memory. The course explains the memory processes, the obstacles to memory and memory retention. All this gave me confidence again to know that I am on the right track. I  thank you very much for a great course and a great experience!
This Course was an amazing tool , which help me to understand things , I have and I used to do but by scientific study and from expert and educated people . and encourage me to attend another two courses I wanted to know about and get knowledge in for my beneficial education . thanks
Took Coursera MOOC 'Learning How To Learn'.  Such an amazing delivery that it motivated me to complete my first MOOC.  Practical and well thought through inputs that I can apply in my life.  Simple, engaging rendition that made difficult concepts look really easy.  One word: Respect!
Amazing course. The topics are interesting, the explanations are clear, the interviews are superb stories and valued information from people who master what they're talking about. Instructors are also friendly and tender, I really admire them and I love this course. Thanks for do it.
this amazing course with the very useful advices in every lecture you take in the course. this is very amazing and very interesting topic that is well presented. really thanks for the course and for the recommendation that I still receive on my mail from you thanks for your hard work
Perfect and simple way of explaining all our mistakes that we do due to our brain blocking, timetables or other obstacles that impair our way of learning, I am very glad that accidentally i signed in for the course, and it really changed the way how i see the process of learning now.
This was so fantastic. Ive always wondered about by own study habits and if there were any methods to help remember the things Ive learned and the things I want to learn. This course met those expectations and surpassed them by a long shot. Thank you so much for offering this course!
I am very happy to study the course learn how to learn I am very grateful to those who have set up this course interesting I offer a big thanks from my heart for every team that took the preparation, presentation and follow-up and extend my thanks to the site and management coursera.
It was excellent.  I loved the engaging professors, the visuals, the knowledge.  You've improved my ability to learn since the first video. I've been practicing everything and I'll continue doing it.  I appreciate your efforts in putting this course together.  Thank you very much! :)
I have really enjoyed doing this course!!After graduating from the University I have done nothing with my life, but being a housewife and mother. And now, after 15 years, I think it is time to show the world I am not too old to learn again. Thanks for all the practical learning tips!
In the digital era, we met several people who we do not in real life. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski are the best examples of that concept I think. I am thankful to Coursera and my teachers, looking forward to encounter in new courses and hopefully meet personally in one day!
This is the course which is 'i say' made for me brilliant work both professors and it helps me alot to overcome prcastination (habit of delaying work)  and making learning a habit is so important in your life..At the end  only HABITS are matter  in your life...Thank you from INDIA🙏
Great class! I recommend it for any student looking to optimize their learning. The instructors are very effective and teach some extremely useful techniques for improving learning. I wish I would have learned these techniques before graduating with my bachelors and masters degrees!
I have always think that studying means to sit down for hours and hours, repeating what you want to learn, which I did not do of course,  but now after finishing this course is have learned the right and correct way to do it, and learning become much easier and way more interesting.
This is an excellent course, the information is easy to understand yet you can find all the research to back it up in the sources, the delivery is excellent and the examples and analogies so well done you will get something even if you were already familiar with most of the content.
This course has helped me grasp how to learn and I'm so grateful for it. I'm now looking forward to any and all challenges, projects, learning etc. in any field I choose to get into. I now know for certain that I can be a rocket scientist, if I choose to. Highly, highly recommended.
This course is very beneficial, it is an eye opener on some great points that help accomplish learning goals and exploring oneself, it sheds the light on brain functions in learning and summarizes a list of useful key techniques that I believe will help me in my learning experience.
I loved the ideas, tips, and insights this course offered. Professor Barbara Oakley is wonderful, and I appreciated her demeanor and overall being. The Pomodoro technique has been extremely useful, and I'm looking forward to applying the other methods on more of my Coursera Studies.
Everyone should take this course at least once in their life. The content in this course will be very transformative in my daily life. I'm looking forward to applying the lessons I learned here to all aspects in my life. Will definitely retake this course at least once a year or so.
There are effective ways to learn and one might not be fully aware of such tools generally. Sometimes we might be aware of it but seldom put them to use. Many people like me who wants to learn but wonders why the enthusiasm alone does not make  learning easy should take this course.
I'm just about to start Week 4 of this most interesting course on Learning. Barbara is clear and concise, and every section opens my eyes to even more ways of "learning how to learn". All round, this has exceeded my expectations. Thank you University of California from a UK student.
Thank you so much for spending much time arranging this course. I could understand more learning methods I haven't known before and really hope that I could improve my learning skills by applying what I have learned from this course. Much love from Indonesia. Once again, thank you!
It's been fruitful learning and surely have given me an opportunity to reflect my learning skills. I acquired new knowledge that will contribute to my future learning process. It was a well invest subject. Thank you. Looking forward to more topics to further enhance my development.
This course was wonderful. It teaches valuable skills and techniques with wide applicability that can easily be applied. Additionally, it addresses overcoming learning procrastination. Most importantly it sends the message that you can persevere to reach your learning/career goals.
I have a lot of many things. I can't believe that my full thinking got change by leaning this course. I have got so much improvements in so many time. My only regret is this, I should have this course little earlier in my Life, I am so much happy. Thank you so much for this Course.
It helped me understanding the way our brain works while learning.This courses includes many practical and effective memory techniques that I think can help learners to learn effectively.A big thank you to the both the instructors and coursera to come up with such a helpful course.
Great course: quite small, but very clear and usable format of delivering information, and I love the calm enthusiasm from the instructors. Kind of confirms a lot of what I already noticed, but it's great to know there's science behind it: no excuse not to practice these ideas now!
This is fantastic course for those who want to maybe start learning hard
 topics of those people who are freshman in Undergraduate program (But 
can be useful for every age group). This course doesn't contain any 
pre-requisite knowledge beside knowing English. You should take it .
This course has helped a lot in learning how to learn with different approaches which I have never thought of before, the processes explained in this course has helped me retain a lot of new information and I could complete most of my study and other research work at the same time.
Such an amazing course, I highly recommend this course to everyone. If you want to become sharper, improve your memory or just see where your at and want to learn new things, this course gives you the tools and frame of mind to be able to learn anything competently and efficiently.
I learned so much in this course. Not only did it improve my work and learning since week 1, I'm now finding myself quoting it to friends and teaching them some of the valuable techniques covered. Also, the time commitment is not that big and there is a huge payoff for a long time!
Simples yet effective tools to help you learn better. I've already started implementing some of the things I learned in this course and I hope to have opportunities to put more into practice in the future. I'm sure I'll be able to expand my potential and my ability to learn better.
Fantastic course! I hope I had come across this kind of information early in my life. I feel I could be in a completely different situation right now. Thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for sharing your knowledge on such an important matter and explain it so well!
This course help me to understand how the brain work included powerful of brain. I also got a lot of tips and technique to help me to improve how to learn effectively. Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, and others speaker for sharing the knowledge and experience.
Once of the best MOOCs I have ever done, the consistency, depth, relevance of the content is equal to the mastery of both teachers and the design of the course itself. Thank you so much Mrs. Oakley and Mr. Sejnowsky for your insights and effort in creating such an excelling course.
Excellent course, very useful and very clear steps. Helped me restructure my language learning.Dr. Oakley makes it easy to follow all information and her way encourages to finish the course.Dr. Seknowski is very enthusiastic while giving the info which made me intrigued to continue
I found it enlightening: this course makes you understand how your brain works in very simple words. Actually it was very interesting reading how and why things I already did actually work best in my study routine and learning new things.One of the best ways of spending your time!
This course outlines effective ways to learn and how to escape old habits that may lower your effective ability to learn. If you've ever struggled with studying, procrastination, or find yourself having to reread materials; take this course to open up a new way to study and learn.
I just loved this course. It completely changed me and my way of looking at learning. It made love learning and not seeing the act of learning as a dreadful thing to do. I become an enthusiastic long-life learner. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. from the bottom of my heart
The best course to learn how to learn. You will  get answers many questions that you would have had on learning. The methods and techniques will be extremely helpful. I wish I had known these techniques when I was young where I would have enjoyed learning more than I actually did.
This course is extremely useful for me. As living in a country that exam-oriented education takes the lead, I find that a lot of my former study method were wrong. Therefore, I would definitely recommend this course to my friends, cousins, and of course, my teachers. Thanks a lot.
Best course ever!! I have always been a slow learner. I hope to become a quicker learner by using some of the techniques i learned from this course. I tried to be consistent with my approach to learning. Sometimes before i fall asleep, i tried to recall what I did today. Thank you
very  good insight on how learning is best organized and experiencedvery good structure, guidance and media content on topics presentedhighly valueable further reading recommendations and optional interviewstake your time - it´s worth it anytime... Thank you very much from Germany
Great Course!! I completed this  course (without certificate) today at the age of 23 and wanted the 16 year old me embarking on an undergraduate education to have this material. Alas! All is not lost . Definitely a life changing course for me.Will put its principles into practice.
This course has change my life forever!!! Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for teaching me how to learn!! I highly recommend this course, as it shows strategies that can be applied in any life activity, as so...aren't we daily learners on the school of life! :D
Excellent course, taught by excellent instructions. This is the only class I have taken that is talked about positively in other classes. If your looking for a great class, and learn something that will benefit you down the road of life, then invest some time and take this course.
That´s a wonderful course. It is also an unforgetable experience for everyone who wants to leave the "autopilot" of your own sort of learning and really have a brilliant opportunity of learning from a dynamic and powerful dimension which can really brings good significant results!
This is a great course. As day go by, the more you apply the techniques you've learned in this course, the more you'll see the differences in your learning process. Your mind and body will appreciate. It's a healthy way to get the most of the learning process. I totally recommend!
This course is great.  I enjoyed every minute of the lectures and the interviews too.  It was very motivating and informative.  I learned a lot from it to teach my self and my kids too. Barbara did a great job throughout the course. I recommend this course for everyone at any age.
This course is excellent. I gives many techniques to help improve learning which are applicable to any subject, as well as giving insight into how the learning process in our brains actually work. Dr. Oakley, who is the main presenter, does a wonderful job presenting the material.
It is great course for those who thinks just because of some silly problems. My biggest problem was that i am not consistent toward my studies and i get easily distracted. There are many useful techniques i learned from this course and most that will change my life is "Pomodoro".
It is a refreshing take on learning whether you are a student or a teacher. It is interesting since I work as both and how I can use these techniques, tips and new concepts to improve learning experience and improve my lessons. Thank you Barbara and Terrence for all the material.
The best MOOC out there on the web.  Trust me, you get the benefit of experience from the experts.  Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are the pioneers and they have worked immensely hard to bring this course to us !! Regards and respects and thanks a ton to coursera.com.
I enjoyed learning this wonderful and interesting Subject very much.. :)With Professor Barbara  who was very beautiful through explaining and meeting creative professors in the field of neurology and modern  easy learning .. Thank you. I learned a lot from you.Best RegsrdsAmal J.
I am deeply over whemed by this course and feeling why am i so late in approching such  an enlightening course till today,I congratulate our teachers Barb Okley and Mr sejnowski  for giving us opportunity to learn such course.Also i thank each member to help spreading this course
A very well designed and delivered course that is great for tentative learner as well as a seasoned learner. The interviews with experts are illuminating and inspiring. I learned a few new techniques that I am eager to implement and learned a little bit about how the brain works.
Excellent course! Highly recommend to everyone. I am currently a doctor, with a masters in engineering, and I still learned from this course. This course uses the principles mentioned during the course, like testing during the lecture videos. Best course by far I have ever taken.
Best learning experience ever! I had a lot of Wow moments! never thought learning has the science and the art side together.  I always thought that learning is a simple task and can be done in single way traditional reading! thank you again for the wonderful efforts.-Alaa Alsaadi
It'a great course to take. It gives a lot of new techniques that i can apply in my further studying. As it helps me figure out the inefficent methods i was using i my ealry years study. I hope i could have this course when i was yonger. But it's never too late to get a new start.
This is a very well-presented course that anyone, from teens to seniors, will find helpful. The examples are easy to understand and the concepts are universal. Even as a retired professional, I will be using these techniques in my future studies. Well done and highly recommended.
I think everyone should follow this course. If I'd had these insights when I was in high school, or even the beginning of college, I would have done so much better. But, now, I can apply it to my middle life learning and I'm extremely grateful for that as well. Thank you so much.
Really enjoyed this.I have a much better understanding of motivation & procrastination. They say acknowledging your problem is the 1st step :) I now tools to help combat the ways I procrastinate. Thanks Barb &  Terry- Great course and I recommend it for anyone, not just students.
Very useful course! It's very nicely structured and explained and I really enjoyed going through this course. I will surely try my best to in-cooperate some of the techniques I learned into my daily life. Thanks a lot to the instructors and the whole 'Learning how to learn' team.
Material and presentation was very easy to follow.  Very informative content with concrete tools to help you improve the way you think about tackling any learning situation.  I highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in learning more about their own mind works.
Great course, well laid out and takes its own advise of using small tests to reinforce the content. Dr. Oakley is personable and explains concepts especially well while Dr Sejnowski does into more depth on bio science side of the brain. Overall,one of the best course I've taken.
A very effective course on helping you increase your confidence on learning any subjects that you want to progress in, in your life. The videos are clear, valuable, precise and well structured.A strong recommendation for all those who have difficulties in learning anything new!!
this course was one of the most useful and beneficial courses that I have ever taken. I am a sophomore and the materials and the tips I learnt from this course will help me in my learning process.  A very sincere thanks to Dr Barbra Oakly and Dr Sjensoki for this amazing course.
Provides a very deep understanding of the learning process and well as obstacles we all face. Also helped me build study habits and effective techniques. I found myself facing difficult tasks head on because of the knowledge and awareness I gained through this course. Thank you!
Great course by all means. Breaking down scientifically proven concepts into simple and easy to understand techniques to be used in our day to day learning processes. I am very glad I took this course. It was time well spent. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.
I would recommend this course to anyone. It's incredibly valuable to understand the process by which learning occurs, and how to optimize the learning process, which is something that I believe important institutions such as elementary and secondary schools are failing to teach.
I really enjoyed this course and felt that the instructors did a great job making it interesting, and arming me with the material I needed to Learn how to Learn. I have discussed this course with family, friends and co-workers as a way to increase their ability to learn as well.
Excellent material presentation. The course develops the materials in an exceptionally didactic manner. Information and precious tips are easy to absorb.  It was my first Coursera course and it made me want do more!Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski are excellent instructors!
Beautiful! Insightful! Eye Opener! I wish I had known these things when I was a kid! I would have achieved much more than I have. Anyways since the learning process never stops, I will use these mental tools to achieve my future career goals and also improve the %age utilization
I followed this course just for entertainment, along with with my normal academic courses (Energy and Nuclear Engineering) but it turned out to be very useful for my study efficiency and proficiency. Very good! PS: animations can be a little bit crappy, but they are effective ;)
This is one of the best course regards to learning, "how to learn". This type of courses mush should be included in school/college curriculum to help students for the new way of techniques to master and excel the subject. Thank You for the efforts to make this course available.
It is an excellent course that teaches you  how to learn but also explores  new ways of thinking I recommend you If you want to learn something or even if you just want  to explore because this course is going to change your believes about education , intelligence and learning.
A thank you is a really small word to the acknowledge the change which the course has made in my life. I am thankful to Mrs. Babara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski's teaching and to the whole team of Coursera for providing such a wonderful platform to help students learn how to learn.
This class has some great material, provides scientific support for the prescribed techniques, and has links to some worthwhile reading material. This class was enjoyable, a good investment of time, and I've already recommended it to friends. Thank Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
This course helped me in a great way. I realized why i wasn't able to score more despite being hardworking. These tips and tricks should be taught in schools at a younger age so that many children learn and don't make so many mistakes and regret later. Better late than never !!
Very interesrting. I thought learning is simply, just that, learning. But this course breaks down our brain, our habits and environement we are in and examine how each of theses factors affect our learning. I simply didnt know there is a scientific approach to learn. Thank you.
An amazing course! If you are reading this, please don't miss the opportunity to learn important tools that will develop, not only your capacity to learn new things, but will also in deepen your self knowledge by giving you an interesting insight of your brain and how it works.
This course is pretty useful for teachers as well als learners - and especially for teachers who think they are learners all the time anyways. There is so much background and neurobiology in that it is really worth trying. Even if you already found your own methods of learning.
I enjoyed listening to Barbara and Terry. They presented the topic with an enthusiasm that made me so interested to listen to the next lecture. May be a bit more details or more practical exercises. Otherwise the course was engaging, informative and useful. Thank you very much.
This course gave me great insights in how our brain works and also how to discover and use your potential, I've had problems with procrastination since before and now I've become more productive and more conscious of my learning habits thanks to the lessons. Thank you so much!
The best thing I have ever done to me ever in learning is taking this course.I started this course when I felt that I was falling back in my studies.This saved me.I could not thank enough.Thank you so much for this valuable course.This should be taught in schools and colleges.
I enjoyed this course from beggining to end, the way the teachers explain things, it's just awesome, they make such complicated topics into understandable topics. If you want to know how to learn things better or to improve your learning on any subject, this is for you!! 10/10
Valuable and very useful information that I benefited from with this course, it made me realize many of the capabilities of my brain, how it works, how it thinks and preserves information.
All thanks to the person who created this course and who helped to complete this course.
This course helped me a lot. I got an important knowledge about  procrastination and how to avoid it. This course would be helpful for everyone who interested in self-development and just trying to get fundamentals which will help in building career, own future etc. Thank you.
A wonderful course that I think should be taken annually! Let's remind our selves that how we approach learning is as important as what we are trying to learn. Definitely picked up a few helpful hints, and emotionally won't be as hard on myself for procrastinating and resting!
I would recommend this class to EVERYONE. I loved the spaced out content. I love the neural and cognitive explanations. I loved Barb. I liked the little quizzes and questions we followed up with. I think more activities would be great. I wanted to engage more with the content!
An amazing course, which gives you insight to many concepts and knowledge. It should be taught at the beginning of school to make students life easier. At the last week they provide you with excellent tips for test taking methods and anxiety.Thanks a lot for this great course.
what a great course covering the most basic skill of all: Learning!Barbara and Terrence created a wonderful, modern MOOC to engage the audience and have them improve their learning skills.  A good investment of my time of which I feel certain I will reap the benefits.  Thanks!
I will never see sleep as a waste of time thanks to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. We have to rest to allow our brains to make connections and improving our performance, even if it sounds as a cliché I have to say to myself: I only regret not finding this course before. Thanks.
Wonderful engagement and enthusiasm for the material.  I enjoyed seeing educators delve into the process of learning rather than the mechanical bubble test format that is passed off as learning in our society today.  Thanks for the great effort you put into this lovely course.
Great class! Learning something new everyday, specially learning how to learn is a very useful tool to navigate through life, wether you are a young person going thru school, college or grad school, or even if you are middle aged or older and want to brush up on your skills...
The best course I've studied. (not only in Coursera) Your Learning skill, and more importantly, Understanding of How learning works can Improve magically through it. You can learn better other things with it. Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.Terry Sejnowski. Happy Learning!
This course is amazing! The lectures is short and easy to understand but at the same time contains a lot of useful tips and tricks. I am very glad to master that lessons and for sure will recommend it to all my friends. I thank to all of the creators for their invaluable work.
An outstanding introduction on how to undertake deep, life-long learning that will delight and challenge you while helping you achieve your goals and dreams.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful and entertaining course with the world.  I only wish I had taken it 20 years ago!
A very helpful course to anyone interested in growing intellectually, crafted with the finest current knowledge into the human mind and the learning process.  I enjoyed this course a great deal and I recommend it to anyone thinking about enlarging his/her knowledge boundaries.
With help of this course I did a workshop in Tamil language  in a TamilNadu  school, India. It was huge success and students nicely picked up the points. Thanks a lot to professor. Great course..needed for all students..not only students..to everyone. Kirthika,Bangalore,India.
It was an awesome experience going through the videos and thinking about the material later. I would find myself eager to watch the furthur videos. THe instructors were clear, and explained well. The video quality, editing were top notch. Overall, definitely a great experience
The lectures and the testing were valuable ways to learn the material. I used some memory and visualization techniques and was able to  remember much of the material. It was not difficult but gave me a lot of confidence to tackle something harder. I may try a math class soon.
This is course has helped me immensely. I now use the pomodoro, space repetition, recall, frequent testing and many other techniques effectively. I am able to study better.  I feel better equipped to achieve in my study areas! Barbara Oakley is Wonder Woman for me henceforth!
Thanks for your course,I really learn a lot and open my mind lead me into a new world,let me know why I feel so frustrated when i learn the new things,that's normal and with my perservince,i can master it and do it well.Thanks for giving me the courage and the learning skill.
It was very efficient to alarm me of the wrong paths I've been taking at the hour of studying or taking a test, It gave me some techniques to avoid, prevent and "fight" procrastination, and It was useful at the hour of knowing "what was behind" all of the process of learning.
This is the best course i have taken in coursera for so long. I am very happy with this course and i will recommend this to every student weather bright or dull, to take this course. I am fully satisfied with the time and energy i had given to this course. Its fully worth it.
I enjoyed the course. Well researched, rich content, easy to understand by a person without an in-depth knowledge of the subject. I will definitely use the acquired knowledge into my upcoming learning opportunities and also share them with my child to assist with her studies.
it is the first course that I completed in coursera. the skills i accquired build a solid fountation for other courses. since then, I do not feel frustrated any more during learning, because I have developed my own methodology and procedure to learn.believe me, just learn it.
Very insightful course. I corroborate many of the methods presented here like mini-testing, recall and illusions of competence with my own experience before taking the course which I used to apply subconsciously, per se. Highly recommend this course to all learners out there.
Truly helpful tips and very interesting facts about brain and learning expounded in easy to understand, clear and sometimes funny way by the professionals. I highly recommend this course. The methods of learning presented there can be applied to every skill you want to learn.
Very beautiful experience of learning how to learn. Thank you Dr. Terrence Sjenowski and Dr. Barbara Oakley for making our journey through this course very exciting and wonderful. This has helped me gain self-confidence and also to overcome my fears of learning something new!
Really amazing,i think everyone should start this course before study any courses,not only hereon Coursera. it should be first step before learning, and then which will make you study effectively.I won't never regret in choosing this Learning how to learn course, many thanks.
The single most useful course on Coursera that everyone should take, because what it teaches can be applied to many aspects in life, not just related to school-type learning. Bite-size videos make participants easier to finish, and the course book is a very useful supplement.
This is a very nicely compiled course, explaining in detail how the mind works. Personally I liked the  focused and diffused thinking and how it helps in improving the creativity. I am of the opinion that this course should be taken by high school grade students and teachers.
I loved the course! It changed my thoughts about the mind and learning. Now I know that I can learn anything. And the most important: I know HOW to learn it: from general understanding of brain work to technics and real mental tools. Thank you very much, Barbara and Terrence!
I thought the Learning How to Learn course was exceptional and well put together giving me the behind the scenes of learning how one learns. This was the missing component that will equip me to take on more challenging subjects strategically in my pursuit to obtain knowledge.
This course was very helpful, the videos and the material are well organized and the book is a good thing to have... as you will learn, mixing different sources of motivation to learn a subject actually help you in the learning curve. Be sure not to miss this awesome course !
Amazing course!  If you're having trouble learning and focusing, check this course out.  The structure is very well layed-out, and information is presented in a straightforward presentation as a series of videos.  Watch the optional interviews, too, for some very good advice.
A really interesting and thought-provoking course that combined theoretical neuroscience and practical ideas for maximising study skills in real-world settings. I shall be recommending to all my students that they ought to sign up for future edition of 'Learning How to Learn.
I am really grateful that I came across this course. I have learned lots of things that will surely help me in my many more years of learning. I am very excited to apply the skills and techniques I've learned in my everyday life. Thank you very much for creating this course!
This is an amazing course. It takes you in a splendor journey to explore your invaluable gift; Your Brain. It gives you an insight about the learning abilities you have been gifted with. Thank you very much for designing such a helpful course. Enjoyed a lot learning from it.
I learned new technics about how to improve my learning skills and even I have realized why I failed to pass some tests in the past. Apart from that, the course was conducted in a very enjoyable way.Thank you very much for helping me to gain more skills in this field.Regards
It a an amazing course. Every one should undergo this course which gives new insights to learning methods. I feel fortunate to have come across this course and complete it.  I feel very  grateful to the speakers for introducing such powerful mental tools to learning methods.
Its a wonderful course, helped me a lot in my learning. Here I have learnt , how to learn. The techniques and the practices which I learnt were helpful and makes me more confident to take the responsibility of my learning. Thank you Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski.
it's an amazing experience to understand how the human mind works, and with simple learning tricks and techniques , one can easily learn whatever he/she wants. Additionally, it's not only working with your area of interest/subject but also beautiful works with hard subjects.
This is my fist online course ever and it's the best course to start with. Really it changed my mind on learning and following the career for academic degrees first and secondly to learn about each and everything else in a very practical useful way.thank you.you inspired me.
This course has been so helpful! I am actively employing techniques I learned in this course to learn Linear Algebra. I honestly feel like I have never been a more effective or efficient learner. Highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to learn new subjects in the future.
Throughout public school there is no place where I have been taught theory behind learning, it was just study this or finish an assignment. Most of the concepts are generally basic but if you have never heard or thought about it, it is worth investing time into the material.
This course helped me realize that I'm not just naturally better at learning certain topics than others, but that the process and approach I take matters most. I am so excited to apply what I've learned here to other areas in both my own learning and my children's education.
During this course I had the chance to learn new metodologies about learning. I started to practise them soon and I am still doing it  successfully and satisfactorly. I will be always grateful to Professors  Terry Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley and all Courera staff. Francesco
This course contains nothing and everything. It is very beneficial and helpful. I remember before this course how much it was hard to self learn or to learn generally. Now, I learn what i need to learn with apx. 1/3 the time i used to take. Thank you so much for such course.
Hello, This is the greatedt course everyone must follow before starting any study. Thanks for all. It helps me understanding some of my behaviors. I just regret to not have been aware of it to deliberatepractice it. I will now abuse of it to masterlot of topics. God bles you
This amazing course really changed the way I'm studying. My last week was especially productive as now I understand more about how our brain works and how to make learning enjoyable. I feel so motivated and want to learn more! That's precious. Thank you Barbara and Terrence!
I would like to thank to instructors and all those who are involved of making such a helpfull and good quality course.I loved the process and the product with all my heart.It was a amazing experience participating and being a part of the project.Thank you all.My Best.Ferhat.
This course is pretty great in helping you realize the functions of your brain so that you can learn more effectively.  I wish I had taken this course when I started college... because I most certainly would have gotten more out of my degree with the knowledge ahead of time.
This is a great course and I highly recommend it to anyone who is getting ready to begin a new learning path. Whether it be college, a new job, or a Coursera module, this course will help you in understanding a little bit about why your brain does what it does. Great course!
Great course, with many interesting tips and tricks to improve your learning. Each segment is a short, compressed input of well presented, helpful informations.Practical rules and methods are given, which can be applied easily into your way of learning.Thanks for the effort!
this course is awesome. the analogies the tutor used made us understand the topics easily. it made me venture into the topic of neuroscience and I would love to learn more. Dr. Oakley gave us good content and material. Thank you Dr.Oakley for helping us through this course.
This is a wonderful course.   I recommend this to anyone of any age.   I look at learning as a life long adventure and wish I could have had taken this course 35 years ago!  Thank you to Barbara, Terrence for their expertise and Coursera for offering this incredible course!
It ia very nice course , and i recommend this course for those who have just started learning on Coursera . Also very useful and grateful for your life . Doesn't matter what your age is or what is your occupation , it's about learning how to learn. Thank you Barbara Oakley.
I truly have learned more about learning techniques and I brought Dr  Barbara Oakley book  called A Mind for Numbers. I can't wait to start read it. I enjoyed learning on Coursera this was my first time taking a class on Coursera but I will be taking more classes in future.
The course is amazing. I am an undergraduate student who is struggling with writing essays, grappling 3 minors Politics, Philosophy and Economics, and I genuinely feel like I can have hope again. The course excites me to learn as well. Life is much better and it was before!
A really great, practical and useful course! It really baffles me that in all my School years no one ever covered with students how to LEARN and not how to REPEAT. I'm in my 30's and curse like this only motivate you for further exploration and learning! Really recommended!
Learning How to Learn offered a brand new perspective: along my years of learning, I had been fixating on the subject itself and using less efficient ways. With the tips and techniques provided in this course, I am very confident to start my learning journey with much ease.
I joined the course to acquire learning tools and techniques for me and for my children. As someone who believe that knowledge and learning are values for life, I think that this course is essential for anyone who wants to learn or to teach effectively. Mandatory and great!
Very good course in the way it is taught and very essential before you attempt to study and learn anymore on Coursera or elsewhere. I wish I had such a course in my school days! I am going to recommend this course to all people I meet - especially students and young people!
Fantastic. Difficult topics are nicely simplified and it has ton of really great ways to improve your learning style. I was also very surprised by some of the ideas, but I have since found that the techniques that I was most surprised about, are the ones that work the best.
This course opened my perspectives so much! I realized the habits that I have developed over the years were inefficient! Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski helped me understand how I actually learn. They actually do what they teach and the interviews prove what they are teaching.
That course really helped/is helping me in my daily life and in my academical/professional life. I'm sure I've got to apply these notions of memory to become a better student, and as a teacher I want to show my students how to improve their results by Learning How to Learn.
This course gives greater insight into what we use everyday. The information was useful in helping to identify the current habits being practiced. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve and maximize the natural resource that we have, that is our brain.
There were so many things I did not know about learning and sleeping and now I know that in order to be an effective learner I have to sleep to remove the metabolic toxin in my brain, not try and learn with a tired brain. Thank you for this course, I am very glad I did it.
Brilliant course! Very well structured and easy to follow. The mini quizzes are also very helpful in retaining the material. Barb is practical teacher giving us tips on how to apply research in daily tasks while Terrence gives us insights on behind the scenes neuroscience.
Im a better learner now, with an important update about how to learn. 
With this course I have acquired multiple new tools and methods that 
helps me to improve my learning. Thank you Coursera for made this course possible, Thank you Barbara & Terrence! Happy
 learning! :)
Excellent course! Every body should take it. I wish I had read this when I was in college. I seem to have been using only my focus mode all along. I am looking forward to using the the tools that I learnt from this course! Thanks Dr Barbara Oakley and the other professors!
The techniques and explanations learned in this course are helping my learning to have a better flow. The
 Pomodoro and the recall technique already helped me to overcome the 
procrastination barrier of a subject that I had to study and it actually 
worked! I recommend it!
This course is fantastic, I am at the beginning of this journey and the way I think and learn has changed and is changing a lot because of this course, I am sure that the content of this course will take the one that applies all content to success in various areas of life.
This Course is just what I needed for helping mw with my procrastination. The tools and ideas given are amazing, and Barbara is incredible in her deliverance. Very happy i am taking this course. Looking forward to my final year of my degree to put everything into practice.
i recommend this course to everyone who is serious at studies. only "effort" is not enough for success, you should know how to better utilize the effort and this is exactly what this course addresses. i am glad i was among thousands others who learned "learn how to learn".
Really good course to teach us how to learn effectively, especially how to overcome illusion of competence and procrastination, which are help me a lot. Will apply the theory to my daily learning processes. Hopefully I can learn more effectively and happily from now on :)
Great course for those who search for people who want to learn more about how our brains work and what techniques can we use to increase productivity during learning. Enjoyed the course, additional interviews with interesting people is another good thing about the course.
I learned a lot about our brain structure and learning process. And I received specific techniques for effective training, which I will try to use in the future and tell about them to my students.
Many thanks to the teachers of the course, Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski!
This is definitely one of the best online courses I've ever completed. I really loved the way it was taught. The course material was backed with Scientific research papers and a lot of insights about human brain. It was a really great experience learning "How to learn" :)
This a worthwhile course that can be applied by everybody, I'm using it to set me up for further study and feel much more capable of doing so with it. The course structure has a way of getting the information to stick with you as well, which is what it's all about really.
This course may help eliminate the dogmas or wrong belief in your mind about learning, which would help build your confidence again. It also provides very useful tips and techniques to help you learn more easily and better. This is a course that might influence your life.
This is a great course -- short but with well-presented material.Although I was familiar with most of the mental models and techniques presented, it was extremely useful for me to see which study techniques in particular have been shown to be the most effective.Thank you!
I found this course very useful, well structured and with plenty of surprising information about how the brain works. I will certainly apply some particularly techniques to better understand, learn and retain new subjects and arguments. Learning is a never ending process.
After this cousre, I was motivated, confident, Plan learning effectively easily, Avoid procastination, Manage work tasks well, Deal with difficult work/subjects with process approach, Speedup learning, Teach my child ways to learn and Understand brain facts. Thank you :-)
I was very pleased to take the courses "learning how to learn", hoping that it will be useful for me the rest of my life to learn to tackle subjects that seemed to me quite complex. I thank Dr. Oklay and all those who contributed To render these courses acceccible to all.
Many thanks for this course. Some ideas was really new to me and I learn a lot. More important, this isn't another "tips and tricks" course, It is the system which smart people can use to improve themselves.Keep up the good work. It was a pleasure getting to know you.. :)
Excellent course. Completely changed my perspective and approach to learning. The learning materials are very clear and cover topics from learning methods, tackling procrastination and psychological biases that limit your ability to learn new things. 100% would recommend.
It was great to LEARN How To Learn. . . Though I'm still looking gonna come back frequently to watch all the optional interviews & assignments.Though it took me about 6 months to complete this, but I had fun & learned a lot. I'm gonna apply all of this into my daily life.
I really enjoyed the opportunity to better understand how best to learn. Though I've always said that I am a "life-long learner", I don't think I ever fully knew how to be a life-long learner until now.I'm excited to employ these strategies into my day-to-day experiences.
Absolutely amazing course. I recommend it to every person that finds learning difficult ! Why they didn't teach me that in school ... ? Now I am really learning  - first time in my life ( and I'm 29 years old). I love you Barb and Terry for doing it for us and THANK YOU X
This course is a must for anyone regardless of their work disciplines.It has been crafted well to suit audience of all ages.This course help us understand the common pitfalls in the way we try to learn and provides simple and effective guidelines to maximize our learning.
This course helped me to realize some of my bad habits of studying. Even thought I started it very recently, I can already see some improvements in my learning. I recommend it for everyone who is interested in some tips on how to be more effective when studying a subject.
Thank You for making this wonderful course. It is really helpful to learn about learning. It will be beneficial to everyone for the future in the process of learning. The instructors are very interactive and well educated. The interview are also important in this course.
love this course thanku sooo much coursera for this amazing journey ok learning how to learn. Thanks alot to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for the amazing study guide for learning in the best way as i have applied all in daily life and have seen a miraculous change.
Ive really enjoyed learning how to learn.  The technics applied will be of great impact to myself and others who will cross my path. I hope more people will be interested in this wonderful course. A big thank you to the facilitators who took their time for us. Thank you!
The course is great. I found the second module (on chunks) especially useful. I've read several books on the topic of study techniques and they have helped me a lot. This course includes all of the main ideas I've learned from those books and more. I highly recommend it.
One of the most valuable course i took in my life. It carries a lot of techniques that will help every learner move on and reach the highest potential in learning process. The instructors and the interviewers are very informative and quite easy to understand the content.
Highly informative course for people of all age group. The course instructors have really done a great job to make this course interesting. The videos containing interviews with other professionals in various fields were very useful. I really loved learning how to learn.
Excellent course! Gave me new insights about learning effectively and efficiently. I  applied some of the concepts to learn new subjects and it worked out very well. Kudos to the course designers. It will not be an exaggeration to say that this is a life altering course!
This is a great course.  The facilitators are great.  The course demonstrates how powerful online learning can be.  I also enjoyed reading the assignments written by my fellow students on the course.  Thanks to Barbara and Terrence for all their work creating the course.
As a highly educated professional, this course is mind blowing (no pun intended)!  Informative, fun and powerful.   I'm excited to share information with others and enhance my life.  Also, incredible insight gained as a parent to help my kids with their learning as well!
I really enjoyed this course. It starts off with basic topics we are all familiar with and then goes into how the mind works and how we can make the most out of learning. I really liked the course because it actually gave methods in how to learn (like the memory palace).
I found the course really informative as it outlines a scientific explanation of how the brain works and how better we could deal with it in order to achieve our goals. I feel these kind of courses should be included as mandatory life skills in from a school level itself
Very engaging and extremely well thought out course that reflexively employs the techniques and concepts it teaches. Be prepared to learn by teaching by creating a video summarizing what you learn on module 3 about Procrastination and Memory. I was not prepared for this.
It is a well compiled course and it really helped me to understand why we behave in certain ways in certain situations. Pomodoro technique is probably the best thing I have learnt in this course. I am able to manage my time and work more effectively. Thank you very much!
This is a great course to think about how you learn and find ways to both learn more efficiently and also to find more enjoyment in learning. After this course, you should have an expanded toolbox of study techniques and also a framework to approach new and old subjects.
I learn much from this course. Not only theories and strategies, but also belief. Everyday I am struggling with my laziness and fear about learning. And now I am trying to apply the ideas into my life. This is an interesting and useful course. Thanks to the two teachers!
The course was really very helpful in learning so many new things about learning. It was also very interesting, at the same time easy to understand. Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terence sejnowski have done an excellent job. Thanks for teaching about learning how to learn!!
This course really helped me get a hang of how to manage procrastination, focusing on work and being able to the most productive I've ever been in my entire life!I'd definitely recommend anyone who is having trouble studying or learning to go through this course :)Peace.
I strongly recommend this course for learning more about how your mind works and how to be a better learner. It is extremely helpful and I strongly recommend it. It can change your perspective on so much and boast your confidence with subjects you feel less confident in.
Thank you for this amazing course, You've taught me new learning techniques and reminded the old ones, that I knew, but didn't use. I loved how you explained the information, visualized it, used different examples and made me think about my learning habits. Thanks again.
This is one of the best course I have ever taken. I am confident that the knowledge I have acquired from this  course will result in massive impacts in all areas of my life. Both the instructors were so energetic and passionate throughout the course. Highly recommended!
The course really helped me a lot to make myself better in things that I'm not before the course,and the new study ideas, techniques for improvising memory, avoiding procrastination.....a lot more.I strongly recommend to try the course,it's really worthful of your time.
I felt like the team were my friends and invested in my learning.  The downloadable stuff and layout of material as well as the manner it’s presented made learning and being motivated to learn so natural and easy! Thank you so very very much for a brilliant course! Xoxo
Prefect and insightful. I got few tools that I have started applying right away and it is helping me every day. I was wondering if I had this tutorial in my school days, I would have done any thing I would have dreamed off. Thank you for educating me about how to learn.
Unlike other 'self improvement' courses, the scientific basis of the techniques in this course has made it easy for me to immediately start practicing on them and the results are already evident. In my doctoral studies, this course has been a great help. Excellent work!
I learnt a lot from this course. how brain works in learning and I reflect myself learning habit. It provides the reason why we need to so , not do others. It's very practical course. and I plan to change myself in learning and also share the founding to others. thanks!
this course is pretty good, you will learn many tricks and techniques that make your studying skill more professional, I really wish if I had taken this before I graduate from the university, but at least I can use the material for learning anything else during my life.
I think the course was very good, I have learned a lot. I already started using a lot of techniques from the course in my studies, and have already been noticing results, which is amazing. I think the course could further benefit if more "advanced" material is included.
what i have learned from this course is beyond imagination.I recommand this course to more people who want to learn happily and effectively.After all learning is a life-time thing which means we all have to get along with it with all our heart and soul.Thank you Barbely
Whether student or teacher, this course is a must.  full of easy to learn, valuable insights that will save you time and energy throughout your life.  I would have loved to have known this earlier as its applications are useful for both the full time and casual learner.
Implementing even a few of the methods taught in this class helped me improve my learning and move forward. Knowing how to learn best is a key skill in today's world and Professor Oakland teaches this skill in a very clear and engaging way. I really enjoyed this course.
An outstanding practical course with just enough science for those of us who care about "how things work" about how our brain retains information and knowledge. After attending several graduate programs, I wish I had attended this course during my undergraduate studies.
A must learn course! So many insights! A charming lector! There is a proverb (from bible if i recall correctly) if you give man a fish - he will have food for one day, if you teach him fishing - he will have food for his entire life. This course teaches you how to fish.
This course is super simple and easy to digest. Its clear the tutors are super passionate about the subject matter and have gone to lengths to ensure its relevant, fun and memorable. Its straight forward and has quite a few effective pearls for helping one learn better.
I really like the way this course was done. It was full of explanations, metaphor, and allegory, such as learning methods they have presented. The MCQ at the end were great, and all the MOOC was done according to the learning concepts they wanted to present.Thank you :D
This course enabled me to be self-disciplined, and with the new techniques that I acquired from this course is incredible. I had fun along the way, and I'm sure to have good grades on my test. I am also confident to be exploring new studies and skills after the course.
This course was awesome. Teaching people learning how to learn seems a very basic thing in education, but there are not many people that take it seriously. Because of this I found the content of this course very helpful and thank instructors for the great job they did.
In 21st century, the one most important skill all people need to learn and practice in "Learning to Learn". This course is very effective in helping people acquire this skill and those who start practicing the same will take control of their learning and life, in turn.
Great course, it goes through the simple to the complex stuff about how your brain works when you are learning. It also teaches how to tackle procrastination and get rid of the anxiety during a test.Not to say about the awesome teachers that we got. Learn How To Learn!
Fantastic course. Excellent outline of learning techniques, with very friendly instructors, and quite an accessible approach to deep, complex matters related to human psychology and neurology. I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their field of study.
Without exaggeration this is one of the most powerful tool to change your life. I guess it should be mandatory course for all students no matter the field. I can help you to achieve everything you want in professional and personal life. Thank you very much for sharing.
The best class (online/offline) I've taken. So simple to understand and applicable to almost any subject or skill: music, language, science, etc.. This information should be taught in public schools. I recommend this class to everyone, or any age, background, or field.
I love it, It consolidated everything that I know about studying. I knew a lot of this by experiencebut never once have I thought some of them as related to my everyday learning. A lot of commontraps that we fall to every day is tackled. I suggest you take it as well.
Very helpful, the course is well prepared and is not boring.I'm already applying some of the ideas passed on the course, and the more I use them the more natural it becomes.Really enjoyed it! Great work!Thank You very much for the effort in making this amazing course!
I recommend this course to everyone , In this course you will not only learn how to do better in exam but you will also learn how to do better in real life and you will get some insight how our mind and body works. It is one of best course i have taken in my lifetime.
It is an amazing course. I would highly recommend it to those who are
struggling with learning whether it is a science or other area. Not only this
course helps to learn, but it also provides you with many helpful insights
which could be applied to any sphere of life.
Excellent course. It has really helped me in learning new things and also shedding that misconception that why should we keep things in mind when we have mobile, computers etc with us. This course in fact has encouraged me to learn many other new things. Thanks a lot.
This course is fantastic.  The  quality of the course lectures, resources, tips, strategies, and assessments were impressive.  I enjoyed the time spent taking this course.  Spending time with Dr. Oakley  and Dr. Sejnowski was the dopamine I needed to fight my zombies.
It was a really good course that goes above and beyond what learning how to learn had to be. The course goes into the neuroscience in an understandable way that help u grasp the ideas of learning. Also it gives u tips on a whole bunch of different aspects of learning.
This turned out to be surprisingly easy to follow, and has been the best online course I've participated in so far. It has been immensely useful for my current learning strategies and understanding more about myself and how I learn. The course lecturers are excellent!
It is a very useful course that helped me find mistakes in my approach to learning. I will apply knowledge from the course to improve learning of my profession. And I think that now I can better teach students on my own courses. :) Thank you very much for this course!
It's been my first experience on taking a theoretical online course and it inspired me to take more! I find the information learned very useful! Besides I love the way it is given - it's fun to learn! And the knowledge I've gained will definitely stay with me forever!
This course was a wonderful experience for me as I am applying for undergraduate study. The techniques for tackling procrastination have been really helpful and it helped me identify flaws in my own study methods. I would highly recommend everyone to take this course.
Learning How to Learn has been an eye opener to many different aspects of learning. Hope to make the best use of the techniques taught in the course throughout life by practicing them diligently. Many thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrance Sejnowski and the team!!
Great Course! And Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Mr. Terrence Sejnowski, Coursera and many others who make this course available to public! It is really changing life course! Hope for new part for it as life is evolving and new concepts will be out there always :)!
I really enjoyed this course and will use the information I've learnt with my daughter as well as some of my students. The professors were engaging and taught the concepts in a way that one could understand. I look forward to trying out my new skills in other courses.
Amazing course with lot of useful tips and deep and easy to understand explanation on how the brain works and how to improve your capacity of learn. Moreover, the course contains lot of optional materials related to the lessons that reccomend to watch. My compliments!
Thank you ! I been out of school for years now and always wanted to teach myself now things and better retain information I read. I also have to take my G.E.D in some months and now I AM 100% confident I will pass thanks to this amazing course :) I will miss you guys
Definitely interesting course which helps demystify the way we think. The course provides useful techniques to learn and remember. Barb and Terry have genuine intentions for helping people learn better and it shows in their effort with the course materials and tests.
first i was very excited to learn this course and was expected to learn very different approach to learn and after completing this course I am glad to tell you all that i have come with lots of techniques which actually helps to improve learning. and lastly thank you
My study-time has decreased by a significant margin and I manage to memorize a lot more things I've studied, just by using the techniques described (and thoroughly explained) in this course. Highly recommend it for everybody, regardless of age, educational level etc.
Exceptional course, has helped me a lot to understand more about my learning techniques and mistakes I have made all along my academic life.  Barbara Oakley is truly a remarkable instructor, makes learning feel like such an easy and natural process, highly recommend.
Well, I'm sure that it's an amazing course. Nevertheless I'd already known ~20-30% of material from other sources. It gives wide perspective on how to learn.Certainly, it's worth spending each second from all the required time to go through it.
I highly recommend it.
Absolutely Brilliant! Funny, interesting, lots of useful tips and good explanations of everything, has really helped me to study much more effectively and efficiently.  And the Professors are kind and friendly in the videos, along with very good at explaining things.
Definitely worth taking this course. The most important takeaway for me is to realise the mistakes that I had committed previously while studying. It is nicely delivered in an acceptably short format where the message is clear and we can get down to work immediately.
I love what I learned. I think everyone should take this course regardless of where they are at in their journey of knowledge. If you are just beginning this will aid you so much! If you are already deep into your academic career this will help enhance your learning.
I enjoyed the course, even when on a few points that i thought were getting tough the techniques taught helped me. I dont actually have any tests per se to do, but I hoped/hope that this course will help me with other courses on Coursera as well as generally in life.
This was by far one of the best decisions I made in my life to take this course. Dr.Barbara and Dr.Terrence really put together a prime course with lots of useful information, I highly recommend!!Thank you Dr. Barbara and Dr.Terrence, thank you Coursera.Jeff Pereira.
Very interesting, I have learned a lot and I feel more confident in my ability to learn anything. I recommend it for anyone feeling stuck in their learning or anyone who wants to take charge of their learning instead of stumbling through and learning "as it happens"
This is the first course everyone should take after signing on Coursera. No only did I learn new "skills to learn skills", but I got some fundamentals on how the mind and the brain works, and how to take advantage of that to "hack the brain" and build better habits.
A work of love with all the due diligence and research from a top learning institution. Very grateful and now hopeful on a new journey of learning, not studying (here used to define the poor methods of learning resulting from a school system based on factory labor).
I am very grateful to the teachers for such an informative, useful and inspiring course and a pleasant time spent. The valuable information that I received, I will use myself and pass on to my children. Dear Barbara Oakley and Terrens Sejnowski, тhank you very much!
one of the best courses I've ever taken on Coursera, I have learned a new technique of learning methods like Podomoro, chunking, focus, or diffuse method.  if I have known this course early especially on my college day. I could be graduated as a "cum Laude' student.
Excellent course. Useful and applicable techniques which are particularly helpful for students. The course has a well designed structure. The course coordinator, Dr. Oakley, is clear in her explanations. I would probably revisit this course again in the near future.
At first I used to have a lot frustration but after getting these ideas, it really gives me confidence. It was really great. I have learned so many new concepts. The professor was really great. Anyone regardless of any discipline must be benefited from these ideas!!
this course is thought changing. I think it is the basic education that should be available to every student out there. We should learn how we learn so that we can do what we are doing effectively. I highly prescribe you this course for natural health of your brain.
Absolutely loved this course! I took it in junior high. I am a student with many passions and interests that this course has helped me further my learning in. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to make their learning easier, stronger, faster, and more enjoyable.
This was fabulous and really helped me. I plan on using these study skills and am so glad I learned them. Highly recommend this course whether you are trying to learn how to study or professional, it will help you learn even more. 5 out of 5 stars. Excellent course!
This is a great course for anyone who wants to get foundation tips as to how to achieve maximum results from their learning experiences. It is also for those who want to improve their academic abilities and those who simply want to be more organized in their career.
This course is very good because it focuses on practical aspects of learning. I picked up new ideas to improve my learning style every week . The unusual and often funny way information is presented makes it easy to follow the lessons and to remember the main ideas.
Excellent course. Very informative and fun. I like the pragmatic approach, with emphasis on practical tips that will help you grasp the material more easily, but the course is also giving the background story on why and how those tips work.Would recommend to anyone.
This course was a delight to take. I am already using techniques from this course in my life. I am currently learning flying trapeze. Every trick involves multiple parts and I have been focusing on "chunking" small portions of each trick that I learn. Works wonders.
Very helpful course for anyone who has a ton of goals and wants to accomplish them. This will certainly aid in academic success as well as finding excellent tips for how to stop procrastination and solve difficult problems. Strongly recommend to anyone and everyone.
A must do course for everyone who wishes to learn any subject from arts to science to engineering etc. This would help you to know how our brain functions while learning something and will provide the best and effective methods to learn and understand something new.
It's kind of enlightening course, many of the things you might feel that you know and actually you knows. But it will teach you the practical aspects and reason why to follow certain learning methodology. If followed it can help in making you more efficient learner.
just one comment. I wish I had this tool when I was studying at university. I has tremendous tools and advise to make your study more effective and meaningful. Great job in preparing his course, I am sure many are already enjoying the results of applying such tools.
Thank You for a great great experience! I think I will be better as soon as I practice more and more. Than You for your words when you advice regarding of feelings of inadequacy. I appreciate that. Thank You Dr. Barbara Okley and Dr. Zejnowsky. Best Regards. Mariela
Wow, All this while I was thinking that I know really well how to learn things, and after completing this course I realised some of my methods were rather detrimental to my learning . Used this course's teaching in learning other 3 courses and I could learn better .
I am very very excited to keep in touch with this online course, also it makes me to get better much info about what should and shouldn't I do while learning something (not for academic only) and I could practice it soon when I get my semester in August. Thank you!
Thank you so much for helping me to understand that I can have more opportunities to study in a better and effective way, that I can ask for more to my brain and to myself, that I can waste less oppurtunities by larning more.I'll definitely sit the following course
This course is very usefull - I need to internalize so many information, but now I know how to do it in easier and more effective ways :)  New knowlegde and practice of it in one time. What's more it is funny, and positive emotions and jokes make it more memorable.
I only regret it for not doing it sooner. The tips I have learned, I am implementing to my daily routine... It's really an important life hack to learn how to learn. It will continue to help me in more areas of my life. Thank you very much for creating this course!
I truly enjoy taking this course and will definitely take the continuation course of this. A lot of helpful tips that I wish I had learned when I was still in high school. Regardless, the tips and techniques gained from this course can be used at all stage of life.
Very useful. It helps you to see the things that really serve the learning process. It goes straight to the point. I definitely recommend it for students who want to improve their study skills and for teachers who want to help their students improve in their study.
I learned a lot about how to learn. I know this information can and will help me as I continue taking classes and learning more and reaching my educational goals. I also hope to bring some of what I learned about effective learning to my future career as a teacher.
I loved Barbara's teaching  style.  She made things easy to remember with the visuals, the reviews, and the quizzes.  I have started using these techniques in my Spanish class, and it has helped so much.  I'm also going to teach these techniques to my ESL students.
Best course ever! I learned a lot about how to learn effectively and I am eager to implement the techniques I learned from this course in my day to day learning processes. It is a fun time learning the course. Highly recommend if you want to get better at learning!
Good explanation of learning mechanism, tips on improving productivity and surpressing procrastination, worth taking for all people who are either currently learning or plan to learn again (like in my case, i took it almost 10 years after graduated from university)
I loved it!Barbara is a kind and lovely teacher.For everyone who's out there learning something, this course is for you. Even if you're an expert or newbie, if you're an athlete or a programmer. This course will take you further into developing the skills you want.
One of the most important courses I've ever taken... and I've already recommended this to nearly a dozen people.I strongly feel this should be a mandatory prerequisite at every stage of formalized education (middle-school, high school, college, grad school, etc...)
Although, I had used or heard of some of the topics, going further into how the mind works and why those exercises work well was fantastic. The small chunks in each vid were great and the optional reading and videos were full of "easter eggs". Will be implementing!
Really useful no matter your age or what you are studying. You learn some really interesting things about how your brain works, as well as practical tips that will help enhance your learning. I'm really looking forward to using some of these techniques in practice.
At the outset a big THANKS to both the teachers. It was a wonderful coursei have got many tips about learning . It was amazing to know how our neurons develop . Pomeduro , perseverance and practice are the best techniques i learnt in this course. Thanks once again.
This course with its step by step approach and the brilliantly explained teachings of Barb and Terry was a blessing.  The tests had even fun answers which made me laugh. This is a course recommend for anyone, including people who think they are no good at studying!
This course is highly recommended especially if this is your start of Coursera journey. It is quite helpful in improving learning abilities in aspects of efficiency and effectiveness. This is also the footstone for subsequent learnings of other areas of interests !
One of the best courses I have ever taken. Amazingly inspiring. It is truly systematic and integrated course that introduces how to learn more effectively and efficiently. Really appreciated Dr.Barbara Oakley, Dr.Terrence Sejnowski, and all the team. Thank you all.
Awesome first experience on Coursera. The teachers and the material are simply awesome. I can only recommend this course if you are looking to learn techniques to help you learn, fight procrastination, and build the confidence to face new intellectual challenges :)
It was my first course on Coursera and it was so awesome! Very helpful personalities, always lovely to listen to and learn from. Thank you so much for all the work that you have put into this project and course, it was a tremendous help for me and countless others.
Learning how to learn is a great course for all who want to learn. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and Dr. Barbara Oakley explain all the key aspects of learning. After completing this course I knew many key ideas, concepts etc. that help me to better my overall potential.
It is a great course, very easy and helpful. It will make you think in a more efficient way when learning a new subject. It is also very short, but it will leave you wanting more, and the optional further readings and interviews are really interesting and helpful.
I was skeptical about this course in the beginning. Based on the feedback I still decided to try it out and was pleasantly surprised. Extremely useful content is presented in a very simple and understandable manner. The course is very easy to finish and to digest.
Learning How to Learn not only taught me how to learn new skills but showed me the science behind it. What I learned in this course will help me throughout my life as I continue to learn and explore new things. I only wish I had known about this course in college!
Excellent course, with top class and wonderful teachers! Thank you so much Prof. Barbara Oakley and Prof. Terry Sejnowsky for you very comprehensive and pedagogic approach towards learning mechanisms. A special mention to your great sense of humour and simplicity.
I loved the fast-paced, engaging videos in this course! I didn't realize how poorly I was learning until Learning How to Learn. There are so many useful tips, tricks, and tidbits in the MOOC. If you want to enhance the way you retain informstion, take this course!
Thanks to this MOOC, learning new material and concepts will be so much more enjoyable and efficient, as well as teaching what I've learned to my current students (I'm a Language tutor and DIrector) Thank you Barb and Terry for such an awesome learning experience.
I can't stress enough how amazing this class is. I wish I had taken it before my bachelors degree, I'm sure I would have done even better! Two topics that were very relevant to me in this course were how to tackle procrastination and focused vs. diffused thinking.
I have learnt so much from this course.It's help me understand how brain works better, how to study more effectively, how to prepare for test and so much more.Thanks to the professors and staff that make this course available and free. I appreciate your hard work.
I would recommend this to anybody, that's how powerful, useful and pure it is. Thank you, especially to Dr. Barbara Oakley, for teaching me skills that I will gratefully use throughout life, and for helping me to understand the bigger picture of how we learn. 5/5.
It is a great course and a life time learning. It explores all the concepts that will help in personal and professional growth. I recommend everyone who is looking for a way to learn how to learn and stop procrastinating. The assignments are intelligently modeled.
I don't have too much to say. However this course is highly suggested if you are having hard times studying and focusing. It helped me manage how to study and also I've become more focused and aware of how I was learning. It helped me out in everyday life as well.
It is a small investment of my time with big returns. I now have a much better understanding of how brain works (in lay man terms) in learning, and some tools to help me become a better learner. I recommend this course to anyone who aspires to a life-long learner.
In depth yet clear this course has helped me so much in the few short weeks it has taken to complete it. I thoroughly recommend it for anyone with learning anxiety or procrastination issues, but also those who want to broaden their learning techniques. It's great!
Great information!  Since I've taken this class, I've been able to use the opportunities where the mental tools discussed can be used on a daily basis.  I've also shared this information with my friends and family. This is definitely a course everyone should take.
Very excellent course. I have learnt a lot of learning skills and English from the class. The course is very interesting and plentiful, I even can't stop listening to the lessons ob by one. What's more, I have been unconsciously using the learning skills to learn.
I loved this course.  I can't tell you how many people I've told to take it.  In addition to helping myself learn new/old topics, I am looking forward to using my new knowledge in order to help my children succeed in school.  thank you for such a wonderful course.
You will have a good time during this course. But learn a lot about how we think, how we remember, how exercise affects the brain, how insomnia affects us, how to stay persistent, how to change habits ... how to effectively change your life. Great recommendation!
It truly shapes the way of my thinking to be more structured, although I cannot say it scientifically with references as proof, but this course must be owned and undertaken by all students, employers, and very important to those who are in the educational sector.
Great information on how to study effectively. These concepts are easily applied to any course or future learning you may endeavor in. Some things you may already do by habit, but it's good to know they are the correct practice and you should continue doing them.
This course is just wonderful! Throughout this four weeks of studying I gained a lot: powerful techniques,some knowledge about how your brain works and other methods  that allow me to learn more efficiently. Thank you a lot! This course has become my inspiration.
One of the best courses I've ever done.  Very informative . It gave me a great  deal insight into process of learning and also suggested some great tools to improve my productivity. Last but not the least, It teaches us how to enjoy the whole process of learning.
Dr. Barbara Oakley is brilliant! Learning How to Learn is a fun and engaging course! I've learned valuable techniques to improve short term and long term memory that really help! I'm so glad I signed up for this class! I can't stop talking about it to my friends!
I really enjoyed this course. The pomodoro technique helped me to create discipline in everything I do now. I learned things that I will keep for my life. I truly recommend this course specially for someone that is getting ready for tests and qualification exams.
Great course and the teachers motivate us. I find a lot of information about learning and how to improve thnigs in my life too. It is well explained and the videos are very clear. I have also improved my english very much through this course :-). Thanks for this.
Excelent! The techniques presented in the course are easy to understand and to put in practice. The course has the potential to change the life of people that are dedicated to learning because it teaches to learn better, more effectively and without wasting time!
At the very beginning of the course, I felt disengaged, But now I strongly say this THE course every learner should take up. The course has nicely crafted with a blend of Brain function facts and learning skills. I submit my heartfelt gratitude to both teachers.
Excellent course introducing several techniques and the science behind effective learning and mastering of subjects, no matter which subject. I strongly recommend this course - even an effective learner will come out learning at least 1 or 2 new tips and tricks.
I love how easy to learn in this course and how useful and easy understanding and using in the real life. Most of all, I love the optional review videos cuz it shows how successful ones use some tricks in this course and their own tricks to deal with their jobs.
By completing this course now i able to control my brain for learning something new and specially learn how to chunk and how to apply pamadora technique also learn how focus and diffuse mode exactly work. I specially thanks to learning how to learn team members.
From this course i was able to learn many new skills that i can put to real like situations when learning a new subject or when trying to solve a problem. Thank you to the team of learning how to learn, you have helped me to understand my learning a lot more. :)
A  wonderful and rich course that will make you reconsider and review your learning habits. I enjoyed this course very much and thanks to Dr.Terrence and Dr.Barbra for putting together these nice course materials. I recommend this to everyone who loves to learn.
One of the basics when learning something new! This is quite a quick course, and much worth it's time! With lot of insights and tips on how our brains and bodies are functioning when learning, it gives some new angles to tackle our studying life. I recommend it!
The course provides incredible tools to improve and make our learning process more efficient. Moreover we can understand why the techniques helps us based on science.It absolutely change my way of studying and moreover gave me a powerful reason to exercise more.
I cannot even begin to describe how helpful this course was. LISTEN TO THE OPTIONAL INTERVIEWS, they have some incredible people come on and they were by far my favorite part. I have shared this course with my family and cannot tell people enough how good it is.
This was one of the best courses so far for me. I'm absolutely grateful to all the teachers for such an interesting topics and tools. This course inspired me to learn more, and now I have so many cool tools and features how to make my learning easy and also FUN.
Excellent ! This course should be taught to all students and people who seek for mind and knowledge prosperity. I enjoyed to learn every idea shared in this course and the way it was presented. Many thanks to all people who worked to achieve this successful work
im very happy because this course was the first one i had taken . because im sure it will help me to understand and facilitate any other course that i will take next. im happy to say " I learnt how to learn " thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
One of the best online courses. I wish I found it years ago. The main and core lessons will be helpful in my life. I will suggest the the students not to omit anything like additional material, because they can develop their understanding more there.Best wishes!
Wonderful! Coming across this course on the Coursera is such a bliss. What I learned in the course totally changed my views and attitudes toward learning. I would recommend anyone who desires to have a better life to register to this course. You won't regret it!
A great help. I think the course has saved me lots of time which would otherwise have been spent on pointless repetition. Instead I will now spend more time organising my studies, looking for study groups and recalling  what I think I have learnt to test myself.
Very useful and good structured course. Add in the reccomended reading books and you'll ease your studies a lot with the insights gained here. The only minus for me in this course is a technical one, the audio should be louder in my opinion. Apart from that 5/5!
This is an amazing course and the companion text is awesome. In just a few weeks I was able to share theses skills in a workshop I was facilitating on text taking and each one of the graduate students who attended was able to pass using some very basic technics.
This course is a MUST if you are learning something new, as mentioned it focus more on the process of learning rather than the product, which is usually ignored. a lot of useful techniques that you can apply to grasp materials or even in your day to day workday
Excellent course. Learning How to Learn !!Fantastic Faculty Dr Barbara Oakley.  Not only the content was rich the way Dr Barbara oakley led the course was really remarkable and interesting to keep moving forward and keep learning.  My compliments and gratitude.
this course was very important because it covered how we can learn objectively, with simple and practical techniques. Complementary material with interviews showed how important personalities use these techniques to increase their skills. It was very inspiring!
This is really helpful and I advice students to take this as a prerequisite learning course before taking on a new course. It helped me a lot and I wish to help others too by sharing what Barbara Oakley and the others shared with me. Thank you so much creators!
A powerful reminder that learning and memory are not innate talents but learned behaviors that benefit from guidance and coaching. I found this class to be useful and inspiring well beyond my expectations and goal for the course. I highly recommend this course.
I enjoyed this course.  It showed me that my first attempt at college was could have been much better if I had the tools presented in this course.  Learning is a little more challenging 50 years later, but I am enjoying the work and plan to never stop learning.
I enjoyed this course as I gains some valuable tools for my toolkit. I have been applying most of the techniques learnt in this module I just did not know the right name for them. The course also reinforced my understanding of the techniques I am accustomed to.
This is a course for teachers and students alike. Only when we know how we should study can we study a subject well. By spending these four weeks, you may save four months or four years of aimless studying that does not return the results you would like to see.
Wonderful, though I have learned a few of the techniques through experience, now I got a neurological perspective on these powerful learning techniques. It was a pleasurable journey while traversing through the course tuning daily to the musings of instructors.
Nice course that will help you to learn more efficiently. I've already known some of the course material before starting (importance of sleep, importance of exercise), but the course still taught me enough valuable info (importance of recall, etc.).Recommended!
I am working professional. This course has helped me understand new concepts like diffuse mode of thinking, and help in getting insight into other concepts like interleaving, recall, pomodoro, memory techniques, etcThank you for this great course on learning!!!
Great overview of effective study techniques and memory tricks. Well worth the investment of time; these are tools you could use to be a more efficient and less-stressed learner for the rest of your life. Course also deals with procrastination and test anxiety.

Thanks for the course. It was great to learn different techniques for learning and that im not too old to learn. Im taking away a lot of useful information. I look forward to using the techniques youve taught to master many more things in my life! All the best!

Great class; I've gained simple, effective strategies to improve my ability to learn. I only hope that other curriculums can incorporate concepts that were discussed in this class, so that more people may apply these strategies at an earlier stage of learning.
This course was so practical in the sense that, as a Middle School teacher I could apply almost everything learned. Thank you for opening up a whole new world to me in terms of how my brain works. I was also able to understand better why I do the things I do.
This course is great and has broadened my understanding of how learning works. It teaches valuable tips on how to avoid procrastination, learn material effectively, succeed in tests, etc. This course has many benefits to everyday life, and I highly recommend.

Very useful course. I already improved my learning habits. Every student should know these mechanisms how our brain works and also use the tips included in the course. I recommend to watch the optional interviews with people that mastered learning techniques.
Informative an inspiring course taught by dedicated and enthusiastic teachers/professors. Not everything is mould-breaking new but you get useful advice and tools (> the pomodoro technique) to work with. Was my first course on coursera an I iked it very much.
A great course, it shows you your mistakes in learning indirectly, talking about techniques and the science inside your brain. I surely recommend it to people who are thinking about start a study routine on different areas, whether they are usual or new ones.
This course provides techniques for learning new skills and developing the skills that you want to learn. I found most of the techniques and information on how the brain retains information particularly useful and will be employing them as I learn new skills.
This course looks easy at first glance and it essentilly is, but work as hard as you can and do all the assignments. Even the optional ones because, thats the only way you are going the maximum out your own time, work and out of the lecturers time and effort.
Essential knowledge you can use for a lifetime of learning. I wish this course was taught to me at an early age. I recommend this course to anyone who is attempting to go down the path of self education, furthering education, or even attending formal classes.
This is a very good course. It tells you the effective ways of learning and studying. It also tells you about the bad practices that you should avoid while learning new concepts. I highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to learn things effectively.

The course was amazing. I would recommend this to a lot of people wanting to gain insight on how their mind works during learning and how to maximize their effectiveness during it. This is a very well made MOOC and I would like to praise the creators for it.
Fantastic course with lots of material and ideas to learn more effectively. Barbara is a great talker, and the videos are built up with great points at a good pace. Especially interesting is all the extra material that is recommended, and all the interviews.
I wish the schools or colleges I attended years ago had offered a basic course on how to learn!  This course is outstanding and very useful for someone genuinely interested in how to learn and teach others.  I recommend serious students enrol for the course.
This is a perfect beginner course for anyone interested in improving their learning skills. The materials mentioned in the course are generally known, however the insight of the materials is what made this course such an excellent course. Highly recommended.

A really wonderful and informative course! As someone who got lost in the amazingly useless world of procrastination, this course brought to light some easy ways of tackling problems faced when learning, all presented in a fun, light-hearted way! Loved it.
This course has been very informative, and offers simple yet powerful techniques to enhance one's learning abilities and hone one's skill. The techniques have been backed by research and scientific facts which helps one to understand why they work so well.
Its a good course to be done by any professional person. The learning habit is always the best tool to develop ourselves, and this course "promodoro", "chunking", "mini-tests", "testing check list" methods are the best way to grasp the learning attitude...
This course is really good if you want to improve your way to do the things in the class or in the job. I thought have the right study methods but I was wrong. In this course I have learned that more sometimes is not better. A lot of thanks to the authors.
I feel that this course has been a totally enriching experience. I thank both instructors for putting everything into making the course as complete and motivating as possible. I hope to share your ideas with many people and of course recommend this course.
On seeing the title of this course, I was curious to take it. And I must say, it was wonderful. Thanks to Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for their wonderful sessions and tips to learn better. This course changed my perspective of how learning should be :)
This is a missing puzzle found to live a life on your own conditions. Without this the journey will lack clarity. Watch 25 minutes content of this course on x2 speed every or every other day until it's completed. See you on the the other side of greatness!
I enjoyed the course very much and learned a lot. Thank you to my teachers. I have a sugestion that is this is a wonderful subject to learn but the time is too short for so much information! Now I will practice all the new information I learned. Thank you!
An excellent course which should be taken by students, teachers and anyone interested in education. I enjoyed 'learning how to learn' backed up by scientific evidence and a range of resources. Well done Barb and Terry for an engaging and fantastic program!
Excellent Course.Having taken the Actuarial Exams for the Society of Actuaries, I found myself having acquired a lot of the techniques that the professors mentioned. However I also learned a lot of novel new things. I would recommend this course to anyone!
This is truly a course for EVERYBODY! No kidding. How can you be a student or life long learner and not learn how to learn? Best of all, it is exciting but also challenging in the sense that you will be hearing some things for the very first time. Welcome.
I would basically recomend this course to anyone interested in improving his learning skills, in any area. It is simple, yet effective and deep in its lessons. Here is truly an oportunity to change your life by changing your learning habits and techniques.
A well segmented course, which helps explain various essential concepts of learning - even if some of it seems familiar or common sense, this breaks it out down well. The companion book is also worth buying for reference and to explain in a bit more depth.
A great first course to take if you are getting back into the groove of advancing your education. Barbra Oakley is a wonderfully motivating person and has great techniques as well as the other professor who's name i can't seem to spell. Thank you so much!
I like the course. It taught me in a structured way, what years of trial and error tells. I believe there are still tools not available to allow us to practice these concepts. I discuss this with my kids and they said also this should be taught at school.
Right now i feel more confidence when i realize a test. The information was usefull and recreative because they give you more perspectives about how to learn. Im glad to complete this couse and I love the teachers and their greatest topics and interviews.
Good course that has taught me ways to analyze the way I am learning something new. There's a lot of helpful tips and tricks that can make you a much more effective learner. Recommend this course to anyone who wants to increase productivity in their life.
Great course! I needed an update on learning techniques. The instructors are brilliant. Everthing was clearly explained. Sometimes the sound was too low, especialy during interviews, but no big deal. Few graphics but effective and fun (love the zombie! ).
Amazing way to discover the shortcomings in us. I took this course to help my high school daughter to understand her subjects well. I am amazed by the way it helped me also.I strongly recommend this to the students, professionals(both young and seasoned).
This course help me to understand why I didn't get good marks in my school days, even after working so hard. It helps me to understand that we should focus on Process rather than Product, as in long term it is the Process which will drive our motivation..
As a professor at a small private college, this course has reminded me some of the issues that students face when learning new subjects.  It has given me the tools to better explain my content and has taught me techniques that work. I am grateful for this
Great course! Provided a lot of insights and helpful tips! I followed this course after I switched jobs and started working in the Learning and Development area. I believe every student should follow this course because it will help them in their studies!
This is a great course for anyone.  It helps you understand how your brain works and gives you concrete techniques on how to take advantage of how we learn best.  This course will positively effect how you learn in all the other courses and in daily life.
I am 32. I wish I knew about this when I was 14. It seems so obvious that because you learn anything you should learn how to learn. This course should be mandatory for every kid or young adult. Everyone deserves to be equipped with better learning skills.
Excellent, Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski are great teachers. They had helped me with chunks of scientific knowledge for improvements in the way I used to study. The course's pace is great, it's very enjoyable watch its lectures. I strongly recommend.
This has been a very eye opening experience.  The techniques and tools provide me with a kit to use in my continued learning, both professionally and personally.  I will be honored to recommend this class to ANYONE who just wants to learn.Thank you,Eddie

Loved this course! I've always had trouble getting things to stick in my long term memory when studying, and now I know why!! I'm walking away with several new approaches to learn the things that are important.  It will be interesting to see the results.
Fantastic course.  Wish I would have taken this years ago to learn and retain concepts better.  The course is very well taught and I love how it doesn't expire like so many other courses as it gives me time to review concepts and truly go at my own pace.
It's a fantastic course,very useful for students and everybody.Thanks for coursera for offering this course.I have learn alot by this course.Thank you so much for all the teachers who tough us very well,and all of the team of coursera for your hard work.
It really did what it told me it would do: it helped me learn how to learn. Before I started, I had hated learning, I had had enough, but now I'm excited to learn new things (my final semester starts tomorrow, so it came at the very best time it could)!!
Incredible course, with really valuable information! If you are interested in how your brain works and what you can do to make it more efficient this is a MUST! A very big THANK YOU to the lecturers and their efforts to bring this knowledge to the world!

We just jump into learning in schools and continue to struggle in it through our life. But we should stop for a while and see how we learn and check if we can improve our learning ability. By taking this course, you will improve on learning efficiently.
I was really happy the way professor Barbara Oakley and Prof.  
Terrence Sejnowski unfolded the secret to learn efficiently. I was always intrigued about the best way to learn. Thanks Dr. Barbara and Dr. Sejnowski for making things interesting and easy.
The course gives an insight into your brain and its powers and limitations.  The best thing to do is to experiment the learning techniques on this course itself. The tone of the course instructors is also very friendly. Nothing is difficult, if you try.
Do yourself a favor and take this class!  It has made me a believer.  I believe that I can successfully learn things that I never thought I could!  There are so many tools given in this course to help you become a successful learner!  Thank you Barbara!

This course shows me how bad was my studying habits and help me to enhance it. There is so many good techniques how to study and the explanation of neural processes are'nt missing. It's pretty useful course and Barbara Oakley is very sympathetic person!
A great course! I wish someone would have thought me all this when I was younger! Eye opening and very useful knowledge with applicable techniques. All my misconceptions about the brain and learning were debunked in a second. Recommended for everybody!
I recommend this course to all students that believe they are not good students, just to know they can be best students, keep practicing with these tips and you will see you can learn everything you want, even if it’s the most difficult item like math.
Amazing sessions that changed my view totally about how to learn things. Now I feel like more equipped as I venture further into the world, especially that I am gearing up do an online doctorate program.  Thank you very much, and shout out to Coursera!
Definitely a course that one should not miss if he or she want to learn new subject after school. This course provides so many simple and powerful tool, with their mechanism well explained in the videos. I just love it and will recommend to my friends.
Thank's to this course I have learned how to effectively study my assignments, how to avoid overlearning and illusion of competence. Every topic was totally clear and understandable.I would definitely recommend this course to all my friends and family.
Simple explainanation of complex and useful suggestion. Great course. Professor Oakley has a friendly and effective way to easy present concepts , it is impossible to misunderstan her. Suggestion: Please, do take Professor Oakley's course on mindshift.
This was one of the most rewarding courses I have taken. It's also very conveniently the most time-effective one because it teaches you a broad variety of tips and "cheats" for hacking into your own mind and making yourself feel and BE more productive.
Excellent course, as from my mechanical engineering point of view. This course should be integrated into every year of primary and high school education. I am changing my study technique to utilize this course's tools in my second undergraduate degree.
It is a very good course for knowing how our brains works and how to make it work better.Maybe some of the ideas you have known before or you don't think it effective enough,  but it does give some new perspectives for your learning experience. Thanks!
I learned a great deal.  The pace of the course was perfect, the lectures were exciting and clearly lead.It was a pleasure 'learning'.  Thanks! If you both (together, or separately) do another class - please let me know.   I would like to 'learn' more.
Honestly, one of the best courses i've ever had. Thanks to everyone who participated in this course. I really learned a lot in this course especially how to tackle procrastination. Now I know that there is a Zombie inside me and how to deal with him :)
I love this course so much! Love the new ways of learning how to learn. Was wondering is there any relevant subject on learning how to control our emotion? I found out that both topics are connected as emotion disturbance is also a barrier of learning.
Great treasure trove of useful tools and techniques to help you get the most of your studying time - whether you're an actual formal student or you're learning independently, and regardless of the subject you are aiming to master. Great choice, always!
This is what everyone should attend to develop these skills if you are struggling in learning things and to expertise if you already good at learning.I am very thankful to Barbara and Terry for their wonderful lectures. Would love to join their schools
This course was outstanding in content and delivery, with a great mix of facts, examples and practice, as well as good tips. I am already using the tactics in everyday life! Worth doing if you're a teacher, a parent, or just someone who loves learning.
Great learning! I started to apply my knowledge since the beginning to my work and to help my kids as well.Thanks Barbara you have inspired me  and kept me interested all the time (no an  easy task :)) I can't wait to take another course from you.Dalia
This is a really good course for... well, basically for everyone. It helped me to bust my learning (I'm a musician keen on learning languages). The instructor is very knowledgeable, and there is a lot of good humor and powerful metaphors in the course.
The techniques and knowledge I learned in this course will always be very useful to me. Fortunately I attended the course. It was educational and fun at the same time - zombies-. My teachers (Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley) were great. Thanks !
If you'd like to learn the scientific bases of learning and increase your efficiency in learning, this course is the best toolkit for your lifelong learning journey. Appreciate for their efforts; Professor Barbara Oakley and Professor Terry Sejnowski.
A very exciting, encouraging, and life-changing course. This really helps to make the learning easy for the tough subjects. The tricks and suggestions given in the course helps us to remember the things very well and perform better in the examination.
I really love this course. I will recommend this to my friends and peers. Material was easy to understand. Techniques were simple to apply in our day-to-day life. I wish I did this course before going to college. Better late than never... Learn away..
I used audible to read the book "A Mind for Math and Science" and was fascinated with many things mentioned in the book. I took a plunge to take this course to deeply understand the nuances in learning. Hoping to put it to effect now into other areas.
Absolutely useful tips on learning. In this journey of life, I believe we will forever learn new things. Having the skill and extraordinary tips on how to learn will make it far more enjoyable and easy to learn anything you want to learn in this life.

It is a great course for learning new techniques that will help you learn anything if you apply them. Of course, you'll have to adapt those techniques to your circumstances and what fits best for you and your activities, but they sure will be helpful.
Very useful and important information. Thank you for the effort you put to create and maitain this course, it is very valuable for me even if I completed my academic education. The knowledge I gained is applicable in my life and my jurney in learning.
A fantastic learning. I did not know this much about my brain and how it complements the learning. The tutors patience on the subject and explaining it exactly the way the techniques have been introduced is amazing. This is a must course for everyone!
It is easy and interesting course about tools that can help us to learn more effective. I found a few new ideas. Learning is more sophisticated thing than I thought before. The knowledge how our brain works defiantly will help me learn better. Thanks!
This course is very helpful, I love turning this on in the morning - as a form of podcast. Little changes they suggest, if implemented, have a profound impact on line. Also, try yoga and meditation - great augmentations to improve cognitive abilities.
Easy to understand, beneficial and practical tips for "learning how to learn."I will try to use some of these techniques- I am halfway through this course- and I will come back and add more to my review after I have completed this course.So far, good!
This course is absolutely fantastic. As a 30 year old with a full time time job, this course has changed my approach towards learning and has given me the courage to learn and start new things, even at this age. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
A class that I think should be a requisite at schools. I had discovered some of this techniques on my own the hard way, after completing a bachelor's degree.Wish I had taken this class before. Although, the tips will still help me through grad school.
Spectacular! The relevant content was presented in the easiest way possible. Whether you simply want to be a better test taker or a lifelong learner, the learning techniques and tips discussed here will be beneficial. I highly recommend this course :)
The course is really good and helpful for student, teachers, mothers and fathers who still helping their children during study courses. it brings you to human ability to learn by then you support in appropriate way.I recommend this course to every one

This course is excellent to open your eyes your own brain and tips to learn better. I really wished I had this course when I was a student. I will keep these tips in mind for my future learning sessions and for everyday life ! Practice makes perfect !
Definitely something I will recommend to anyone that even mentions learning. I now suffer from less stress when I get stuck, and don't panic if something doesn't go as I planned. Made my learning and life in general far easier to handle and thrive at.
This is a magnificent course that should be a prerequisite before taking any other course. It helps you understand learning itself and put you in a better position to learn faster and better thus making learning more enjoyable rather than be a burden.
This is a really awesome course teaching us lot of tit bits on making our brain work better. Understanding a lot on the way we do, learn and think helps us do better. I will recommend it for anyone involved in a passion for learning new things........
This course should be taught as a requirement at all universities.  To all language learners... please learn how to learn, do not waist your time on silly strategies! This is the way I should have been taught all along.  Thank you for this opportunity
I wish I had had access to this course years ago. It not only improves the way you learn so you learn more deeply but it reduces the amount of time you would spend studying without necessarily improving your understanding or retention of the material.
A great experience that helped me with understanding many aspects of learning and how our mind works. If you have time and you are struggling with some sort of blockages in you learning experience, I highly recommend you at least try out this course.
I love this class, helped me a lot. It can tell that professor did devote themselves a lot . cause the final test has 27 items. I learned several online classes from Coursera,this one is the only one to integrate  all "key points together. Well done.
Quite an extraordinaire experience ... when you think "you know that !" this course shows you that nothing can be taken for granted. Learning is a lifelong pursuit ... it is never too late to learn how to learn in a more rewarding and effective way !
Thanks the instructors for this excellent  course. I have learned so many techniques which i didn't during my school/Collage days. Pomodoro Technique is i like the most as it strengthen your focus on the topic you are learning.         Thanks. pankaj
Very useful course for anyone hoping to maximize their learning time. There are ideas presented here that are very powerful and not widely known. The material is very accessible and I would recommend this course to anyone from 6th grade to a retiree.
This course was broken down in a very digestible way. The videos and constant quizzes helped me to cement the ideas and concepts into my brain while going through the material. I learned a lot and am already applying it in different areas of my life!
I feel that I can use my brain abilities wider now. I was informed by this course how to avoid obstacles during learning new information and subject. Thanks for teachers, I appreciate their efforts too much. Excellent course. Sincerely Yours Jasurbek
This course helped us to understand how to learn better with the techniques and tools explained. Definitely a must watch if we need to rethink our learning process and get better at it. Thank you for the authors of this course to put in a great show.
That was really amazing, the topic at first seemed tough for me to pick up. But soon become interesting as it progressed. Quizzes awakened my curiosity. That was all nice time to be with course. Thanks for a great opportunity. Good luck to the team .
It's an amazing course that teaches me theories and techniques which refresh my concept of "learning".Easy to learn and practice. I think it would be very useful for my way expanding knowledge map.Very nice instructor and great efforts, thanks a lot.
This is a life-changing course. I struggled with learning techniques all my life, not even knowing, what i lacked? Now, i feel like i have the tools that can make study fun for me, as it should be. Thank you Dr. Sejnovski and Dr Oakley. Lots of love.
Really insightful material and points about learning. Everyone should take this course to enhance their study habits, internalize their learning subjects and essentially change their view of learning as a whole (at least this is what happened to me).
This course was very fun to take, I enjoyed watching the optional interviews they had at the end of each module. And the main concepts were always brought up in a review so there were no surprises during the tests. I would recommend this to a friend.
If you want to know what is the right way to learn this is the course. It will explain to you what is going on in your brain while studying/learning. It also points out the misconceptions regarding the methods of learning. Recommend for all learners.
I have learned powerful techniques that are sure to help me in the future when I pursue my second bachelor's degree. I can now see the many errors I made with my studies during my pursuit of my engineering degree. Thank you for putting this together.
Great lesson! I've got a lot of useful information and handy techniques about how to learn. It's the kind of things that I can use myself and apply to teaching. I've also improved my self-confidence through great assignment comments by my Mooc mates.
The content of the course and structure of learning are just great! Visual side  - not so good. It's not beautiful.  It's quite the opposite.. BUT I still think it's a great course. It  would have been even greater if it would be beautifully "packed"
I'm pretty good at math without consciously knowing why (I used to assume it a math talent). Now I realize the core function behind learning. And I become more confident to conquer other fields of hard science such as statistics and computer science.
Excellent Course! I consider it a portal that would enable one achieve more and better, and most importantly understand and master tough and challenging subjects. It's the tool that would enroll at more courses in Coursera and earn more certificates.
I found the course very informative.  I now have a full toolbox of learning techniques.  The information about procrastination made me take a hard look in the mirror.  I started using the techniques to overcome procrastination before the course end.
Exceptional course which clearly helped me understand my behaviour and why I put things aside .What i learned I'm using since day one to tackle all skills studying problems in my life.Dr. B. Oakley and Dr. T. Sejnowski are awesome people and mentors
One of the most excellent course on the intricacies of human learning. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to improve on the quality of self-learning and learning more about techniques of overcoming procrastination and mental blocks (einstellung).
So glad I attended this course. The valuable things I’ve learnt here are not only useful for myself but also my children in future when they start elementary school. Love listening to the lecturers - I find myself looking forward for more each time!
*it was very very interesting*i learned a lot of things,and corrected a lot of my thoughts  *all doctors have a wonderful attitude*some times there was difficult expressions but in total it was good*i think the Arabic translation need more enhancing
It has made me able to see learning again as a whole new way.I highly recommend that you help your youngers complete this course. They will be influnced much more. Hope to use things I learned from this course. To add, it hasalready helped me a lot.
This course contains many pieces of information that you might already know, but with an explanation of neuroscientific and psychological basis. I am sure that it was really helpful for me and boosted my desire to study as well. Thank you very much!
God I wish I've studied this course when I was back in the University! Nevertheless, I would suggest everyone give it a try as it doesn't require much effort and yet provides you with powerful tools to study and learn new materials more efficiently.
This course has helped me increase my academic skills and it has also helped me in other ways such as boosting my confidence and motivation. Take This Course because it WILL change your life for the better.Earnestly from sunny Oceanside CA,Patrick R

A transformative course.  As a high school teacher, I've shared this course with so many colleagues as we seek to improve the study-skills of our students.  One of the best short courses I've taken, MOOC or otherwise.  Thank you Barbara and Terence.
I really loved having taken this course. Classes are taught in an incredible and passionate way. Great gratitude to the teachers, the interviewees, the colleagues to all who have shared their knowledge with us and in such a beautiful way. Gratitude!
Great fundamentals about learning. Clarifies how to learn after years of what now feels like wasted school that was unable to place the wrong emphasis on how to learn effectively. Makes learning feels like less of a chore and more interesting again.
My first course on coursera. It's a great start - very interesting and inspiring course. I recommend it to anyone, who wanna try courses. You'll learn how to rid off procrastionation, manage your task, prepare to tests, use a pomodoro technique etc.
Barbara Oakley is very thorough in her teaching skills.  The best part about this class is she dis show what the problem is, how it happens and the solution.  Great, great class.  I encourage everyone to take this course before taking other classes.

This course is LIFE ALTERING! I've even read the book by Barbara Oakley - "A Mind for Numbers" from cover to cover and I've absolutely loved the book as well. I do plan to read the book twice a year so as to cement the lessons into my learning self.
Highly recommended. After taking this course I learnt that how my study methods were absolutely wrong. I used to spend more time than needed because I actually didn't the right approach. This is something we were never taught in schools or colleges.
I think the difficulty of the course and progress is very suitable for beginners, you can see very attentively when producing, I looked up some information in learning, think that teacher is very clear. So this course I'm very satisfied, very happy!
The mental tools
presented are really helpful. And I'm happy to see that I've been using some of
the techniques even before the course, but now that I'm conscious about them, things will be easier to understand and I'll
benefit more from my studies.
Thank you so much Barbara and Terrence. I have learned so much during this course. Both fundamental knowledge to understand how my mind works and practical techniques to use my brain, and my body, more efficiently to learn more, faster and happier.
This course is  very  good and informative regarding to learning.it is really helping me.this course really help to change me and overcome my bad habits.thanks to coursera , barbara oakley madam and terry sejnowaski sir for providing us the course.
Excellent training, powerfull tips, a very productive way to invest your time! 
I would recommend this training to everyone, from primary school children to highly educated proffesionals, there is for sure something to learn or recall for everyone!
I highly recommend the course as it is the foundation of a pyramid of knowledge for every other MOOC out there. You might have known some content subconsciously but here you have it backed with science. High five! Thank You Barbara Oakley! Спасибо)
The course is excellent. Both lecturer are really careful when selecting the topic, and they use simple and easy ways to make students understand the key points. By having tests, students can review and remember most of the lecture. Thanks so much!
Thank you for a very helpful and meaningful course. I shall use the knowledge that I have learned here during my future studies! My boyfriend and I did this course together and he found it very helpful too :p Yes, I am the boyfriend. It is true! :P
This is great course, and I have learned a lot useful ideas and skills from it about how to learn in a better way.   I will definitely try to apply what I have learned here into my daily life.  Also, I will recommend my friends to take this course!
A very thought provoking course, with practical tips that you can really apply in practice. Some of the presentations were a little 'unpolished' but this made the course feel quite relaxed and enjoyable.A nice course, well structured and explained.
I enjoyed this course very much. I realized that I really do not know how to learn, but this course has opened a new door to teach her how to learn. Thank you very much to the teachers for their involvement and for the good thoughts we have shared!
Thank you so much, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, I have been a better learner! I'm a more confident individual now because of the sense of satisfaction I get from 100% completeness of daily to-do lists. Love the Pomodoro technique.
I am so grateful to have found this course. I am an undergrad student and I struggle with my science course exams. This is definitely useful! I will do my best to incorporate these techniques into my learning in order to be more prepared for exams.
This is one of the most useful course I take. You can use the techniques taught in every part of your life. Learning is what makes us human, and learning how to learn makes your life a lot easier. Thank you Barbara Oakley, I learned a lot from you!
This was really a great and easy course! Not only did I learn useful tips, methods and techniques, but I also began to see my learning in a new way. I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants to learn more effectively and better!
I did not expect this course to be so good. The content and the way is shown are very efficient and the professionals Barb Oakley and Sejnowski have been great teachers after all. Everyone should take the course to face life with other perspective.
A quick and easily accessible course to pick up learning skills. I've taken on all they have preached to immediately improve my skills of generating and embedding knowledge, plus sharing these great new skills with others. Great work and thank you!
Inspiring, engaging, liberating and delivered in an easy-to-get-and-apply manner. And for people who want to learn - that is the purpose of Coursera after all ;-) - what better way than to get the right mindset, tips and tools? Highly recommend it.
Amazing and clear course. It really helped me discover new ways of learning which I hadn't payed attention to before. It also made me realize of some mistakes I've had in the past while studying. I am already applying what I've learned as we speak.
This is the course that every learner, more precisely every human being should go through at least once in a lifetime.  For, me this course helped to understand how my brain works and how to make things for it to bring out much better performance.
Great course!Valuable concepts and recommendations to improve learning, with a scientific background. For those who aim to learn better to really be able to do new things, this is the course to take before going through the new learning objective.
This was a very helpful and informative course. It showed me how important it is to learn how to learn and understand our brain more. I'm sure that many of the leaning techniques that were discussed in the course will save so much time and effort.
It is a very cool course and I would advise anyone to follow it, especially those who have problems with studying either because of procrastination or because of not knowing how to study correctly. Thank you so much for this course. A lot of love.
Very good course for all the learners and all ages, I wish I learn this course since I was younger, it might help me a lot for sure. I recommend for the people that have teenagers the tips in this course will help your kids reach the goal of life.
The difficult concepts are served to us in a more delightful manner. Interviewing famous brain hackers describing their strategies while working on their tasks gives special edge over the concepts.Feeling fortunate after going through this course.
This was a very enlighting, powerful and precise course that helped me revisit my learning techniques and my beliefs about learning. Not all of them were right. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to improve in any subject or area of interest.
I took the course "Learning How to Learn" and it was the most vivid and productive time I spent with the wonderful speakers of the course Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. It's very informative and interesting course, I recommend it to everyone!
This course was great. The techniques and methods outlined to enable success in learning are well presented and the presenters and content are easily digested.There are a lot of optional resources worth looking as well.Very much enjoyed the course
This is how online courses should be done. I wish I had found this course earlier. It is creative, intriguing and perfectly explained. This is going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Thank you, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrance Sejnowski.
I so wish I did this course before starting college and not after finish it, my college life would have been so much easier. They don't teach us these skills in school or college, unfortunately. Thank you Barbara and Terrence for this great input.
The content and techniques are very practical, which really made me think of my old ways of ineffective learning.I will try to apply them for my learning journey. The lessons were very enjoyable as well. Thank you to both teachers, Barb and Ted :D
Brilliant course. I've been watching many videos about self-improvement and how to learn faster, but this was one of the most complete and didactic material I've come across. It gives helpful insights to the way we process new subjects and skills.
After many fraustrations throught my academic career I have final found the lessons which I wish had been taught! All kids in secondary schools should be taught these lessons (and probably repeated every year) before they are taught anything else.
This course is full of good ideas, methods, tips, guides, stories of others experiences - from what to enhance ones learning skills and knowledge. Glad I took it, as it helped me widen my thinking and understanding about the topic. Thank You guys!
I have always struggled to learn in school and now as an adult I feel a renewed sense of vitality in knowing that it was only a matter of knowing the effective ways to learn! I am re-considering going to graduate school now because of this course!
Must have for everyone! You are what you think you are and this course helps you expand into horizons which you never thought were possible. After all, learning how to learn is foundation to know everything around us and a lot more!Thank you, Bose
This course changes how I learn. I love how Dr.Oakley presented the materials. There are many new perspective that been introduced to this course. I learned new tricks to learn about new things. I applied the tips on memory and it works! Thank you

It's an amazing course. Learning scientific ways to learn will definitely benefit me throughout my life. Thank you so much for making it available on Coursera. Now, I feel more confident and I believe that bulky material will not scare me anymore.
A very interesting and well-prepared course. I am sure it will be very useful for me in the future (in fact - it is very useful already, as I started using some of the technics already while learning a foreign language). Really worth recommending!
I have learned a lot from this course. This course is well structured and it is able to streamline our mind to focus on the learning process instead of the learning result. More importantly, I have learned many techniques to learn efficiently. :)
This is an exceptional course.  I wish I knew about it  before.  My previous  job role allowed me to facilitate on several courses and I am little impressed by many presenters.  However, the presenters and the material was beyond my expectations.
I found this course very helpful, full of useful simple and easy to follow techniques. Very brilliantly and in an extra ordinary excellent way, both Terrence
Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley taught. I am personally very thankful to them. Thank you :)

I was indeed very satisfied to have completed this course. Initially, I did not know that our brain has so many things within it. It was a very nice experience in knowing the working of the brain and training it to effectively learn new concepts!
This gives great insight to, not only the process of learning, but also ideas and tips to improve your learning ability. I would recommend this course to anyone in formal education or just wanting to pickup new skills. It is a fantastic resource.
Really helpful course for learning new things. I've been generally interested in learning for a while (working with the Anki app daily to memorize things) but much of the information in this course was new to me and some has been helpful already.
It is so interesting the new discovers about our brain and the way we learn.  All the techniques are great and very useful. The videos are so interesting and clear. These tools are very useful in any area we want to learn about.  Congratulations!
This is an awesome course! I have learnt many things that help me learning more effectively and master tough subjects. Special thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, University of California, San Diego and coursera for this course.

Thank you so much! I appreciated the format for this course. The interviews were excellent. I am a middle- school math interventionist and will use many of the techniques from this course as I teach students that need strategies to be successful!
It was absolutely amazing. I should have taken it long before. I am so glad I took this course and I urge everyone to take this  course. This has changed my life a lot. And the instructors are so great especially Dr. Barbara Oakley, I loved her.
Thank you very much for making this course fun and engaging! Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski, thank you for the metaphors, frequent testing and bite-sized material chunks to help us learn. I appreciated the humour you brought in too - cheers!
My opinion is that this course is highly professional and one which college students and campus students must definitely try. I recommend this to students who find learning difficult and get stuck. this provides insight on learning how to learn.
I wish I would have taken this course when I started college, when I started my master's program, and when I started learning programming. Incredible course full of useful information and it's one of the first and only MOOCs I've ever completed.
Extremely helpful, interesting and engaging! Barb uses fun analogies that stick and Prof. Terry backs them up with scientific facts and explains concepts extremely well. I always look forward to watching the lectures and learning about learning!
Well, this course has shaped and helped me in such different ways. My thoughts and interests have been expanded and boarded. I have comprehend many ideas and understand them well. Thank you Dr Barbra and Dr Terrence for the insightful materials.
Loved it, thanks, but the work for me has just begun:  will have to work hard to find those techniques which are for me and my interests as well as incorporate so much other knowledge into my every day studies.  Muchisimas Gracias y hasta luego.
Very helpful. Deceptively easy, but it's actually quite useful and applicable to real life. As an undergrad of UCSD, I wish I had known about this course at orientation but now I'm an alumni lol. Still feels good to learn about learning, though.
This is a very valuable and interesting course. Being an educator I already had a solid background in theories of learning, but I still learned new information about how people learn. The videos were engaging and easy to follow. I would recommen
This course is really useful. Actually, it opens a new door to a new world for you.Dive into it, learn it, practice it and most important, use it. It will make your life and world different.Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
I am the person you would least likely find taking these courses. However, I really enjoy the teachers and the materials are found to be astonishingly helpful for everyone. I wish more people would enroll in this to upgrade and grow themselves.
It's an amazing course, it gives you tips so you can self-construct a learning method that works for you, and give you important cues in what might help you to be a better student, regardless of your age or area of study, is just simply amazing

I believe everyone that is not familiar with the ideas in this course should take this. It is helpful for everything you do in life basically. It provides very practical tips and tricks while at the same time explaining the science behind them.
I had the possibilities to understand how our brain works while learning, absorbing, and handling information as well as knowledge of the matter. I am thankful to how the ability of chunking makes my learning skill easier and faster and before.
Really enjoyed the course that brought various ways of stopping procracinating and studying the right way. Lessons had great explanations and the teachers switch among lessons so you dont get bored by watching only one teacher the whole course.
Worth every penny. All kidding aside, I found this refreshing, learned quite a few new techniques, and now have some ideas to discuss with colleagues at work. It is never too late to learn how to learn. -Professor of Internal Medicine, age >50.
Very interesting and useful in order to get more efficient in learning.It was a pleasure to listen to Barbara and Terry, the way they give access to people like me (non professional at all in science) so much knowledge with facility.Thank You !
For a newbie coursera student, "Learning How to Learn" is a great experience to start; course's itself is a key feature for the coursera; showing how to study for the other courses within the coursera, and for the life-long journey of learning.
I enjoyedd it and I had a chance to gain some new knowledge as I myself am an educator. It is an example of putting the knowledge into practice. Costruction of the course makes it easy to remember new things and frequently review the knowledge.
Loved this course. I have started reading everything about learning and I have seen many many information out there that is covered here in depth. Now, I am much more confident with many capacity to learn and master new subjects.Thanks a lot!!!
This is a great course with so many useful information about how our brain works, so many helpful tips about learning and life-saving strategies about testing and exams! I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in continuous learning.
A very interesting course about learning how to learn. I have read alot about this topic and this course includes everything important and is based on scientific knowledge. I would recommend it to everybody who wants to become a better learner.
I simply love it. I love Barbara, one of the best teachers I've ever seen and I love this course. After going through this course I felt that I found a lost part of me from the time when I started to learn consciously. Thank you for doing this!
Amazing course and super helpful studying tips! I will for sure apply everything I learned in real life situations. The professors and great too! (and Barbara has the most calming voice ever, which makes the course even more pleasant to watch)
It is very nice course which gave me good insights on learning techniques. As highlighted in many of the videos, my next task will be to transfer these learning techniques to coming generations.A BIG THANK YOU for outlining such a nice course.
I learned a lot about how brain works and how to avoid procrastination and whole lot of new things. I have used some of the techniques discussed in the course in my daily life and experienced the changes. Kudos to the instructors.Thanks a lot.
Learnt a lot of good methods to improve my learning and in a very straightforward, easy to understand way. I loved the revision on each week and the fact different elements were repeated throughout the course making it much easier to remember.
Great course, very important for all of us to gain understanding about our mind and how to overcome successfully procrastination. We should all take this course. It is a petty I didn't learn these tools at the beginning of my bachelor and MBA.
I took this course prior to beginning my undergraduate degree and found it immensely helpful to study smart not hard. I have found some of the principles applicable in the workforce, for personal areas of interest. I can't recommend it enough.
I loved learning through this course! I feel equipped to go ahead and learn anything I want or need.Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for providing us with these amazing tools! I look forward to joining you for your follow-through course.
Really enriching and interesting. Lots of techniques that you may be using yet when learning are scientifically explained and you may discover new ones. I'm excited to use what I have learned in this course when learning new things. Thank you!
This is an excellent course! Great content and explanations related to our brain and how it works (make sure to also read the optional reading material), very good and easy to use techniques and practices that help boost the learning capacity.
Thoroughly enjoyed this course. Information about the structures of the brain and the easily applicable techniques for memory,study and beating procrastination were invaluable. Also the optional reading was very insightful. Thank you very much
This class is amazing, simply put. If you're looking to tackle subjects you find difficult, I recommend jumping right in. Not only is it packed with useful tips and practical how-to's, Dr. Oakley is encouraging, even when the going gets tough.
Excellent class. Well planned and executed. I wish material like this had been available when I was in high school decades ago. However, I still plan on learning new stuff before I die, so the skills learned in this class will definitely help.
presented really well.  great insight into learning and jam packed with ideas to tackle procrastination.  enjoyed learning about the importance of exercise to learning.  barbara does a great job as well as sejnowski.  take this course.  enjoy!
Learning how to learn is a really great and fun course that gives you and insight on how your brain works and how you could use several aspects on your favor whenever you are learning new things or taking tests on a sport, on your carrer, etc.
This MOOC is the most useful one I've taken. These learning skills are so valuable for anything I will be doing. This course, combined with the Mindshift MOOC I just completed should be incorporated into the earliest level of higher education.
Excellent, it provides awesome tools and strong foundations in order to get the most when learning, and indeed it's funny to experience how some of the concepts are included in this course and content is so well 'sticked' in the brain. A must!
Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team.......Thank you for a wonderful course, that helped me learn about the working of the fascinating "brain"! I hope to apply some of these techniques to learn difficult things.
The skill of being able to effectively learning is maybe the most valuable skill for a majority, if not all, of people. This course is the best way to learn that skill that I have ever seen which makes me strongly recommengint it to everyone.
Very useful, practical and easy to apply methods of effective learning, especially, for the more challenging subjects like math, science, engineering etc....It helps make learning fun again! I wish if I had taken such a course before college.
This course is a blessing. I really express my gratitude to Dr. Barbabra Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and all the others for cumulating all the resources , designing it to perfection and coming up with this course. Thank you, once again.
This course was a breath of fresh air. It made me realize that I was not being very efficient in the way I was learning new subjects. It taught me techniques and how to apply them  to become a better learner. Would totally recommend to anyone
Amazing course. It has really helped me understand what it is to actually learn. The concept about 'illusion of competence' really shook me and made me think about what I actually know and how do I go from here to become better. Thanks a lot!
Huge thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!All of the material was extremely helpful not only from the theoretical but from the practical point of view.Learned a long and really enjoyed the process of learning about learning
Excellent Course for really Learning how to Learn. A course like this should be included in the curriculam of every education system. Thanks Coursera for putting forth this module with such brilliant concepts explained in a simplified manner.
This course was really great and taught me a lot of things how to think to solve problems. I loved every technique of you guys, I'm really excited to try these techniques on my daily routine, already started tho and I can tell the difference.
A very interesting look at the common problems you face when you start learning something new.It's quite easy to grasp the concepts, and also I found it awesome how well they explain the common pitfalls we find when we are studying something.
Quick Mooc. Interesting concept to learn. Quizz adapted to the lesson and in accordance to what the mooc explain about learning. Lots of ressource links. I recommand to read in parallel "A mind for numbers", which will make you learn better !
The title of the course is self-explanatory. The techniques involved are simple and easy to adopt. I would highly recommend that everybody take this course, whether you're an academic or just somebody who is interested in learning new things.
It is an excellent course that really teaches learning in a very holistic manner. It is beyond effective in its dedications to constantly engage, drill and deliver learnings to the learners. Overall, a brilliant course that I am grateful for!
Thanks for sharing these usefull tips. I encourage people to do this MOOC due to the fact, that wether in school or university, you do not learn how to learn effectively. This Course should be taught in every educational institution at first.
Excellent course for those who doubt their learning abilities and need some new habits to help them retain information. Also great for those with good habits who want to learn some new techniques for learning more efficiently and effectively.
You can refresh yourself and feel young again by learning like you're in 20s again. The methods that I learned in this course was not surprise to me, but how they organized and complement each other for powerful understanding is the surprise.
Fantastic course I would recommend to everyone! Not only do you learn how your brain works regarding the learning process, but it also helps you boost your self-confidence and try things you always wanted to but thought they were not for you.
A lot of new and unexpected knowledge is the main con of this course. Personal experience of a lecturer has been very helpful and inspiring to me as I'm also starting to study Mathematics for which I've never had a talent before as I thought.
Very good course with excellent material to develop your learning skills. The course has been written in a way in a way that incorporates many of the concepts. I would recommend the course to anyone wishing to improve their ability to learn.
I was thinking that this course was ordinary self-improvement content but it was not. The material is based on scientific facts. The instructors are very competent. I will use the knowledge that I learned from this course for my entire life.
Really helped me find the key to learning properly after a decade of struggling. Ms. Oakley and Mr. Sejnowski are very good instructors. Their no-pressure style made me perform beyond my own expectations. I hope more people take this course.
I loved this course. It wasn't only educational but entertaining and had a very good balance. Videos are short and easy to remember and keep you engaged. Thank you for an excellent course. I just wish my university courses were as good. Paul
Excelent course, i needed some support to improve my learning techniques and i am happy to say that this course was really helpful, thank you so much i'll try to practice al the techniques and concepts i learned here, 10/10 for the course!!!
It's an excellent course! Wonderful and well explained, with multiple references, techniques and tools, which will undoubtedly be very useful to me.
I thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejwonsky for teaching me how to learn effectively.
I love Barbara's voice and her teaching style!I learn to discover myself and how to unlock my potential and the value of perseverance.Many thanks both lecturers! you are so kind and listen to us :)I wish that one day I can see you in person.
Brilliant course. Brilliant teachers. I would recommend this course for students at any level or anyone else for that matter. The material provides you with techniques that you can use not only in your study but in your day-to-day life, too.
I absolutely love this course. I find myself referring back to it throughout the day. Its taught me a lot about my learning style and the different ways I can study in a more productive manner. This course is great for any level of learning.
Incredibly helpful strategies that I wish I had known when I was in high school and college. I will definitely use them as I prepare to enter a new career field that will involve learning LOTS of things I was previously afraid of (aka math).
This is a truly great course that I would recommend to anyone. What is taught in this course, what this course makes you aware of, is the single most important and essential thing that formal education could, should, but doesn't give people.
Before learning anything you must know the art of learning. This course teaches how to do that, show the path. It is you who has to go in that path. The course is excellent with so many new methods and teachings about how to manage our time.
this should be a pre-requisite for all academic / non-academic fields / passions pursued.  invaluable course and materials to better understand how the mind operates and what methods are best utilized to learn and ultimately succeed. thanks!
Very well organized course.Really helpful in understanding how to learn. It helps to understand how our brain functions and shows advanced techniques how to use our potential. The lecturers are likable and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed it.
I wish I had taken this course 25 years ago. That said, this comes at a good time -- I'm pivoting my career. It really feels like applying these lessons could get me from an okay trajectory onto a great trajectory. This is the missing piece!
Normally, I get bored so easly; however, in this course I didn't get bored and I learn so many things that will help me in studying for my lessons. The shorter lesson, the more success. Thank you for that you provide this opportunity for us.
A great, light, and fun course on learning. It was really easy to take in casually, and the optional video interviews were surprisingly insightful. I also looked over the optional reading links and many of them were extremely fun and useful.
This is a course that should be taught in all educational institutions in all levels! Fantastic instructors, and great content. This class has helped me immensely with other courses and on the job too! Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!
Fantastic course for an undergraduate like me. Not only for this undergraduate but also for the one's who like to enhance their learning ability better than before in any field. The age is not the constrain to understand the course material.
Perfect, really interesting. I think this course is changing my way of studying and thinking. Very motivating. Moreover I don't have a very good level of English, but even without Italian subtitles, all the videos were very clear. Thank you!
Great tips. Well paced videos that were easy to get through or make time to listen to. Mini quizzes along the way to test that the information was being recieved.Well planned, excellent and very helpful. Thank you for the Pomodoro technique!
I just wanted to first thank you to the creators of this powerful course which literally has shaped my learning. Thank you once again. I'm looking forward to more from you such courses which could help us shape our learning methods further.
Just the course I needed. I always felt my learning process is wrong and my base is shaky. But this course helped me get a new scientific learning process that is working great for me. Also I've more confidence in the solving the questions.
I loved this course, it helped me to avoid procrastination, I learned interesting techniques to improve my learning and also thanks to this course I now appreciate more some things I didn't in the past. This course made me a better learner.
This course helped me to gain back my intrinsic motivation. I learned so much in it and it improved a lot aspects of my life. A big Thank you to the amazing professors. It was by far the most helpful and enriching courses I´ve taken so far.
Absolutely fantastic. Plenty of highly useful and directly applicable information in how to improve learning. Handy techniques based on solid research. An absolute game changer. I will benefit all my life from what I learned in this course.
I love this course 🤩👍🏻. This is awesome to learning how to learn. I generally took a lots of life changing leaning lessons from that course. I'm really thankful to complete this course with fine grades. 💖 Lots of love to Barbara Oakley.
This is definitely a worthwhile course even if you think that you are busy, and you do not have time. Personally, this course has completely changed how I view studying. It will definitely be the most helpful online course that I ever took.
I really enjoyed this course and it's heightened my interest in how to optimize my learning.  I pretty much use the Pomodoro technique on a daily basis since taking this course.  I'm planning to take the follow-on course in the near future.
It really changed the way of my thinking and I start thinking beyond my abilities. Really helpful course. Instructors here are so helpful and those interviews with experts in every week inspired me alot.Take this course and happy learning!!
I was realy surprised of some new tricks to help shift my thinking and tackle procrastination. I'm on track to fight this problem adn i see good way for doing it. Nad after taking tests - it looks lika i'm able to learn. Thank youvery much!
I got a new view on how to learn and this helped me quite a lot. Maybe not in college because I think that what I'm learning is useless in the long run. On the other hand, learning sales, electronics, history has become much more enjoyable.
The perfect course to complete first.  Metalearning definitely helped me not just learn faster, but better understand myself.For me, the sections on procrastination and on how to create chunks helped me the most.  I used to cram a lot more.
Very Useful course that helped me to learn effective ways of learning. I wish i went through this course during my school days itself. Big thanks to Dr Barbara and Dr Terrence and the Coursera team for offering this wonderful course / MOOC.
This was a great course that introduced new techniques about learning and allowed me to improve my approach to learning new material. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to retain and apply what they learn in their everyday lives.
It was my first course on coursera and I believe that I couldn't start better. The authors of the course made an astonishing job. Despite working 8hrs of work every day,  I enjoyed a lot attending the next lessons of this course. Thank you.
Only a few lectures in and I love it! Very practical advice on how to learn better! Something you can use for the rest of your life. I also really like the lecturers - they add in fun jokes and analogies to make the course more interesting.
I feel like i just learned how to drive my brains, through data management. Now I have licence to learn efficiently. It comes down to practice and make it my way of learning. 

Thank you for sharing this valuable information with all of us.
You need some basics about biology and psychology (basic of basics) but finally this course is perfect introduction to prepare yourself to learning. People who has basics about learning, or think they have, could systematize they knowledge.
Best course ever (And  have taken a lot). It has improved my performance and learning and productive capacity. Thanks to Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski, You have become my favorite teachers. I owe you a lot. This course has changed my life
This is a great introduction to the brain and how we take in information--and put it together. Very clear and accessible but never boring. Highly recommended to anyone who's trying to understand how to more effectively to learn--and create.
IMO this is an awesome course. I probably only remember 10% of the things I would like to remember, but that will make me a much better student than I was before. Special thanks to the 2 Instructors and to everyone involved in this course!
Obsessed! These learnings are appliable to everything and anything and will only bring progression in one's life if applying. I appreciate the awesome learnings, growth and especially free class. Thanks for making learning super fun again.
Very interesting, and more importantly, helpful course that shows you how to learn and really internalise new things. It also provides insights into how your brain works and how to tackle procrastination. Recommended not only for students.
The topics presented would be very helpful for learners of any age and at any stage of their life.  Further, the way the lessons were presented was very easy to follow and helped me better understand the concepts they were trying to relay.
Awesome! It was super useful for me. I realized things about my own head I could not imagine. And reevaluated my memory, that turned out to be pretty good. Everything works better, when you “read the instructions”. I recommend this course!
I really learned a lot in this course. Thanks to Dr. Barbara OakleyIn fact, I strongly suggest this course to be included in the school curriculum. From the start the student will know how to study effectively. The results will be awesome.
This course really helped me remember what I've known before and gave me a lot of insights at the same time. I'm definitely a different person now with a better understanding of how my brain works. Thank you a LOT for your tremendous work.
Every learner and teacher will benefit from this course. The presentation is clear and fun, and you feel as if it is a real classroom setting. All concepts are backed by science, but the explanation is very simple for anyone to understand.
Love the material and the way the whole course was build. What is profondly helpful is how the neuroscience that is used and put foward as to why such ways of learning are more efficient. Thank you to the whole team for making this course.
I wish i knew about this course when i was in university , or even before that, when i was in school. A mandatory course for all teachers, learners, and new starters !! thank you Coursera and Dr. Barbara Oakley, and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
I enjoyed taking this course I got a lot out of it and will use a lot of the techniques in future tests and other challenges to come and will teach it to my child when the time comes for him to endeavor in stressful test taking situations.
This course is definitely a must for all those involved in education. As an eternal student, I find it incredibly useful to anyone who wishes to have a better understanding of how our brains work and how we can make learning more effective
There is so much good material here.  This is a course I went through carefully and thoroughly.  I enjoyed watching the videos multiple times and reading the transcripts.  The optional readings and interviews are well worth it.  Excellent!
This course was very easy to follow and provided me with some effective tools which has already helped me with my everyday tasks in my job.  Dr. Oakleys passion for learning made the different learning topics very interesting and humorous.
It's a pretty neat course, definitely couples well with the current book I'm reading, "How We Learn". I really enjoyed how each section wasn't filled with too much content to complete in one week, they know how to space out their material.
I wish someone explained learning to me in this kind of way, when I was in high school or even before. But it's never to late to learn! It has changed the way I learn and I have learned how to overcome procrastination. Deeply recommend it.
THIS IS A FANTASTIC COURSE!!! 
I can't believe the secrets these persons gave here, are so simple and unknown.THANK YOU REALLY! You have changed me, and I am sure you changed the other persons who studied here.Greetings, and God bless you!
I saw this course in Open Source Science University in GitHub and decided that I would take it. I am just in the introductory part yet but it already taught me a lot of things. I will change my evaluation later once I complete this course!
Simple and effective.A quick introduction to the biology of the human brain, and how to leverage it to your advantage when confronted with difficult subjects, or high-stress examinations.Recommended for all students, studying at any level.
I made a few valuable connections between some of the things I have been doing well in the past in trying to learn new skills, and some things that just don't work. Now I can concentrate on the "chunking" tips that work on my next classes.
Course gives you insight on various tools which help us how to concentrate on our study & develop ourselves to learn new things. Get to know very good techniques to form good habits to concentrate on study & as well as learn new subjects.
I highly recommend this course to anyone who struggles with procrastination and wants to improve their study habits. Although the course could be a bit more concise, it offers a lot of useful study strategies in a very comprehensible way.
If you think you lost your way in your studying, you can't perform well in your learnings, this will be the course for you. You can get many motivations and studying tips from the course which will be surely be effective to your learning.
Great course. I greatly appreciate Dr. Oakley and Coursera bringing this free course to millions of people eager to learn new things. Life is a never ending journey of learning. I highly recommend this course for all ages and backgrounds.
Course full of useful tips how to master your learning.I highly advise to watch the videos and make notes, It might be useful later.Barb and Terry are very knowlegde professionals which brought a lot of interesting content to this course.
Really enjoyed learning about some of the ways we can improve learning and how at times simple things i was doing was actually a disadvantage.  A short course with a lot of good information and really enjoyed how they "chunked" the videos
This class teaches you some powerful techniques for learning more efficiently and enjoying it while doing so. It utilizes the taught methods during the course, which both helps you learn, and see how these methods can be used in practice.
This course was very clearly laid out and delivered. It includes a great balance of background concepts and relates them to real-world strategies and tools that immediately find their way into your day-to-day thought processes. Thank you!
I was familiar with some techniques and not with others. Re-affirming the know ones, like Pomodoro, with new ones like the Memory Palace fills me up with confidence to continue learning and pushing the boundaries of what I can accomplish.
Outstanding!I have a minute or so to summarize, so I will simply say that I believe what I learned in this course will provide significant value for years to come. Thanks to the instructors for an outstanding journey on learning to learn.
I learned lot of things after this course. I got confidence that anyone can learn anything. I can definitely avoid procrastination if I practice the techniques in this course. I recommend to  people who have hard time to learn new things.
Such a great course, it helps you grasp the fundamental of learning and what I love most about this course is that is shows and teaches you how your brain words, and by that they can show you the best ways to learn and the most effective.
Excellent course.  I started college in 1969 and went through undergraduate and two graduate programs without knowing this stuff.  Things would have been much easier and I may have learned more if I had known this material when I started.
Easy to understand and many useful references to other sources of information which helps to understand better and learn how to learn. Simple, organized and well-structured with everything documented by facts/researches/experimentes/etc..
Although I have trouble while taking this course (so much delay and procrastination) but I really appreciate the efforts of teachers and enjoy many techniques to my studying and working. I still have to learn and practice a lot.Thank you!
This course had a considerable positive influence on my academic situation, career and everyday life, making them develop faster and gain new skills in less time with effort.It's a good idea to have a small manual for your precious brain.
I loved the course! I started binge-watching it initially because I just loved the way Prof. Barbara Oakley described things with visual aids. The course is beautifully designed. The optional interviews with interesting people is a bonus!
Really appreciate this course. Every time I re-watch it, I learn something helpful and new. Proudly I'd say I have learnt this course at least 4 times, and recommended it to two of my best friends as a must have thing in life of learning.
This course is very enjoyable and highly stimulating. I intend to use the learning techniques as I journey into retirement. German is a language I will learn to enhance my attendance at Oktober Fest 2016. Thanks loads for the information.
Good starting point for self education, wonderful teacher and mind blowing external interviews. This MOOC helped identify bad studying habits and gave me tools to start wining battles on procrastination. Altogether a very valuable course.
Awesome courses. Very helpful. I'll ask my kids to learn it. The courses should also be taught in, at least, high school. High school kids have so many courses to master and the course can help them learn more efficiently and effectively.
i like it in the way of trying some of the advices in real life. Some of them works and that's matter. I would be pleased if the authors can make a "Learning how to learn - part 2" course or something like that. Thanks for the knowledges.
An exceptional course. I wish I had known all these techniques when I was in school. Its something all teachers and students should get their hands on to improve their efficacy and test results, and also helps to retain more information.
Incredible course! I am glad I was able to access this course, thank you so much for your kindness. The knowledge and insights I gained in this course are applicable to many area of life that requires mental processing and understanding.
Learning How to Learn has helped me understand my learning challenges and how best i can overcome them for  better learning. Having an insight on how my  brain functions too  helps me to adopt the best techniques and habits for learning.
This course changes your perspective towards learning. It unlocked abilities that I believed I did not posses in the past. What you learn from this course can be applied to every aspect of your education as well as in your personal life.
Wonderful and deep material. Told with the perfect public-speaking skill. Creatively illustrated. I would like to say lot of THANKS to honorable Professors Oakley and Sejnowsky, and to all those who are involved in this course right now.
I enjoyed this course and the items it had offered. I feel that now I have a better understanding at how to learn new things and I look forward to applying the techniques learned in real life.Thank you for providing this course for free.
I learnt many clever tips and useful methods.The Dr. Barbara Oakley is very nice, clear and expressive teacher. The Dr. Terrence Sejnowski seems too serious while is a adventurous and precise teacher!

I'm very satisfited of this course.
I really liked this course, I learned many little techniques like pomodoro method, focused and diffuse mode, how to overcome procrastination and many other. I am really greatful and happy that I found this course. Thank you very much....
I think it was very useful to explain the methods of learning and how to take advantage of the entire parts of the human mind and focus on the content and not the output and its impact on the person in increasing awareness and creativity
Excellent course to develop lifelong learning skills to keep you advancing in life.  This course gives excellent advice for not only learning but also test taking skills.  Pomodoro is a very useful and effective method to teaching focus.
Excellent course! The material was helpful, practicable and applicable. Course is structured to facilitate learning and retention and was easy to understand. I highly recommend to everyone who will ever learn another thing in their life.
Great course, and I am so glad to have taken it! I like that I can refer back to videos when necessary. The information taught has shown me a way to use a brain more effectively when learning. I actual look forward to study new material.
This was a great course to take as a teacher, and connects with many resources I use in class. I will encourage colleagues and students to take it to help their own learning (and as students to take ownership of their brains). Thank-you.
Excellent course for anyone who wants to understand the deeper concepts of learning. You will no longer need to say "I don't do well in exams" because you will learn how to learn subjects instead of simply trying to memorize information.
Learning how to learn is a life changing experience for me. Applying this principles can not only make someone learn better but also help a person become successful. Highly recommended! Coursera must honour this course with a Gold Medal.
It's a great course, that highly enriched both my brain and heart with new information. The journey through these 4 weeks was amazing and full of revelations of how your own brain works. Thank you, dear Professors for such an experience!
Very good course!! I got  a better understanding on how human brain works plus some very useful learning tips.Also, i enjoyed very much the interviews on the supplementary material of the course.I would definitely recommend this course .
Awesome course; in 4 weeks succinct course has introduced to very practical concepts for learning new complex subjects. Expert interviews of great value to see the concepts being used by folks using various methodologies in real life....
A wonderful course that teaches us essential life-hacks which promote efficiency in our basic activity namely, learning. A must course people involved in any profession that demands continuous learning and update. Cheers to the learning!
I used this course for my summer freshmen college students in Strategies for Success. Thank you. I am now using it again for this Fall group. I wanted to introduce them to the content AND to online courses. COURSERA is the best for each.
This has been a remarkable 4 weeks. I have gained more information about my brain and how it functions when studying as well as in a work environment. I would highly recommend this to varsity students as well, it’s a great mindset tool.
A course that is fun, has a very well-thought structure, teaches you by both know-how and show-how, and helps in every aspect of your life. Thank you the the amazing and inspiring lecturers Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!
Excellent course. Well organized and engaging. Super cool tips that I will be sure to carry with me for the rest of my life. Lovely instructors. Good quizzes that sum up the unit. Thank you for all of the hard work put into this course.
Awesome course! I didn't actually feel any pressure while watching the videos and attempting the quizzes. I didn't have to work on absorbing the lectures as the wonderfully designed quizzes and assignments helped me absorb the lectures.
Excellent course! It almost begins to repeat data or advice, but comes at scenarios from different perspectives, so it was always fresh! I cannot recommend this course enough for anyone who is interested in learning more efficiently. A+
Where was this course when I was a student!? I am grateful to have the opportunity to learn how to learn. Using effective techniques and learning what methods work vs don't was extremely helpful. I know I will take this with me forever.
If I have to choose only one course from Coursera, I would say I would pick this course. I regret that I should have learned this course while I studied in high school and university. I learned a lot from this course. Thank you so much!
Great course, the instructors presented it in a very simple enjoyable way.I discovered a lot of new things about how to be an efficient learner and handle tests in a successful way.Thank you for all the team of  Learning how to learn? .
Excellent presentation, study material and last but no of tests  with minimum 70 % for passing.I have learned lot from this course. I will try to implement in my life.  Also ideas can be shared to other persons so that they can improve.
A refreshing perspective on the science behind learning. The course also introduces a set of simple tools that anyone can apply in their daily lives for a positive change. Some of the optional assignments and videos are interesting too.
Well Structured and well paced course with Summary at the end of each week and testing by module and again testing in the end.  This is very useful to all learners given that learning is a life long activity in everyone's life.  Thanks.
This is great course which teaches skill useful in every walk of life . The teachers make the techniques very clear and help you to develop the interest further . I am thankful to the teachers and all those who made this course possible

The course was very informational. I have a biological science background and took a neuroscience class when I was in college. This class integrated many scientific knowledge and presented various ways to help people learn how to learn.
Learning How to Learn is a fantastic course as it delves into underlying principles that helps us to understand.  I highly recommend this course to anyone that wants to unlearn bad learning habits or wants to learn good learning habits.
A good course, I always know some of these idea in the course, but not systematically, so I tend to ignore them. Now I know that how to learn and those idea works. I am sure this course shall help me out of the mud and haze of thinking.
The course

to my understanding of the process of learning. Great job, thank you!

I got a lot out of this course. I am now paying particular attention to using the focused and diffuse modes of thinking, and spaced repetition in my learning - and the pomodoro technique for everything from academia to housework!
This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the coursera learning experience and is relevant to any other learning endeavors you might have in all aspects of life. I recommend taking it before any other courses on the sight.
I learned a a lot about effective learning and maximizing the potential. I think I should have taken this course before I started my high school in 2001. I recommend to every individual to take this course without any hesitation.
While most of this information can easily be found elsewhere, it's a great refresher course if you have learned this stuff, and a well organized introduction if you haven't. The thing that puts it over the edge is the Interviews.
The course exceeded my expectations.My main reason for doing the course was to give me ideas as to how to learn a new language (my third) after the age of 60 and in a new country and environment. Needless to say, I am encouraged!
Content and delivery of the course is very crisp and clear. Its added with scientific facts which make it very powerful. Excellent pace and chronology to take us thru the steps of learning process. Thank you Barbara and Dr Steve

Really excellent course. I knew some of the learning techniques but not how they were connected with neuroscience and brain function. Would recommend this course to students and lifelong learners like myself. Thanks for sharing.
Really helped solidify and reinforce the methods of learning and retention in a purposeful and meaningful way. As an adult learner, I really enjoyed learning the new tools and incorporating them, it has really helped. Great job!

It was a very useful course! I am very glad that I learned this information in my 30 years. I still have time to improve my knowledge in different areas! I recommend to anyone who believes that he is not able to learn something.
Very Useful. Things that i used do while in school and college are so useful that i can apply even now.  Modes of thinking, chunks and procrastination. Barbara  and Terrence are fantastic in explaining concepts in simple format.
Great tips for young students and older professional alike! Most ideas might seem common sense, but few actually put them to practice with a conscious mind. It provided a lot of "professional" advice for my kids also. THANK YOU!
Excellent contents, objective and very useful for people who are interested in knowing more about the learning process and how the brain works. The videos are well prepared, dynamic and the teachers make the topic easy to learn.
Useful course. Wish they would touch on Essay writing and how to tackle mental blocks or how to get started. They focused a lot on test taking, but in Masters level a lot is based on essays. Overall good course and entertaining.
Great and informative course. Wonderfully tailored to an online environment. Well worth a look whether you're in high school, university, or simply want to make more effective use of your time when learning new topics or skills.
It's a practical and helpful course. It's helping me improve my learning skills and strengthen my self confidence in what I'm learning. One more benefit from the  course is that I'm going to reach more areas beyond reach before.
This is a fantastic course that I wish I would have had available to me when I was still in high school. I think the concepts taught would have put me on an entirely different educational path. Thanks again for the great course!

i love very much this course. i enjoyed every subject and also i think my mind opened now. i want to share my experience in learning how to learn with my friend and family to know this is an important thing that they must know.
A must course for students and a helpful course for adults as well :) I really wish I have taken this course back when I was a student, but I'm looking forward to use my new knowledge in learning different things in the future!
Really great advice for learning! Initially assumed this course to be heavily academics based, but really it covers learning across all aspects of life and encourages self-reflection on current habits and potential wrongdoings.
Excelent, I got a learned through life and instincts a lot of what is teached here, and learned a lot more! There is a lot to pick up, even if not everything convinces you there is still a lot you can learn to improve yourself.
This is the best course ever. Not only has it helped me improve my learning, but my students. I have three undergrads and since I began teaching them the methods shown in this course their performance has improved dramatically.
Learning the information was both fun and insightful. It allowed me to approach the concept of lifelong learning in a new way and has especially assisted me to take a new approach in planning academic programmes for my students
This course is a beautiful and simply put way to describe how anyone can improve the way they study and learn material, and it also provides a way to counteract procrastination and anxiety, two common problems of most students.
This course really helped me to think more clearly and it do not only teaches how to learn, it teaches also how to not procrastinate, how to do thinks, how to plan yourself and the course is full with rich interviews.I love it!
I really enjoyed this course.  The content and presenters were interesting, well paced and easy to understand.  I found the information to be very interesting and I know I will remember a lot of the information and it will help
I found Learning How to Learn an enjoyable class class. I paired my efforts by reading the book alongside taking the class and gained knowledge about the topic which I am using in my efforts to learn faster and more deeply now.
I have acquired many useful techniques about learning and been aware that I used to be over learning which is inefficient. In the future,  I will try to apply what I have learned intros course to improve my learning efficiency.
It was really interesting, I learned a lot not only about what to do to learn better, but why these techniques will work, and why it is important to understand how your brain works so that you can make the best of you learning.
Really good material on how to learn more effectively. The lectures are well planned and there is plenty of additional material to help students go after more in depth knowledge. Congratulations on putting together this course.
This is a very valuable course that provides a wealth of "hands-on" tools that we can use in our daily lives to improve our level of learning and understanding of whatever material you are trying to learn, thank you very much!
Learning how to learn provides pragmatic tips and data-backed recommendations that helped me adjust to real life problem solving scenarios and be better prepared for challenges that involve acquiring new knowledge and testing.
The course was well designed. I benefitted hugely from it. Barbara and Terry thanks a lot. I have passed the age of formal education. Such courses enable me to keep up with new content. Hope to do more and expand my knowledge.
.......as I thought and expected, this course was fundamental and a must take course, to prepare me for the track I want to embark on. An essential course for anybody, to grasp the knowledge on how to learn.....in any subject.
Very straight forward and helpful information. To me, the pace of the course seemed slow at first, but I think that helped to add emphasis on the importance of understanding what happens in our brains that enables us to learn.
This course has been an eye opening experience for me, I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with learning anything ,the course teachers are immensely helpful and explain the concepts in a beautifully simple manner.
The course provided some very powerful ideas on how to become a more effective learner. If would be the best if this course is taken together with another that gives more in-depth review of the neuro processes behind learning.
Fantastic MOOC, helped me alot on recovering my focus and "zombies".The most helpful tool I'm using is the pomodoro technique described in the course.The daily task list is also a very useful way of setting objectives everyday
Very useful, interesting, and helpful.  It really helped me understand how come I memorized some stuff easier than others.  I've learned so much on how to learn and I've been applying it for other courses.  Highly recommended.
Thanks !This is my first finished Coursera course. It's really nice of you to providing this online course. I think someday in the future, when I have some ripe course idea, I will do the same thing. Keep learning.

Fantastic course. Having been plagued by procrastination for most of my life, this course taught me some useful and easy techniques to overcome this obstacle and make my life easier and learning much more enjoyable. Thank you.

This course really helped me to understand different ways to improve my learning and thinking abilities. I would recommend others to follow this course since it makes you learn about the things which we think we already know.
I like the way material is presented.  As mention in the course,  our education system more bother about result of learning. But first time, I learned the process of learning itself. Very useful when I study any new material.
This course is amazing. I found out why I have failed so much in my studies so far. This course should be taken in all elementary schools. That way everyone would understand the importance of studying and how to really study.
Brilliant course reveals a lot of useful tips and practices. It showed me how important is to use both modes of the brain to be a better learner. Also I learned how procrastination tricks you and how to cope with it. Love it.
I learned so much from this course, it was also a glimpse at university, thank you so much.  Since completing this course I have started my journey to enrolling with the University of New England, Australia.  Thank you again.
It is awesome! I learned how to learn in less than two months and Professors are so good at explaining I had no problem even if I'm not a native english speaker. If you are a curious mind that course is for you, go and learn!
I have understood about my study style, which I think will help me a lot in pursuing new learning. Many thanks professor Barbara Oakley and her co-ordinator for preparing this course and made it available to such many people!
You should definitely do this course if you are: i. A disciplined, self-motivated lifelong learner ii. Curious about how you learn and looking to hack the best way to learn iii. An aspiring autodidact or an aspiring polymath.
This course makes tackling a new subject methodic and easy, even addressing public enemy #1 -  procrastination (I bet you thought I was going to say Donald Trump). It becomes so much harder to get thrown off track. Thank you!
I've learnt very useful tools which I'm going to start applying very soon. Very interesting to know a little bit about how our great brain works. Teachers know how to transmit the ideas in a concise but effective way. Thanks!
Most exciting course that I encountered through 3 yrs being active on coursera. Big thanks to everybody involved and keep it up! You help people change their lives and achieve their dreams. And sophistication is contagious :)
Fantastic course. There were complex concepts delivered in simple (but not patronising) language, and some practical steps to take during your continued learning.Thank you very much for an entertaining and informative course.
The quiz questions were laced with humour and made it easier to recall the techniques. Lot of new facts and information were shared in the course and I believe it will really help me address one huge problem: procrastination.
Great course to help one be aware how they learn and become a more effective learner.  Recommended to my 14 years old son to take.  It will make his high school years so much more easier and he will be a pro at it by college!
This is a great course for all people who learn especially students. There are many techniques taught to focus as well as for intuitive thinking methods. The lecturers are wonderful. Ms. Barbara Oakley keeps you on your toes.
Learning how to learn is a very practical course and, despite of that, it is extremely based on scientific knowledge. This combination results in a valuable tool for everyone who is interested in improve its learning process.
This course is really amazing and helpful for everybody (no doubt - specially for me). Now, I know why I were a procrastinator and how to manage it with ease. Thanks to all involved with the development of such a good course.
For someone who has struggled with tests all her academic career, this course was extremely helpful! I learned so much about my brain and effective techniques to retain important concepts and work through complex situations.

This is my first Coursera course that I have taken and I have to say that it was very professional. Definitely will learn some more new things on this platform as I find it very helpful in growing and developing your skills.
It was eye-opening to read about the reasons why one procrastinates and how to overcome this habit. This was a wonderful course and I enjoyed it. I believe it will help me with studying more effectively in my future courses.

LOVED this course! I enjoyed learning about the brain and how it functions. The tips on overcoming procrastination were VERY helpful and I'll be using the Pomodoro technique from now on. Thank you so much for a great course!
Learning how to learn in a smart and effective way is a must in the coming age of AI / robotics. Those who don´t have this skill will have a tough time in the not so far future. In this regard, this course is really helpful!
The course was very helpful. It gave me a deeper understanding of my brain and how to use to more efficiently. Also, it gave me many studying tips that are very helpful.

Many thanks to Barb & Terry. Many thanks to Coursera.
I cannot find the words to say thank you in a proper manner. It is a wonderful experience to be part on it. It changes all my points of view about learning, open my mind and, I hope, be a better learner in life. Best Wishes.
Awesome course.  Doing Pomodoros has completely changed how I approach focus activity, but I never would have tried the technique without the context provided by this course.  And that's just one example! Highly recommended.
Very good course!. Easy, useful, well structured and mild. Thank you very much.  Only one suggestion: I found the exercises and tests extremely useful to reinforce the learning but some times there were unnecesarily  tricky.
This course was insightful and helped me think of learning in a different way. While I knew of many of these techniques before it made me understand the psychological aspect of it which made me understand the bigger picture.
I have a PhD , and yet this course improved my learning skills, and made me aware of unproductive approaches to avoid.  I know much more about how to deal with procrastination, and how to help study groups be more effective.
I've been using this kind of techniques for learning for a while now and have to say I was a lost soul wondering a sea of knowledge before learning how to swim. After going through this course, I at least can start paddling.
The concepts of learning were made easy to understand. The problems involved with learning were explained and the solutions to the problems actually work. The modules were engaging and not too long, not to short- just right!
Excellent videos and excellent explanations of the professors. However I was very disappointed by the cost of the certificate and the fact that it could not be acquired as free, proving that I actually have passed the course
This was a fantastic course. Thanks for going so deep. I love how you discuss it from the neurological and psychological angle. I feel this will provide me with the skills I need to consume other courses as well.  THANK YOU!
Exceptional course! I'm feeling lucky to discover this course, even i'm turning to 26 years old. But late seems better than never. Thank you so much to our 2 adorable profs for sharing their experiences. Highly recommend it!
This facinating class has already improved how much I retain from other classes I'm taking. I now better understand my ability to remember things, and I am thrilled with the results of using the mental tools that it teaches.
Would definitely recommend this MOOC to anyone. As the title says, taking this course would help you in developing the "mental tools to help you" in your life long journey of learning. As a wise man once said, "Just Do It".
It was an interesting course, it should be learn by everyone especially those who have difficulty in learning or having less motivation on learning. It gives me new ideas and tips on how to learn effectively and efficiently
A great course. I wasn't expecting soo much of the course to relate to how I learn and different ways I can improve. There are a lot of suggestions made in this course that I am going to carry on implementing when learning.
Awesome and very informative class. Made me realize I was studying wrong all through my high school and college years. I highly recommend this course to anyone especially students or adults considering going back to school.
It is an amazing course. Seriously, I got much benefit of it. In addition, the teachers worked hard to give us this knowledge. I do appreciate your efforts and I'll recommend it to my friends. Much love & God bless you. Thx

Had a great time figuring out that I really don't know anything because I've never taken the time to learn anything appropriately.  This class would have been really useful when I was in college before I received my degree.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learnt interesting techniques to better understand concepts, that can be applied to any field of study. I wish I could have taken this course earlier, during my school and college years.
This is an excellent course. Honestly speaking, it give me a different perspective to approach learning. If teachers start taking this course as a guideline, they can help their students overcome their leaning frustrations.
The course was well-paced with some fantastic and engaging content, and really helped me re-think my approach to both learning and procrastination. I couldn't recommend this highly enough, especially to university students.
The course is so great. I d suggest  Coursera promotes it to be passed by most of newbies visitors of the website as it really encourages to study new subjects; and obviously, Coursera is the easiest way to learn new skills
Professor Oakley and Professor Sejnowski are great educators that made this course intriguing and informative! I definitely learned a great deal about how the mind works and feel better prepared to tackle my learning goals.
The class covered a lot of new and very useful  information that can apply to nearly anyone trying to learn a new skill. I know I will be checking back on my notes to make  sure these concepts are applied and become habits.
This is an excellent course with clear, concise easy to understand presentations, filled with useful tips on how to improve the learning process. Highly recommend it to anybody at any stage of life, as learning never stops.

The course lists out great techniques to understand and learn things. It also gives an explanation to their techniques and claims. It is a must course for people who want to learn more effectively, compared to present day.
Barbara Oakley does a good job of presenting course material in the videos.  I find her relatable.  The course has helped me review and learn some new things about studying that I hadn't made a really aware connection to.
This course is great even for audit learning like me. Just a tip to fully benefit from this course is to also watch the optional videos on the interviews. There a plenty of gems in there, which I do apply and them helped.
This course has enabled me to study more effectively by using various new techniques such as Pomodoro and switching between diffused and focused mode. The explanations are very clear with the use of analogies and visuals.

I've always been a lover of learning, and this course condenses all of the latest research into one place.  If you are ever wanting to learn something (which we all do), you need to know the information from this course.
This course offers valuable insights into how to operate your mind effectively. Although there is much more to be discovered on this subject, the creators do a good job curating the information we've discovered thus far.

It's a helpful tool to fully understand how your mind chisel every learning that you're extracting to your memory. Mr. Terrence Sejnowski and Mrs. Barbara Oakley explained the lesson thoroughly which I fully comprehend.
This is an essential course without a doubt. I realised all my life I've been following bad learner. This course was an eye-opener and now I'm equipped with multiple learning techniques and insights for better learning.
This is the perfect course for beginners who are facing difficulties in any learning activity. While going through the course, we can easily identify our faults which are continuously biting us in our learning activity.
One to return to again and again to remind yourself of techniques. Although you should use the skills everyday from the start. Vital if you want to improve yourself; Pomodoro, Recall, Focus & Diffuse states, on and on..
It's a wonderful course with plenty of useful information and feasible and practical techniques which are suitable for most of people. However, I consider those chunks of brain's chemical substances is quite irrelevant.
Found the course very informative.  I have already shared some of the information that I learned with my students.  I have also started using some of the suggestions that were given.  I found this to be a useful course.
Great course. The professors seem passionate about what they are trying to teach, and it definitely is a course that will help you not only when learning other MOOCs, but in every day life, regardless of your situation.
Perfect course! I have read many books about human brain but found new, useful and interesting things for myself. I recommended this course to all my friends :) Simple, but very powerful course. Many thanks to creators!
It is an excellent chance to review learning process and improve our skills. The skills mentioned in video are practical. There are also many points that I had failed to pay attention when I learned but worth reviewing.
I really enjoyed this course, learned many new concept to break out of the rut that prevented me from learning and retaining new concepts. This course is thorough and anyone at any age can take this and benefit from it.
Such a valuable course.  Everyone should take this course if you are a student or not.  I guarantee that you will learn some new learning nugget that will help you become a better learner.  On to the Mindshift course :)
Excellent content, well organized. Some contents are directly derived from late research results, and are very inspiring. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the brain mechanism and learning method.
This was a amazing course, great professors with a very easy way to teach, with a lots of examples. Great material, was very helpful course. Thank you Dra Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski, I became a really fan.
This course  should be a must course for any high school and college student. Even middle school student should have customized version available for their level of understanding. Thank you Barb and Terry for your time!
The best online course I have ever taken. I feel it has immensely helped me to get back on track with my learning and it helped me to sort out long pending life admin issues! I recommend it to all my friends and student
Liked the brevity of the sessions and the enthusiasm in the instructors. Small chunks of videos helped finish the course faster and helped remember the concepts without being crammed with too much information in one go.
It was GREAT experience and a bit tough. I need to review some videos and do some optional reading, but it gave me a way to think more and try easy ways of learning something new. Thank you all for this opportunity.G.K.
Mandatory class for anyone and everyone. In college, post-grad, elementary school, life long learning, this course is open to all. The material is clearly and simply explained. Providing life changing skills and habits.
Amazing content, really good way of presenting the info. To be honest is what you already know but you don't want to follow, extra points for how easy to follow are the recommendations they give on how improve yourself.
Great course! Schools should teach this content!  I already use some of the tips of techniques presented in this course, but the insights of the professors helped me to know more how to be more effective in my studies.
I really loved the whole session,  they way Madam Interacted with us is awesome. I was deeply enjoying the course. Now,  its feels bad as if I may no longer enjoy her teachings. The session was great, i learned a lot..
All the techniques mentioned in this course are easy and helpful too in almost all the fields of learning. Presently I am learning German language and surprisingly after taking this course, finding it so easy to learn.
This course is great, taking this will change your mind, and you will learn a lot of techniques that help you not only to school or college, also for work and for living, please take this course.!! You won't regret it.

a masterpiece, for every learner this course is for you, here is a note i create documenting my journey learning how to learn using this course : https://medium.com/@hamzaerrechydy/my-discovery-in-learning-855b4420770b
Excellent Course! Highly recommended for everyone who plans to learn anything or teach any subject. The theories, methods and tips given in the course are equally applicable whether you want to learn coding or a piano.
Overall very useful for those who did not have good study habits. Learning the why behind how we learn, and demonstrating techniques to learn more effectively is exactly what some people need to become better students.
I wish I had this course when I was in school and college to help me learn better! Concepts beautifully explained with examples and visualization. Very grateful for your efforts to share your wisdom and experience.Kush
This course is incredibly helpful for ANY person of ANY age. The strategies that are taught can be applied to learning almost anything. As a teacher, I will most definitely recommend this course to students! Thank you!
Very easy to follow. Takes very less time but I intentionally spaced this course over a period of 2 weeks. Felt more like tactical procrastination. Thank you very much Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for this free course.
This course really renewed my excitement to start taking on more learning projects -- particularly to revive my Spanish Language learning.   I still love receiving the Friday "Learning How to Learn" emails and updates.
Excellent: since we go to school we are focused learning topics but nobody teaches us how to learn.This course is mind-opener and gives precious advice to improve our learning techniques and become more self-confident.
This course is quite helpful for me to figure out how should I organize my study and manage my life and work. It not only gives instruction on what an how to do, but also helps you to understand why you should do this.
Very useful course.  Feel like I'm 'back in the driving seat' to tackle poor study habits and procrastination, and to tweak a few things about how I learn for better outcomes and hopefully less frustration!  Thank-you!
This is my first MOOC and I loved it! I learned a lot form it and it inspired me to continue to learn in this new way, at least form me! Thanks Dr Barbara Oakley your tone of voice really sets up the mood for learning!
This course is incredibly good. It is helping me to learn how to learn, but also has give me a new passion for neuroscience and some related topics. The teachers are excelent. I think that I'm going to do it two times!
Excellent course, with important concepts, using the learning tools themselves, it was very interactive and interesting, the tips provided can be easily applied, the interviews with different personalities were great.
i didn't make the last essay about  teaching a friend/ family member etc. on " how to learn " on their own. I'm too lazy :) beautiful course, I never knew this people before and I'm glad I've discovered this course <3
This is a great course I did not think that I would learn some powerful mental tools when I started this course. This is a really helpful online course. Thank you so much Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
It has been a very good course that has changed my way of studying, i would better say learning. The techniques mentioned are absolute great and are fore sure to help not just for academics, but in any aspect of life.
The theme looks a little bit obvious, but it isn't. Learning effectively is possible and easier with this course great techniques. I'm a new student after taking these classes. I loved to improve the way that I study.
Such a fun course. I took this along side a very difficult programming course on this site as well. It's really helping. I've been passing my quizes and better understanding the material using the professor's methods.
Basically In school it is all about grade, we are taught to just cram information and forget,! These Technics I  got from here  certainly could help me  and my children to achieve more in learning!Thank you team LHTL.
A big thumps up for this course.. a should take course for everyone...each of the lectures are genuine and we will have a interest to learn throughout the course..I respect for your work ..see u soon in next courses..
Exceptionally good techniques that I'm baffled are not included in regular school and college teachings. The content in this course is simply invaluable to everyone, and I'm sure it has changed my life for the better.
Student comment about their anxiety and depression are quite true  I have and I almost quit my degree in pharmaceutical sciences this course is the most helpful course I've ever encountered thank you so much Dr.Barba!
This course has changed the way I study and even though you feel you go slower at the beginning, you realize you actually master what you're studying, foremost to learn the new things is way easier. Thank you so much!
This contained the best tips and advice I have ever received and actually made me believe it by taking the decision myself, This worked really well and I really apreciated it. My personal thanks to Barbara and Terence
Nicely built, the professors were both very clear, sweet and enthousiastic.This has been the fist course I completed, and I learned a lot about my own learning style until the last moment (doing the test!:()Well done!
Is a very powerful material to start learning how to learn and make new ideas to improve your daily habits, not only in learning, teachers are clear and offer different material to keep on learning and deep in topics.
Interesting. Actually most techniques and ideas are common to many people.However, we can comprehensively and practically learn them for adapting to our daily life.Knowledge is power, so we have to learn how to learn.
Great Course, I have started using methods taught in the course in order to improve my learning in all aspects of life. Thanks to the instructors, fellow students, and to the people at coursera who make this possible.
This may be the most important course you ever take.  it sets the stage for effective learning for every other course. It should be on the syllabus of every child in grade 9 as the basis for all their future learning.
This is a fantastic course. The visuals are perhaps not particularly modern, but they are unique and make the course more memorable. When I'm a teacher one day, I want all of my students to complete this course first.
I have learnt a lot from this course,It does help me in learning n memory,I have been studying BEC n korean these days ,and I really benefited from the spaced repetition. thanks & appriciate for LEARNING HOW TO LEARN.
This is a gem of a class.  It provides the foundation for all other classes.The trick, of course--like all other important lessons in life--is to properly implement the material presented given each student's context.
This course is fantastic. Learning is a life long journey so better understanding the process of learning is incredibly valuable. I have already started using some of the strategies in my further learning and working.
Amazing Course! Dr. Barbara Oakley has a wonderful sense of humour to keep the lectures engaging. One of the most interesting and practical courses I have come across on Coursera both in terms of content and delivery!
Excelllent, Superb, Just amazing. The material presented is very interesting with lot of illustrations.The series of lectures by both the instructors is outstanding. Concisely and effectively delivered.Thanks so much.
Awesome course. Learning how to learn should be part of middle and high school required curricula. I will have my boys take advantage of Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski expertise and have them take this course. Thank you.
I learned a lot about why sometimes we don´t succeed at school and what you can do to understand, learn, and remember the subjects you want to learn. I recommend this course. Also class is easy to understand and fun.
This course has really helped me think about learning and find better ways to learn. The one big take away for me from this course is the Pomodoro which I am using everyday. It's helping me actually get through work.
It was extremely awesome. I actually used these techniques in my daily life before taking this course, but never knew if it was right. This source gave me that I am right and am eager to teach these to whoever I see.
that is really a fantastic and an eye opener course for me. If you really feel difficult to work or learn but you still have urge to learn and then if things seem impossible to you! then this the best course for you.
This course help me to learn new techniques to use when I am learning something and help me to remember some that I new before. Thanks to the teachers, the envited people and all the coursera team for make this real.
The friendliness and warmth of the course instructors were encouraging, and helped me through difficult times. I will be returning to this course frequently and continue practising what I've learned from this course.
I have learned excellent tools that I have already begun to implement like the Pomodoro. I have also learned more about the brain, and what good habits to practice in order to make the most of my learning experience.
Excellent and interesting course that has allowed me to understand many processes that I did empirically during my student life and maybe not completely. Now they will serve me to support first-year college students.
Some new study techniques and explanations on how your brain and memory work. Great explanations on things you already knew- like WHY procrastination is bad, why we tend to do it, and good tips for stopping it., etc.
i think this has been a very inspirational course in terms of the range and breadth if knowledge it covers from a variety of disciplines and for a diverse group of learners ranging from students to social scientists!
Would definitely recommend this course to anyone. Course is worth a million dollars. The course was well structured. I learnt a lot about learning how to learn. Lots of useful information, techniques and discussions.
This course gave me a solid foundation to learning, with lots of useful information on why study works or not. Allowing me to better formulate my study to learn deeply about subjects, negating illusion of competence.
An excellent course for learning how to learn. What I particularly liked was the interviews which opened up a pool of inspiration for me. Moreover it gave me other teachers and perspectives for improving my learning.
The course introduced me to various ways and on how approach and not to approach problems. I believe I will be able to apply almost everything that I have learned in this course in my college career and through life.
Very interesting course that can help you identify what you are (not) doing correctly in your studying and learning in general. Lots of techniques, easy to understand, and an overall new perspective for your benefit.
What ever is the age or profession, this course is helpful for all learners.Learning about learning is an important topic, that makes learning productive.Time and effort spent for this course will be hugely rewarded.
Thank you for teaching! I regret that I came across this course only at the age of 22, nevertheless, feel excited that now I am able to apply certain tools to remember things better and do well on my further studies.
It helped me to get some mental tools and master my focusing problems with studying. I also learned many new things which as a psychologist major I didn't know until now. Thanks for teaching me learning how to learn!

This course
had allowed me the opportunity to re-visit my own way to learn, identifying
techniques I am applying and how to improve them, discovering new techniques and
processes, and risks to be avoided as well.
A valuable short course that can teach you different ways to approach learning. Teaches you new ways to think about your own learning and explains how to form strong long term memories and the best ways to do it.
Lot's of good material and learned some good ways to learn better. Recall, testing earlier and more often, and tackling hard problems first then switching to easy when stuck are just a few good methods discussed.
All the information that you gain in this course is something I would describe as "Clean" and neatly presented to Us as Students in each video and lecture. Notes and you're understanding is all that is necessary.
Fantastic CourseReally enjoyed the useful, relevant and well presented material. Barb is true to her values and I particularly respected her one interview where she defended her "Start hard - jump easy" approach.
Great information for those who do not know how to actually study and how things really work in the brain. I give my students the tip of not studying more than 30 to 40 minutes at a time and it really helps them.
Starts slow, but is worth the completion. Really great gems hidden throughout. The class is very deliberate and strategic in delivery, so be patient. Take note of the techniques and enjoy the reading suggestions!
This course helped me identify the root of some of my procrastination and how might I be able to overcome it.  I recommend it to everyone who is looking to pick up new skills or are struggling with their studies.
Simply Amazing! It should be a MUST subject in every school on the planet! Thank to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and every Guests interviewed that contribuite to this course!  Now I'm going to exercise! :)
I've joined this course just for fun, but the more I went through the more I liked, in the end, it gives you so many information about learning which you would never think of. Very helpful for learning new stuff.

Very interesting content and effective teaching. However, the quizzes are too easy so in order to really benefit from the course I think it's important to take responsibility and do retrieval practice "offline".
Excellent course. I learned a lot of techniques I could use to help improve my learning. I just purchased a couple of the books by Dr. Oakley and can begin reading them. with the hope of doing this course again.
Extraordinary! The course provides a large number of useful inputs not only in learning but also in dealing with everyday life situations. I'm sure I'll find out how useful it really is during the coming months.

Cannot wait to start working on more courses to have a second chance of applying all the superb knowledge and learning techniques I've acquired in this course (being the first chance, the course itself).
Nice course! It was really important for me to know, that my ways of learning, I used all my life, are not abnormal behavior. Also, I discovered a few new tricks, that can help me to be a better learner.
Being the first mook, wasn’t sure what to expect.  Had listen to Barbara’s book on the making of this course and found the course material really interesting and well laid out. Would certainly recommend.
"If give a man a fish, you will feed him for a day; but if you teach a man to fish you will feed him for a lifetime" This is by far the most useful and practical course that each one of us should follow.
Wonderful course, which helped me to learn some of the most important skills a learner can acquire: the knowledge how learning works, what influences it, and how to adjust it to achieve the best outcome.
Provided  some great information that can be applied to everything that you do, not just school. I appreciated the instructors making the complete connection between how brains function to how you learn.
It's good course. That help me a lot. It let me know much about how the brain work and memorize the information. But my mother language is not english. It's a little challenge for me to take this course.
The instructors communicate clearly and everything seems so simple under their explanation! Most importantly, the theories of this course are backed by scientific result, which makes them more trustable.
This was an amazing experience. Immediately I was able to utilize what I learned in every day practice. The lessons are broken down into easily consumable bits and you can follow at pretty much any pace.

This course has given me the much needed techniques, knowledge and confidence to return to learning with a fresh eye. I cannot properly set down how useful this course is. Many thanks to the Authors.
NIce course, should be mandatory at the beginning of the college studies, or maybe even earlier. There are no magic formulas to learn without efforts, but this is how learning is, hard and satisfying

One of the best course I have done so far. This course really helped me in knowing my learning problems and helped me in improving my learning abilities for many of my subjects in day to day life.
Everyone should first study this course then something else because this course guides you on how to learn things and the instructors have explained most of the principles of the learning process.
After course learning how to learn made me have a lot of knowledge very important including how brain action and 2 modes of thinking, chunking, about procrastination,... Thank for course very much
A step by step methodological way to under the process of learning. It helps to get a formal understanding of brain and its operation; this way you can be more effectively  and use it efficiently.
This course is very helpful and practical. it helps me not only in the way of learning but also my perspective of learning. Wish all of you can learn practical methods and have fun in this course!
I really enjoyed this course. It has practical information and methods that you can start applying to your study routine after every lesson. I have already recommended it to some of my classmates.
Excellent material, very well presented. I would not take any course in anything before taking this class. If you have have ever had difficulty learning a new subject, this class is the way to go.
Great course! I definitely recommend to everybody who wants to get their learning going! Also very helpful for procrastinators - you get tipps to escape that dreaded situation! ;-) Very well done!
I have found learning how to learn a very interesting course. I've learned in this course about topics that I've never heard before and I found them very useful while applying them to this course.
If you want to learn more efficiently (and thereby making it more fun imo) this course is for you. For me spaced learning, the pomodoro technique, recalling and interleaving were real eye openers.
Just the right course to unleash your hidden wings to start flying to reach new horizons. Tutors are really good with tremendous experience and research. Thanks for putting up this course. Thanks.
A well-designed, well-delivered course.  I strongly recommend it to any student who wants to improve their study skills and/or any faculty member interested in learning how to help their students.
Both instructors gave a unique perspective on learning process. So far i focused on outcome of learning not as much about the process. First time i feel that i have many tools to learn new things.
Well done, straight to the point, I couldn't imagine better course on the subject. I actually read a lot about this subject in different books, this is by far the best and more concise one. Cheers
Helped me a lot and continues to help me with everyday learning. It has made me become more passionate about self-driven learning! Thank you so much for this well-organized and interesting course.
Includes techniques to work harder I heard of, lots I probably haven't  heard of.  More concise than other sources of techniques to work hard.  Hopeful that it will be very helpful for my studies.
This was my first course on Coursera and I could not have a better start! The course is amazing and it is a gift for all your life, not only while you are sittin in a chair and studyin. Thank you!
Great course. Lots of useful tidbits and science behind learning that can be useful for practical applications when learning. I wish I had this course as one of the first courses I take in college
I have always struggled with procrastinating MOOCs, and finally, I may say that Learning How to Learn  was the cure. This is the first MOOC that I have completed, looking forward to finish others.
Absolutely loved this course with a very engaging presenter. I wish I had learned these techniques years ago as I am sure I would have taken a lot more in my memory and done better with my degree.
Its amazing how some otherwise simple techniques can improve your learning experience. I learnt new techniques on how to learn. I also appreciated the techniques I have been using sub consciously.
This course clears all my mental blocks regarding the process of learning. If you think that this is not a professional level course I would say this course will make learning as  your profession.
This is what every student and learner should go through once. I will practice by sharing my learning with friends and families ... THANK YOU A LOT... Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
I've learned very easy, powerful and fundamental tricks on how to learn, these tricks since I finished the course have been helping me not only in my studies but also in some decisions in my life
This course is an successful  application of psychology and neuroscience in learning. Although I am a student in psychology, it open my eyes and mind to know how I could learn better than before.
I have already put into motion things I learned in the course and all I can say is they work. As long as you don't just sit on the information and put them into action you will have much success.
Acquired great concepts and techniques on learning especially new things and hard subjects.Obtained some knowledge on how the brain works, which is useful in learning when applied the principals.
its the great course!!! I find new technique of learning and find a lot of information how work memory, our brain. I highly recommend this course - It will your first step for learning everything

Amazing techniques for learning and very nice teachers. This course teaches you techniques that are not only useful in learning other things but are also useful in life. A must for every learner.
I think that this is a necessary course for everybody who are eager to learn  at any age. It helps me to improve my methods of learning. I wish I were taught these skills at school at early ages.
This course is really useful for all kind students, even for people looking for learning something new. I apply its tips while learning the driver's manual and working out on chess book readings.
I wish I'd known all that as a university student! This course is really changing my life. I definetly will recomend to my fellow lecturers, coaches and professors. Thank you very much LHTL team!
Bravo Barb and Terry! Awesome course; I learned many concepts and tips I will certainly employ in my quest for knowledge and understanding. I can't thank you enough for your efforts on this MOOC!

Very easy to follow, understand and remember. Barbara and Terrence apply their learning and neuroscience knowledge to this course, so learning guaranteed. Would like to have more MOOCs like this!
