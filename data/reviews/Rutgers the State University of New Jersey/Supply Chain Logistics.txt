Unfortunately I think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for, it has a very local perspective of logistics (not involving international logistics but only US operations), there's no communication with the professor or assistants, so it's basically watching a few very short videos explaining general concepts that apply only to certain types of operations. The assignments are very vague, with no requirements or restrictions provided, basically anyone can write anything and as long as you follow the requested format it will be graded ok; grading is not based content and therefore there's no way to know whether you're learning and applying the concepts properly or not.Wouldn't recommend paying for it.
This class is an extremely basic course, with very little "rigor" required to complete.  There were a very small number of "bits and pieces" of information that was useful, but most of the information was not followed up on in a practical manner.  I suspect that this course is primarily designed to be a "money generator"  for Rutgers University.  I also suspect that it is very successful in that a vast majority of the students that I could "see" were from foreign countries.  Their submissions were appallingly poor.  Yet, with very little effort, I have no doubt that they passed the "course" and earned their certificates.  I sincerely hope that this course is not a representative example of the type of rigor applied to full college classes at Rutgers.  If it is, it speaks volumes about the quality of a degree from that institution.
I'm sorry I just un-enrolled from this specialization because unfortunately the Instructor didn't mention all the details in real life how it works and wanted us to design something I never heard of ! this the second time I take a course I didn't Like on coursera !!!
Coursera failed to provide an adequate level of customer service and care.  I signed up for the free trial and due to extenuating circumstances there was a mistaken in my subscription cancellation.  The "Coursera Community Team" essentially copy-pasted a boiler plate refund rejection response to my request for refund.  They couldn't refund me for this type of issue, then I realize they are not worth my future business nor recommendation to others.  Very disappointed.
Course has no protection over peer reviews that are grossly unfair. Try calling Coursera's chat assistant and, after waiting for more than 30 minutes, there's nobody there to assist you.
I wasn't intellectually stimulated. This course was your typical run of the mill learning.
It is horrible. The professor is not engaging at all.
It is so basic and simple.
Pathetic
Course content was good. But I had to wait for 3 -4 weeks to get my certificate. As my peer Review assignment was not assessed  by anyone  for more than 3 weeks even after the given deadline was over. That is a very pathetic experience .
i have not received my certificate still i have co completed it please help me to get it
I was learning up until Week 4 Assignment. I thought it was a very ambiguous assignment. I struggled how to learn to create map in Google maps, and saw now way to save the file?I did learn from the course, but found this last assignment to be confusing, ambiguous, and frustrating due to trying to learn to use the tools (Google Maps) while at same time doing the assignment. So, I basically gave up on this one and submitted low quality test, out of frustration. I did learn and will continue finding articles on logistics, reading, and seeking employment in this area. I really think Coursera should UP the quality of their courses and assignments. Throwing crap together and calling it a learning opportunity is a waste of learners time.
Course material was good but stopped short in a couple of areas I felt it needed to go into to have real value.  e.g. the location and number of depots is important and here's why, but no material covering the practical side of how.This became really evident when grading the assessments for that module, one example included a solution where they had placed a depot next door to each customer, giving 10 depots to service 10 customers, I can in no way imagine this is a good or realistic solution.This is my second minor issue with the course, the assessment criteria is more focused on was the assessment completed rather than was to content any good (which is understandable given its peer reviewed and most will not be qualified to judge the quality of the content.).  In many ways I felt this devalued the certificate for completing the course.
There was a lot of missing information required to make an assessment about the efficiency of both warehousing design and network distribution, and yet the assignments were asking for an assessment and justification.  Students would either have to make up a reason or leave it blank, which I think is half the subject matter.  Also, the assessment questions weren't accurately written, so that when you go to assess peer responses you are asked to include things in the grading rubric that were not listed in the assignment.  On every assignment I had to go back and add things to my submission after seeing the items we were going to be graded on.  I've taken other courses that weren't this badly worded.
This was my first online course through Coursera. This is a VERY basic introduction to the structure of a supply chain. The instructor glosses over many concepts that I would have very much liked further detail on. Concepts like - Pick to Light, inventory systems, sQ and sR methods. At one point the 7R's of logistics are mentioned, but then never listed. This is intended to be a four-week course. I'm glad it allows you to work ahead because it really only required about 45 min of work per unit. I would have been quite upset if I had to pay anymore than the $40 monthly fee for this course. I'm hesitant about taking the follow up full Specialization if it's going to be more of this.
The information was great but I was SOL when trying to ask for help on a quiz. The professor didn't respond back to any of my emails or post about the quiz.
This course is very very basic.No technical or in-depth knowlodge provided.Suitable for students of class 4 maybe.Nonetheless -assignments were OK
If you are not taking exams, you will not be able to "mark" the course as complete. The videos are informative but short (2-4 mins).
Very short course with very little information. I found peer graded system isn't that well. It differs from person to person.
In my opinion it is short of important contents and some of the tasks are not very productive to learn logistics concepts;
A subject of logic has been made theoretical and memory game. That is not what Supply Chain Is. Really disappointed.
Missing connections between information and assignments and I found found the course rather shallow.
you have access to the material, but you have to pay 80 USD to take simple quizzes....
Although this is a introductory course the theoretical explanations are a bit poor...
it's basic, and the instructions of submitting assignments are not enough.
It did not provide much depth, highly unsatisfactory
Poorly designed course with a very basic explanation
Very Basically course about Logistics,
Too little content for the price.
not much useful
it's very basic
* Presentation style and showing locations is a good idea
* Course content is not bad
* Assignments requirements are not clear and there are not enough givens to help us start solving the assignment
* There are a lot of unknown terms which I see for the first time and this makes the course harder for me, so the instructor should define these terms instead of relying on our knowledge which is not existing by the way
I think that the proffesor should explain more. I was a total beginner and I have to do a lot of research by my own.
The content of the course was pretty good. I did not like that a lot of the links and content were outdated, and sometimes the quizzes had questions that were no covered in the content. Also the grading for projects needs a better system. Right now it is peer reviewed and the only way to pass is to basically beg for reviews and that is if your lucky enough to get three reviews and even if there is anyone taking the class at the same time.
If you are new to SCM, then this course can render useful information. If you from the industry, then use this course to validate your experience. The most valuable skill I learned was creating a custom map using Google Maps. Also of note, it's painfully obvious that Rudolf Leuschner, Ph.D., the course instructor, has zero industry experience.
It it too hard to get your assignments graded. All the discussion threads are filled with students requesting others to review the assignment. Took multiple requests to get mine evaluated. Study material is great but the assignment really needs review.
I think the contents and assignments of the course were good, nevertheless the interaction with teachers and other fellow students could be improve and enhance the learning experience.
I think the course is more suitable for people from America. At least let us submit the assignments based on the logistic network present in our home countries.
Good for broad-level understanding. Would have liked more details and case studies. Also actual video of a parcel from the start to the finish would be great.
Very basic approach of the concepts. Course should probably approach more deeply showing more real life examples. Overall it was quite interesting.
It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I wish the course had more in-depth discussion of topics and more technical material.
More content could have been delivered and in network logistics calculation of time and distance could have been clearly explained.
Good course for a brief introduction on Logistics, could go deeper in the details and mechanisms of creating a logistics network.
Very good course.Thanks to the respected teacher. Some assignments were really hard and i could have used some more explanation.
This course is good only to give an overview of supply chain logistics, but it does not give little deep to in depth knowledge.
A good class for having a general overview, but it is missing more detailed information about specific and important topics.
This course lacks much explanation even on the basic logistics concepts and halfheartedly  explains whats left.
method of assignment to pass is no good for me.More better is a quiz to passNeed feedback from teacher
yes for beginner it is good but as you give assignments to create Layouts it is more expectation
Is okay if you are looking for a truly introductory course on what is supply chain logistics
Great introductory class on logistics. Require some additional depth on real life scenarios.
I would've like to learn more about inventory management! or maybe reverse logistics
It includes several information about logistics field but it is not so sophisticated
was precise and to the point but some points needed to be explained more
IF provide us with links that may help us to access to some reference.
Interesting statistics and best case practices. Too light.
I want to see more quizzes and less assignments.
More theoretical not much applications
The assignment could include MCQs.
A very good course for logistics
it is good but not that much
I wanted it to be in more detail
This course made it very easy to relate supply chain logistics to real life instances through the use of networks of known companies and how their logistics network are organized. Examining the different modes of transport and how they impact the expected lead times for delivery; while saving the company money in the process was also valuable. Warehousing layout and designing was a very rewarding experience. Also being able to design our own logistics network.
Good basic supply chain training.
The peer graded assignments firstly have too much of weightage, and secondly the reviewers don't necessarily grasp the questions / answers correctly and unknowingly grade incorrectly. A better alternative should be evaluated or ways to improve the accuracy of peer grading needs to be thought of. Apart from it, the course is decent enough being an introductory course not needing too much time dedication per week.
The course material was fantastic; I truly got something out of the videos, readings, and assignments. Other courses on the platform should mimic Rutgers' video length, concise readings, and practical interactive assignments. However, rubrics for and the general idea of peer-reviewed grading should be scrutinized. While the projects themselves were great learning experiences, having grades based on quizzes with precise or exact answers provides for less ambiguity than assignments with more open-ended rubrics.
I found it a very interesting course and the assignments were not too easy, which is good. I just felt that there could have been more content than what we have had to earn the Supply Chain Logistics certificate. I am sure there is so much more that is extremely important to know, but that is just my personal opinion. For the rest I want to thank the people who have set up this course for making it fun and personal as well as interacting with peers. It was a huge success.
Assignments required you to apply knowledge from the lectures and were challenging if you strive to really demonstrate all of the principles throughout, especially the final exam.   As a perfectionist, I spent a lot of time to ensure my assignments were comprehensive and reflect the knowledge I learned for all four weeks.  On bit of constructive criticism is that I think the assignments could be explained more clearly. Very reasonable cost for the course.
This is a really good foundation for people who don't have any background knowledge about this field, it's easy to understand. However, when it comes to tests or assignments there were somethings that not included in the lesson but we have to go on with it if we want to complete the tasks, but it's not a big issue anyway since we can do a little research to understand it. To sum up, this course can help you if you want to learn this field.
I love the way in which the information is provided by professor Rudolg Leuschner. He present the information in different venues and tries to make it more visual.As it is said in the course description, this is just an introduction, so I miss further information about the topics covered in this course. Anyways, it fulfills the objectives and provides you with the basics about Logistics.Thanks a lot for this leaning opportunity.
It good course.  Professor is cute and exert.  I like when professor teach in real situation such as in warehouse, at train station, at truck transport firm. But It is too many peer review assignment >> that make me waste my time for waiting peer to review >> Cause I can not control duration time in specialization 'I don't like finishing course depending on others that have no interest to review my assignment.'
The course could've gone in-depth into the types of vehicles used, what is the procedure to send goods over air frieght and also covered the ship mode also. I feel ship modes are very essential which I did not find in this course. Also, a case study ( for e.g the F1 logistics or NFL logistics problems would've been a great help). I liked the professor's outlook and relateable method of teaching though.
I always used to wonder, as to how were this logistics companies with high variability, volume and precision. This course gave an insight with all the basic steps involved. The assignments were a major push to read more and apply what all was discussed in the course. I did not have much experience with online classes, but if this is how things are done, it quite cool to head a head start!
I loved the course from the very beginning to the end, the assignments and quizzes were insanely brain storming.  Anyone willing to know the secret behind the logistics network, this is for you. Kudos to the tutor. It was worthwhile.  Just a suggestion to update the links in more to read section as many of the pages are no more available and many have been altered.
Relevant, accurate, and helpful material. The Videos, with Learning Opportunities embedded in, are great. However, very much dislike the method of submitting peer-graded assignments: 3 text blocks are not in correct order and do not all have equal functionality. Why have a single, fully functional text block or option to upload assignment as Word Doc or PDF or PPT?
It is paced well for a online specialization course and it needs to pursued until  the 5 courses are done. I would assume the lectures and the study material would get more interesting and the assignments tougher. It is required to cover the topic and provide us the education in Supply Chain. I enjoyed going back to learning and this has been an experience.
Quite good, it is the first course that I have completed in Coursera. The instructor provides some realistic experience in the logistics systems. The problem I have faced that the peers are not honest mostly, I submit an assignment in good but they did not provide the points I deserved. So, I have to re submit the assignment again and again.
the learning material and readings are too general and short, so I find the assignment difficult to complete. Besides, it was good as a start in this topic wish to see more scientific information in the next course of this specialization. Also, some of the extra sources (links) are not working or not available anymore.
This was great learning experience. The teacher explanation was too good to understand and which helped me to match with daily life . I struggle in some place because the entire subject content is based on US. Students like me who is from outside and taking this course is really struggling to work in assignments.
A great introductory course to the logistics component of the supply chain that allowed me to get an overall view of logistics behind any modern supply chain.The teacher introduces all the most relevant concepts and valuable exercises in a passionate manner.It was worth every minute of my dedication and study.
Great for an overview of Logistics, and a simple grounding in: terminology, selecting transit options, warehouse layouts, and logistic network structure. I would have like more detail, for example incoterms. Instructor was easy to understand and moderately entertaining (which I enjoyed).
The contents of this course is very basic and everyone can understand, the quiz and assignments are arranged attractive and challenging. However there are some terms not explained well in the video. I hope the video can be a little bit longer so it can cover more concepts specifically.
Really enjoyed the course. A lot of good material that I enjoyed exploring. Very clear, concise and understandable. If I could add something, I'd like to go more in depth of subject, as I work in this field. That's the reason I'm enrolling in the next Supply Chain Operations course.
It was good enough considering that it is a beginner level course. I would be happier if my assignments were checked by instructors. Thus the 4 star. But as a beginner level course this was fairly easy. I understand that it was done to encourage people to take the second course
I feel like this course, along with the other courses in this specialization, doesn't cover in-depth applications of supply chain management. The course material covers only the basics, and does not adequately prepare a student to take on a job in supply chain management.
The course is very informative . I in particular was aware of the subject, but I realized after the course that the knowledge was superfluous. This course gave me the insight to the intricacy of the topic, the required calculation etc. Over all it was very knowledgeable.
This was a good course . However there were areas that needed improvement for explanations for example - (broken cases explanation )related to warehouse design /layouts .Cross docking explanation in the transportation assignment I feel could have been explained more .
I generally enjoyed the course, but I wish there was a bit more of a taste of the math that would be involved when really diving into Supply Chain Management. As it is, I don't think this course really prepares you for an entry level job in the field.
As such the course content was very good and useful for developing the concepts. I would advise the content design team to expand the teaching examples to areas outside of the US as well, as the business conditions in other regions might be different.
I think this course is a great form to learn about logistic, because in each video the teacher explains the topic with puntual concepts that in the assignments must to do. I'd liked to not only be in US if not in Europe, Asia or South America, too.
A great learning course for the overall concept of Supply Chain with specific focus towards logistics. I did expect the assignments to be more thorough (more detailed), but felt it was quite vague. Yet, this course explains alot of the comebacks.
Content was interesting however after the first peer assignment, I noticed that the audience of this course are not serious about learning.  (i.e. submitted random and empty answers) Hence dropping my interest in completing this course.
I really enjoyed this course! The videos were clear and there were nice links included to some additional reading. Point of improvement: The course is a lot based on peer reviewed assignments, for which I did not get a lot of feedback.
Peer review is somehow unfair. some people don't read thoroughly and gives unfair score, and all of the grade is reviewed by peer review only. Other than that, Course has good contents and you will take some insights from the course.
It was a great learning experience, definitely learned something new and useful. one thing though quizzes could have been a bit more friendly if questions had multiple choice instead of asking the answer in written type
The course was good. Taught me the basics of transportation.It can teach in more detail of how things are actually managed in warehouse and transportation. Also the knowledge of how exactly logistics network is designed
I would like to receive more technical knowledges. Also, the final assessment should be reviewed by a professor in order to release effective feedbacks, which are sometimes not released at all from the course mates.
A good overview for supply chain Logistics with crisp and to the point content, great write up and adequate video's to support and guide for the subject. Strongly suggest people to enroll and get an insight to this
This course was really great. Interactive peer assignments were specifically very fun. I learned about logistics, modes of transport, designing warehouses and a lot more. It's good to know the basics of logistics.
It is very interesting and provided me with so much information and i have learned a lot, it was fun learning something new ,  but it needs more details, more practical examples and discussions from the lecturer
The course was great and I enjoyed doing the assignments. I wouldn't mind having longer videos to watch. Overall it was amazing. Once you start getting good marks in the quiz , you feel keep going on.
its a very helpfull course because as a begginer you need to start from the easy thinks and the do more difficult. I like it very much and for sume it was a good introduction for the logistics world.
I liked it very much. Some links were not avaiable and need to be updated. In the final project, you need to include an attachment for the transit times. There is just one for the logistics network.
it was good introduction to logistics i suggest taking the idioms from videos and google it to have better understanding for each term , the course lack a little bit of explanation.
The amount of study material is limited, but the quality is good and it definitely touches all the general topics and it gives a foundation for understanding supply chain logistics!
It's a good introductory course for people who wants to start learning about Supply Chain Management. The materials are delivered in fun and engaging way, but still understandable.
Good program but needs to be clubbed with the whole supply chain management specialization as a standalone course may not provide the full knowledge across the Supply chain subject
I enjoyed the course, we had lots of examples through the videos but they were really short, but if you want to start your studies in SCM this is a good course for an entry level.
The course is very useful though it can be made more elaborate with more videos & reading materials. Also, assignments are very specific related to the US, it can be made generic.
It was my first course and it was an interesting one. The assignments were very interesting and fun to work on. Kudos to Prof. Leuschner for designing such an awesome course!
Supply Chain Logistics is really an interesting subject where I have learned a lot about warehouse/warehouse design, logistics/logistics network. It gives whole information.
The course is not very detailed only giving you hints about how logistics work on Supply Chain Management. The in-video quizzes are the worst. Overall, satisfactory course.
A nice introduction on concepts related to logistics, applied into interesting and stimulating assignments. Suggested course, especially for people interested in the topic.
I found this course interesting as it applies directly to my present job.  It helped me put in perspective additional factors to be considered in the field of logistics.
Good intro to logistic and supply chain. Well explained and interesting assignments to help put your knowledge into practice. Definitely will continue with next courses.
Very structured and challenging course, Gave the basic understanding of how the supply chain in logistics works and the assignments peaked the interest to look deeper.
It is a good course to start on a Journey of Supply Chain Management. The faculty is great and the delivery is very effective.  The assignments are interesting too.
its a good course for those who want to know more about supply chain and how it works, i was able to learn many new things and experience  new tools and practices.
Couldn't find better option than this. Great introductory part of logistics with quality course materials. It helps a lot to form the basis of supply chain.
Good souse. It refreshes one's basics. but more stress needs to be given on terms and Key words. Also Week 2 and week 3 were not designed well.
It is Good Course i have learnt in this whose organisation planning for selecting Mode of transport, ware house planning and what factors influ
peer graded assignments should be a little simpler, these are very complicated. good for learning perspective but takes a heavy toll on time.
This course give a brief idea of how the supply chain logistics network works and how can I implement my idea. To me the course was fine.
This course gives the basic knowledge of supply chain management and assignment enables learner to apply the needed practical knowledge.
It was thought provoking and interesting .The assignments where fun.I have good understanding of logistics .Rudolf is a fun instructor.
As I have no previous text-book knowledge concerning Logistics I am happy with this introductory as it gave me an initial understanding
as mentioned in the description It will not take you to the depth and breath of the topic but for the understanding it is good course.
The content of this course is very useful and detail for a new starter however I can not see sea transportation method in this course.
This course is really great cleare my basic concept for logistics and other related parts. This course really adds value in my future.
Got to know the basic concepts of the supply chain logistics. Looking forward to apply it in real life and learn in much more detail
A good short-term course for Beginners. The best part being the assignments, which creatively attaches to the classroom concepts.
Good course ... the course materials were helpful and the way the concepts were presented was really good ... highly recommended!
Really entry level course with not too much content. If you are a faster learner, you can expect to finish this course in a week.
The course is really good and shows the fundamentals of Supply Chain Logistics. I just think it could go deeper on some topics.
Good kickstart for those who are rookies in the field. But for people with prior knowledge in this field, it is a slow course.
Best Course and that is most effective in the Supply chain field,and Instructor is the best way to how to deliver the lecture.
It is a good foundation course for supply chain logistics. One can learn about basic ideas of how to build logistics network
Quizzes could have been more elaborate and with a higher difficulty level... Course content also could have been a bit more.
This is a very good course to have a general overview what are the components of Supply Chain and Logistics and how it works
Excellent content within this course enabling one to understand the strategy behind the building of a logistics network.
options to upload documents need to be re-looked into. Candidates need to be reminded not to be partial while grading.
this is a very good course for beginners and assignments if done properly will make u confident in this field...
This course was very helpful for basic level of understanding.  Images & Videos was awesome and very practical.
Really good course to understand warehouse design, warehouses network and market drivers in logistics business.
it is basic lecture to understand logistic, I recommend you guys to listen this lecture and improve your skills
Some items appear to be a bit out of date... would be nice if more recent articles or resources were provided.
Good information, I would have liked a little greater detail in the reading material and the video lectures.
I love this course        !!!& I am willing to finish Harder Just as I am willing to have anew career Path.
The Course was fun to do as it involved the hands-on exercise of what we just learned from the concepts.
The peer graded assignment should be flexible in deciding area so that students can their own area.
As an intro to logistics is fine, more information or mor examples with data on them would be great
This is really helpful for career and capacity building. Course materials and lectures is explicit
It was very useful course and i got to learn a lot of things on warehouse management and inventory
Including few details on the technologies used today to manage warehouses would be a good addition
very great experience in learning the basics of the logistics network in supply chain management
Very much informative course where the data is very preciese to the knowledge what is required.
Good and easy course. The content was very lucid. I think difficulty level could be increased.
Little improvisation is required! Content provided is basic but i loved the peer assignments!
IT was interesting but I thought that we could explore a litle bit more. its a basic course.
Great assignment which encapsulates all learning an requires all course material to be used.
It was a fun experience, However, Quizzes and Assignments should be graded by instructors!
This course was very concise but was enough to get the basics of supply chain management.
Learning in a fun filling way. Wonderful experience. Good instructor, Thank you Coursera
As a beginner,the course is very helpful for learning the basics of supply chain.Thanks.
It is a very important course to know when you want to work or have to run a wearhouse.
The experience of learning this course was amazing. Thankyou coursera and the teacher .
very good, however there were too many peer review tests that isnt leveled in marking.
i think the course should go deeper a little bit. however,the material is fascinating
it was concise! which is good for those who would like to tap on supply chain briefly
Interesting course.  I really appreciate the course content and way it is provided.
Very informative course if you are pursuing a career in the supply chain industry.
Great introduction course to basic logistics concepts. I love peer-graded system
More detailed discussion and reference of some good textbooks will be helpful.
Could be more in-depth. Overall, great course to understand concepts of SC Log
A course for beginner only. If you already know basics go for advanced coarse.
It is ver information course which help you to build your logistics network .
It was so informative course . Plus the assignment will really help you a lot
If the teaching style is more elaborate than it may very easy to understand.
Not too many lectures, but the assignments help understand most of concepts.
Shorter than expected but with interesting information and fun assignments!
The basic understanding for beginner is sutaibally given for the students.
Excellent information. Quizzes and tests need to correspond with lectures.
I cannot download my certificate. Can you please describe me how can i ?
Very useful course and I learned a lot regarding supply chain management
I enjoyed learning the warehousing techniques and logistics networking
The course is very awesome, informative and practically disseminated.
The course is a very basic course in logistics with no math involved.
Very good way to get introduced to how and what a supply chain is.
All videos and notes were aptly placed. quizzes in between the v
Very easy even for someone without any background in logistics
It's a nice course which is needed in every aspect of industry
its very good course to learn and certificate is also helpful.
very interesting and gives you a nice overview about logistics
Very nice course for those who want to get into supply chain
Content of the course is super and practically oriented one
VERY EASY TO FOLLOW AND GOOD COURSE FOR THE FIRST TIMERS.
Nice experience especially in the last assignment session
High quality of material, however it is too much begineer
I leared many needed knowledge in Supply Chain Logistics!
Great basic level course to understand the core concepts!
It is an interesting course and I learned a lot form it
Great course especially Assignment section is awesome.
get a good experience.but this grading system is poor.
Nice structured assignments and videos also insightful
This is one of the future's most important businesses
Great course to get one going on Logistics management
nice course.less theory and more practical examples.
This course was enjoyable while being informative.
Need some more assignment with competitive scoring
Its a good course to understand basic of logistics
Some peer assignment are bit difficult. isnt it ?
Good overview. Helpful to refresh your knowledge.
Very helpful for the beginners must apply for it
I love it so much! this is a lovely course to me
it was very useful and i got a lot of knowledge
The course could have been a bit more detailed
some of the topics were not clearly described
nice overview and good exercises for practice
Good course, but wanted more detailed videos
Good, but more tools could have been taught.
some updates to the material should be made
The Explanation could had been more detail.
it is just overview , not in depth course!!
Learned the basics of logistics very well!
learnt many new things about supply chain
The course was good but it was too short.
Rudolf Leuschner you are great instructor
Lack of interaction with the instructor .
Mathematical expressions are not there...
I Learnt the basic concepts of Logistics
learned basic of supply chain management
Need Improvement in the course contents
provide logistics system in a nutshell
Good course. Don't miss the learning.
Interesting Material, Fun Assignments
good assignments and basic knowledge
its   so helpful for me in my life
peer reviewing is not satisfactory
a bit general but ok for overview
Good Course well structured ....
good learnings from this course
Great! Looking forward for more
Very good introduction course.
this is amazingly interested.
Could have been made tougher.
It's a good course to study.
nice material for beginners
Good introductory course!
interesting presentation
Learned a Lot's Thanks!
Straight-forward, basic
could go more in-depth
Was a good course!!
The assignments:(
It's very useful.
very efficient
Good course,
Amazing instructor! Very fun and interesting course, learned many useful tools like a warehouse design and logistics challenges. Would recommend for people in and outside of logistics network
The course gives you the knowledge of supply chain logistics from the beginner level to the pro level.The assignments are application-orientedBest course for better and easy understanding.
Material is short and straight to the point. It is also presented in an exciting and easy to follow manner. Good job!
This course was well organized, provided necessary learning materials, and hands-on learning experiences.  I would highly recommend this course to others interested in learning supply chain logistics.
This course is really helpful. It helps to get a basic understanding of Logistics. The trainer is absolutely solution-focused, giving live scenario examples. I am glad I opted for this course. Now I am starting to write the final exam so that I can have the certification as well. One should definitely join this course if looking for an overview of SCM.
I like this course, particularly the assignment. The deign of the assignment is very constructive. The requirement is very clear and need to check many data off line. That's help us to understand the knowledge more deeply.
Adequately detailed and informative educational videos. With sufficient links to external resources, study materials & reference information. The tests and exams helped reinforce the study material.
The course covers many Logistic issues such as Transportation , Inventory , Logistic network , and the assignments provide you good way of thinking and methods to solve issues
Great learning! Assignments were fun to complete. Overall  a complete package with practical assignments to complete. Thank you
This course is really value to anyone who would like to work on Supply Chain Field
This is one of the best course of Supply Chain Management Specialization offered by Rutgers University through Coursera. Equally important to the individuals already working in supply chain and who are looking for their career in supply chain. Learning method, course material and instructor everything is very encouraging and cooperative. I am lucky to have this course. Thankyou coursera and Rutgers University.
This course is very much useful for beginners and the terminologies used in this course are very simple and easily understandable. I would prefer this course to my friends who are interested in getting some knowledge in logistics.

Professor was awesome, very informative and really brought the lectures to life. Leaps and bounds better that some of the other professors teaching courses in coursera.

The professor gives a thorough introduction to the general
I took this great course, due to I would like to have better understandings
and more valuable knowledge in Logistics Field although I had attended some
free Logistics Seminars in Myanmar and free short courses provided by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Myanmar Port Authority's training Center

experiences in Sea Freight and Air Freight Import and Export operations with
World Wide Shipping Agents and Carriers. Anyway, this is a very great course!! Because it is easier to understand and also with flexible timing to do the assignments and complete.

Best material/pattern/course on subject !
Extremely informative! Thank you!
Very helpfull
I started this course to learn concepts that would help me push my supply chain career forward and this course sure met my expectations. Concepts were clearly explained and assignments were simple yet  challenging to dive deep. I love the fact that during videos there are intermittent quizzes and they help me focus more on the content and listen attentively. Also, I appreciate the concept of reviewing your peers assignment once you  finish and submit yours would stretch my thinking and help me identify, learn different ways of approaching a problem. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this course and hope to apply these concepts at work. Thank you Coursera and professor. With this motivation, I'll be signing up for more courses that I think would enhance my abilities and grow at my work place.
I don't remember when was the last time I had this much fun while learning something. The practical aspects of the assignments were amazing and further reinforced everything I learned throughout the course. But it is a real shame that peer-graded assignments in Coursera aren't moderated by the administration. I know it is probably a very difficult task to monitor every submission, but some people literally beg others in the discussion segment for 100% marks. Some even get full grades by submitting extremely sub-par content. And many peers don't even put in the slightest bit of effort while grading others' assignments. It's really sad and very demotivating.
I actually really enjoyed this course. I appreciate the effort put into the course and the notes. I know that most online professors have many options to actually avoid such work or even jeopardize the learning of the student. This was my first online course and I would like to thank you for the great experience. I know I had one issue with peer graded assignment but that was just a really unavoidable situation on my part. Hopefully, it didn't destroy my chance for a good grade in the course since I worked very hard. Anyways, this was an awesome course and I will advise online courses for my fellow students that have tight schedules.
It was an interesting learning journey.I liked it too much.great I would like to heartily thank Rutgers University and Coursera for  the opportunity they  give to me to improve my skills and knowledge .Thank you Coursera for serving humanity by widening the scope of accessibility to  high quality learning resources almost for free  and with access to financial aids for courses and programs that fee based  .I am glad my application for financial aid to enroll for Supply Chain Management Specialization was approved and for completion of the first course .Hope you everlasting success .Yaser Sultan Alselwi  from Republic of Yemen .
I completed Supply Chain Logistics course today. Thank you very much Coursera for giving me this opportunity to learn online in such an esteemed university (Rutgers University).

I must say this course helps me to understand the basics and hands on experience of Logistics terminology which helped me gaining new skills. Thanks and looking forward to learning many more skills online in the years tom come.

I am grateful for this course which I owe to the Rutgers University to support my journey to become part of their online platform course and to become Supply Chain Management professional someday. I will strive to continue again to apply other prerequisite courses and study hard to get my Professional Supply Chain Management to this privilege opportunity.
It was an fantastic course designed to complete through online. It helped me a lot to know about new knowledge on SCM. I had no idea before completing this course. But this course helped me to think in a new way to design and make plan for the supplying. I was staying at home due to the recent pandemic and within this time I have completed this course.

Great and Excellent Course. All concepts were covered in a elegant manner. It was a very practical course and the peer grade assignments improved my learning a lot. I think this a great course for learning transportation and I would highly recommend others to enroll in this as well. The instructor was clear and precise. The key course advantage is of peer graded assignments which were highly practical in nature and will help in jobs in the future. Thank you
I had enjoyed the course however there is more that needs to improved such as the terms used in warehousing and logistics should be explained as well and more examples are needed to increase the understanding of the concept. Am saying this because people come from different nationalities and it is better to be more detailed to some concept, for me i had no problem because i have a background in supply chain thou i had challenges on assignments.
As a beginner in Supply Chain Management, this course was completely new to me. However, I loved the content and the way the course had creative assignments. Professor Rudi teaches really well and the fact that it wasn't just him taking into a screen from a room made a difference. I liked that he was outside and showing me what an actual Warehouse looked like and what happened there as I have zero experience about it.
The lecture series talks about the various aspects of the logistics industries. The assignments provide an opportunity to apply the learning knowledge into practice. Every lecture video is followed by a written summary which is great for writing notes. In addition to the course materials, the lecturer Rudy is quite humorous and has his own way of delivering his lectures which made the topic enjoyable to watch/learn.
This course focuses more on practical assignments rather than teaching through text or videos. The videos will be very short but you will have to spend some time on the assignments. Through these assignments, you get a hands-on approach which I feel made my understanding of the topic better. The instructor, however, does not explain concepts and terms in an elaborate way.
The course is a very good introduction to the world of Supply Chain. It details the parts of the logistics network and the assignments allow you to apply the knowledge in a practical manner. The peer-reviewed assignments are appropriately challenging, in the sense that they ensure you gain a thorough understanding of the principles of the Logistics of the Supply Chain.
I liked this course. It provides a good understanding of Supply Chain Logistics in general. I will recommend this course to anyone who wants to start her/his career in logistics and wants to know more about the logistics. The course is filled with great assignments where one can show her/his skills and apply the knowledge that was acquired through every module.
A simple and useful course on logistics in the context of supply chain management that helps even learners who have no previous experience to learn these topics which are of great importance in the modern world.  Assignments with a practical  orientation, good quality of audio and video and a great instructor are other points worth mentioning.
This was a really interesting course. I learnt how to design a layout of warehouse & how to built logistics network. I also learnt why they are important. Most importantly I learnt how to deliver products to the customers in a short & most efficient way. I will highly recommend this course if you are enthusiastic to learn about supply chain.
Really comprehensive entry course into logistics. All information is digestible and the assignments are quite fun. You will need to leave 2hrs for each of the peer-reviewed assignments in order to get the most out of them. They are not difficult but do take some time, You will get out of this course what you put into it (as in life);
Covers all the aspects and know about of Logistics and its importance in Supply Chain. The assessments really test the level of understanding and how can it be applied in real-life scenarios. The discussion forum helps us put forward our thought process and helps us look at our level of understanding from a different point of view.
I would suggest this course to all those who are interested in Supply Chain Logistics. This course provides you the platform through which you gain the knowledge regarding Supply Chain Logistics. It acts as the place where you get the complete information on What is Supply Chain Logistics all about. It is a wonderful course.
When I joined this course, I was not familiar with how goods where moved from an area of low demand to area of high demand. With the help of the course in Supply Chain Logistics, I was able to plan the logistics and delivery systems for my company. I'd like to thank Rutgers and Coursera for this wonderful opportunity.
This course was a joy to be a part of. Prof Leuschner explains everything in a very lucid manner and the real world implementations shared in the videos make understanding the content very easy. I will definitely continue with other courses in the Supply Chain Management specialization offered by Rutgers University.
The topics covered in this course were extensive and thorough. The assignments were well thought out and ensured that the concepts learned over the course of 4 weeks were well and duly implemented. Learnt a lot from this course and I am looking forward to completing the other courses offered in this specialization.
The course is very structured and easy to follow. It gave basic ideas on warehouse, transportation and the overall structure of logistic networking. The set up of the quiz and assignment is based on real life situation and at the same time  other skills such as creating maps using google map. Recommended course!
Learning was really amazing, specially online teaching method and other resources were so helpful, I appreciate Coursera team for building this great online learning platform for all walk of people, students, business person, specially for all those who cannot organize to go physical classes.

strategically in designing logistic network and implementing decisions. I believe this is
 one of the keys to having an effective and efficient solution in supply chain managment.
The course is very relevant to Industrial/Operations/Management professionals. The instructor explains the thing very well, and everything is best viz. knowledge, explanation, examples, practicality, etc. Thanks a lot to the instructor (Prof. Rudolf Leuschner) for designing the course.
