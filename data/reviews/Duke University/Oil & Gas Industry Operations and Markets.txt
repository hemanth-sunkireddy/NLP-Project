I completed all tasks, ut I could not  obtain any certificate.
it got way too technical and mundane.
TLDR: Good course content, mediocre way of teaching, but evaluation criteria may disappoint you.My first and biggest concern here is grammar being an evaluation criteria for the peer-graded assignment. Coursera says that there's NO PENALTY FOR GRAMMATICAL ERRORS as English is not everyone's native language. Then how is Duke University allowed to include grammar as an evaluation criteria? I can't believe someone rated my grammar less, despite having my document run through Grammarly (and funnily, the person who wrote feedback in the box had way worse English than mine). It's simply because if you give people a chance to be a Grammar-Nazi, they will be one, without any hesitation.My second concern is the professor's way of teaching. He is extremely knowledgeable without a doubt, but isn't engaging at all. Lectures seem like a monologue. There are several other courses on Coursera where there are prompts in between lectures like text boxes or polls, to engage students and help them keep up with the instructor's pace.Coursera, if you're reading this, don't forget to take a look into these.
Nice course but the peer assignment is awful.
Very good technical and economical knowledge about the oil and gas industry. But, the course should contain some notes (pdf or powerpoints).
The material itself is quite comprehensive, short, and acts as a good introductory course for beginners. The reason I gave the course 3 stars is due to its grading scheme for the final report. I applaud the course administrator's in attempting to create more collaboration amongst students and providing learning opportunities through the peer review system. However, the peer review system does not seem very effective at the end of the day in judging an individual's learning outcomes and grading individuals in a constructive manner. Some course participants merely submitted empty files, or even entirely plagiarized materials - and most of the time, the system is extremely easy for participants to game by simply giving one another good scores. The assignment submitted by participants is not that lengthy to begin with. I believe it would be better if there are designated administrators or mentors that can oversee the grading of the final assignments and leave some constructive feedback for participants.
In my opinion the positive thing of this course is bringing a very important area to Coursera. But there are some things that I believe could and should be improved. First, Duke has presented courses that have a lot of content, and it is a bit disapointing to only see two modules on this course. At least four modules should be presented. Also the weekly content should be more extended. In most parts of the course there are a lot of technical concepts, and the course lacks any type of resources. It should had been included the lecture slides and also external sources for further student development. Just having the videos to learn doesn't provide - again in my opinion, a very engaging learning experience. A small detail - in part of the course page the course is entitled Oil & Gas Industries, while in another place is entitled Oil & Gas Industry. A small detail but it should be corrected. This is my opinion.
It could have been more detailed like the explanation about Brent and WTI. Process could have been made more simpler to understand.
The explanation of the topic is so fast to get understand.
Quite superficial. Lecturer constantly reading a script.
Just awesome course very helpful for petroleum engineer.
Its a lot of information clubbed into a small course.
This course could have been a  bit more interactive.
Very good and very knowledgeable course üëçüëç
It was quite slow
It is a very good opportunity for me to refresh my understanding over the whole petroleum industry value chain, from upstream exploration and production to downstream refining and marketing. The overall structure of the course is very good, my only suggestion is that it will be even greater if Dr. Pratson could instruct the lecture with daily speaking English instead of reading the formal written English from the  prompter.
Good Course to get an insight on how things work in the Oil and Gas Sector.
Good course for basic understanding of the oil and gas market.
This course was very informational. I learned a lot about the oil and gas industry. It was easy to follow and sufficient for understanding key concepts. However, I had a big issue with the final assignment. I submitted it three times. Since it's peer graded it caused quite a lot of trouble. I had some people rate me poorly- by saying I didn't include certain information, when I know that I included all required information. I think that the people reading my submission either didn't comprehend the information, or blatantly didn't read it. This caused me to fail and need to submit a second time. At the time of the second submission my computer glitched and didn't send in the document in pdf form. Three of the four students rated the assignment highly- one student rated it all 0s because it wasn't in pdf format causing me to fail a second time. I've now submitted it a third and am hoping for it to be accepted... Overall it has been very frustrating. Good content. Frustrating final assignment that you NEED to pass to earn your certificate.
This course is great for all types of people who want to learn about the Oil and Gas industry in detail. The organization of the course allows students to learn and understand concepts step by step. I would recommend all those who are involved or would like to be involved in the oil and gas industry at any level to take this to have a clear understanding of the bigger system they are part of.
Gained some great insights on conventional oil & gas exploration, processing, costs, pricing & future markets of unconventionals#insightful #resourcefulWould have been great if the pace could have been a bit slower as a lot of information was rushed upon, especially in the exploration part. But hats off to Lincoln Pratson for the training and many thanks to him for sharing the knowledge.
Very detailed yet covers alot of subject matter. Professor is precise and detailed about each topic, while giving good examples. I would recommend this course to any person wishing to get a good snapshot of the Energy Sector and wishing to make a career with any number of direct or indirect companies involved in this industry.
Coursera : request you to add more such course related to Oil & Gas Lincoln Pratson (Duke Uni) : Many Thanks to share such a good knowledge about O&G sectorLearner : if you studied  / studying  economics, business, geography, public policy, environmentalsciences, this course would be a great choice.. Good Luck & Keep Learning
It was a great experience for me . The course is very important for me. Many important topics discussed in this course. As I am mechanical engineering student ,I was too much interested from the beginning of this course. I would like to thanks to "Duke University". And also I would like to thanks to Coursera.Regards.
The course gives a good overview of the Oil & Gas sector. However, in my opinion of engineer, it is too simplified. I would have appreciated to go more in details of the processes and the markets linked to each application. But, Prof Pratson gives a really good explanation and it motivates to follow the course.
It is an excellent course which gives a brief overview of how oil
and gas industry works, how prospects are discovered, how drilling is carried
out, how revenues and profits are generated, how the prices of petroleum
products are determined etc. A must take for beginner level aspirants of energy
sector.
It is a great course. It has many advantages . It also acknowledge our about this hole course. It also gives a batter knowledge about oil & gas industries and it's market opportunities. As I'm 1st year student it gives a brief overview of oil & gas industry. Really, I is a very helpful course.
wonderful course, systematically cover the flow chart of the O&Gd industrial, with analysis of details !!!!  basically the course make me procure  a whole picture of this industrial and specific rules underlying in it.But the it maybe dull a little bit if you are not interested in this topic.
I like the fact it was a free course. However, the project at the end was a bit more burdensome than the rest of the course would lead one to expect. I would like to see the course made longer and to have followup courses as well. Nevertheless, it was clear, straightforward and interesting.
The course is good. However, for the last assignment, I think it will be hard and does not know how to commence the work if you come from the other field such as lawyer or doctor. It should have some example and guideline for creating the company profile for the customer.
Excellent course with very clear insights on the Oil & Gas Industry, its operations and the markets in which these companies have to operate. It provides a good overview on the downstream as well. Very much liked week 2 where the economics are explained. Very well done.
Excellent introduction to oil and gas industry operations and market dynamics. Personally I don't think I am going to be able to remember the nuances of the demand and supply explained here but now I know where I can look for this information when I need it again.
I've been studying oil and gas in my MSc programme. This short but concise course has really helped narrowed most of the things I've studied into summary. The marketing aspect was the only new knowledge but I've really enjoyed the lecture and quizzes.  Thank you
This course covers all details about the Oil and Gas industry keeping in mind the US based model. The only part it lacks a bit of information is refining process of crude oil to get various petroleum products is a bit brief and not detailed.
Really an informative course and highly recommended for all professionals working with oil & gas to get an E2E picture of the overall activities. The instructor has used good combination of the visuals, graphics to explain the concept.
The course was very well taught and managed, it was also very much interesting but the corner in which it can be improved little bit is to provide notes of all videos in pdf so a learner can also review it later when needed.Thankyou
This course briefly elaborates on the essential aspects of oil and gas sector in an easily understandable manner..much useful for enhancing one's career. Thank you Duke university and Prof.Lincoln Pratson for your beautiful lectures
It is really a very good course, especially for someone like me who is a still a sophomore in petroleum engineering and would love to know about the intricacies of the industry of which he is going to be a part in the near future.
It's a very interesting course . it covers the most important parts of Oil and Gas Operations and Markets.very helpful to understand the Oil and Gas Industry. I'm glad to complete this course successfuly and i recommend it.
It could be improved with more knowledge related to the oil and gas industry and it should have more peer-graded assignments, and it could be improved by having at least a group assignment to improve teamwork ability!
Great class. The final peer-graded assignment needs more guidelines on what the format should look like. This causes the grades from peers to range greatly based on what each person thinks it should be.
Being my first finished course, I found it very easy to follow. Though I would include one last chapter with some updated information, since many things have changed  since it was recorded in 2015
A short clear course giving an overview of the oil and gas industries with its extraction,operation, distribution and sales.It's a beginner friendly course with clear explanation and a good quiz.
This is the best course for someone in oil/gas industry. This course only clear basic operations of oil/gas industry but also gives you fundamental knowledge about Oil/gas industry marketing.
it's an interesting overview of the oil and gas industry and market. I'd have appreciated if it was longer than it is. Maybe, if they add another chapter about the economy it'd be better.
At some stages the instructor is blocking viewers from seeing Diagrams properly. Instructor at some point explains a topic in short & rapid manner which results into poor understanding
This course gives a nice insight into the oil and gas industry, even if the student has no prior experience with it. However, the focus on the US was a bit redundant at times.
Good but it is not deep enough, I would like to see a course focused on engineers that look for a course to acquire deeper knowledge.But I am glad with this course, good job!
Good course. Rarely, the lecturer goes too fast, or does not stop to explain a new concept. Happened a couple times. But, I gained valuable insight from this course.
This course contain current and global information about Oil and Gas Industry. In my opinion, is necesary implement excersices about real problems for all modules
Excellent course, especially for people practicing in the oil and gas industry. Gives you a clear view of various factors that affect operations in the industry.
The  Professor  way of explaining was very Unique .This Course is very good for beginners Specially Who are interested to start  their    Job oil and Gas sector.
Very good overview about the Industry, but information is too little, perhaps providing some more indepth insight towards the end of the course could be better.
this cours present the upstream midstrem and downstream of the oil and gas in all details. so it will important for every students and worker in this sector.
The course I choose which related to my department and it is useful to know more concepts related to oil and gas exploration costs etc.. And then marketing.
Great Course!I would prefer if it contains more demonstrative slides and reading materials, so it would be easier to absorb these interesting information.
Lincoln Pratson is an eminent personality and the way he delivered the course is pleasant and insightful. Thanks, Coursera for featuring such instructors
This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. I learn so much about oil and gas industry , i'ts very helpful  for the futur

This is a brilliant summary of all aspects of the Oil & Gas industry. Each section is clearly presented with high quality videos, and I felt as if I was in front of the professor. This course may be considered for beginners but even for well experienced professional such as myself (more that 22 years in the downstream segment) it is a welcomed refresher of the industry as a whole. I highly recommend this course
Very rich and informative course. This course provides an exhaustive introduction towards the Oil and Gas market, it covers all the factors and parameters with great detail. Enjoyed it thoroughly!
All lessons were brief, concise and straight to the point.  Mr Pratson was so professional! I enjoyed every bit of the course. Thank you Mr Pratson, Thank you Duke University, and Thank you Coursera.
It was simply excellent! Very clear and comprehensive. Really gave a good overview of the oil and gas sector. The professor's voice was also very clear. He was well spoken. I learned a lot. Thank you!

Good presentation.Happy to get a lecture from Prof. Lincoln Pratson
Very interesting. This course offer an useful overview of Oil & Gas industry, covering all relevant aspects.Even the Coursera platform support wonderfully videos and lessons.Emanuele Volterra
GREAT COURSE i ever learned across domains. This is a best course for non-OIL/GAS professionals because this course truly convert them into domain expertise upon successful completion. Syllabi is so rich and in-depth which comprises of all areas of strength and weakness / risk around upstream, midstream and downstream. And, the demand supply dynamics and pricing impact across geographies etc., are insightful. Professor is kind enough to share his knowledge generously and his passion towards lecturing this subject is creating wow effect. I felt fulfilled now.
From this course I have learn much more information regarding the drilling sites, production , reservoir contents and more specially Economic price rise and fall in this industry. I thank to Coursera
Thank you for organizing such an excellent course which is essential for a young ambitious students who want to build their career in this industry
An exceptionally well-taught course.
I was very happy with this course. Gave me a good insight into the business side of things in O&G. Strongly recommended if you want to find out a little bit about O&G and are new to the industry.
Excellent course, especially for people practicing in the oil and gas industry. Gives you a broader view of various factors that affect operations in the industry. I highly recommend the course.
The Course gives really a good insight about oil and gas operations and markets, the  content is sincerely appreciable the way it covers every aspects.
This course is very helpful to gain knowledge regards to oil and gas. The charts and contents they have made are in good series.
This course contains outstanding knowledge of petroleum industry. As a Metallurgist, the content is so advantageous for me.
best course for petroleum and gas engineering student. i learn a lot of things which i haven't learnt at university
Good course for basic knowledge of Oil and Gas Industry, excellent approach for online courses.
This course gave me a good overview of Oil and Gas industry. Its market and operations.
It was a great learning and the insights of the oil and gas industry.
a very interesting topic covered in a very precise and accurate way
Quite interesting. A good introduction to the subject.
Interesting course about oil and gas industry
Great course, fare better then expectations!
Good overview, very informative content
Great course, I learned a lot
great Oil an gas learning!
First of all, I
would like to thank Duke University for providing the course and the coursera
platform. Thank you.Since I liked the
Oil & Gas industry, I did mine engineering, because here in Mozambique
there are no universities that can teach petroleum engineering.I really appreciate
the classes, as I was able to learn a lot about the Oil & Gas sector. I
already have many answers for the exploration and production of Oil & Gas,
I learned a lot about processing and refining, as well as transportation. But
what caught my attention the most was the Oil & Gas market, it is amazing
how oil is related to a country's economy, how a large producer of Oil &
Gas can change the price of the final product.I already had
notions about how advances in technologies could change the world, but seeing
how the Oil & Gas sector has changed was impressive.I already knew that
oil and natural gas are non-renewable resources, however, getting to know that
with the reduction of the cost of extraction and the increase in the sale
price, new reserves can be explored, was something very interesting.Thank you so much
for learning.Sorry for my English
For those already in the industry, it gives immense detail of what the Oil & Gas industry is all about and makes decision making more objective as a non-Geoscientist/Engineer. I learned more about Oil prospecting and the geology of various oil reservoir and how it affects the economic reserves of a business. Also learnt how oil and gas mining can be effectively done to enable profitable exploitation before a well is considered uneconomical or plugged. Different pricing structures and how prices vary in the world was also another important knowledge gained in this Course. For those who are new to the Oil & Gas industry, this is a must-attend course, it prepares you for the challenges ahead. For those already in the industry, it allows comprehension of the industry easier and makes decision making more objective as a non-Geoscientist/Engineer
The course is really build well to provide the complete overview on Oil and Gas Industry and operations and is very useful to know how the Oil and Gas prices are currently being controlled. I would recommend this course for every one to go through so that they can understand importance of power industry in the current situation which the world is facing currently considering pandemic Covid 19 situation. This course will help even for all the government and corporate leaders to   understand how they should manage their existing reserves of oil and gas economically to safeguard the life of the current living and will make them to plan better for future lives.
Oil and gas industry operation ..This is very interesting course..because i'm a petroleum engineering enthusiast...This course helped a lot to explore about the oil and  gas industry operations like-Exploration,production, processing and refining and lastly transport...It gave me knowledge about  how the crude oil extracted from the oceans and the further process...I will say its a great opportunity to learn with such  good tutors of Reputed institutions like one DUKE UNIVERSITY...I  will say don't miss the opportunity to learn this course..Best wishes! Ahead..
this course was very helpful for me to understand the basic knowledge about the generation , migration of petroleum ,the petroleum system , present situation about oil and gas in the world of different region ,  prices of oil and gas , oil and gas reserves , drilling technique , processing of oil and gas , Gasoline and diesel importance .as a student of geological sciences , all the information i have learnt in this course was helpful for me to further learning about petroleum industries which will aid more skill for working in the future.
I found the course excellent. Its content and flow of information is very knowledgeable. This course provides valuable insights into highly complex oil gas sector integrated operations and marketing, learning on entire value chain from exploration, evaluation, production through refining, transport and markets in the exact way as the business operates.   My special thanks to Lincoln F. Pratson from  Duke University for his dedicated teaching and making us learn fine points of the hydrocarbon sector operations & markets.
Although is a short course, is an excellent beginning to the oil and gas industry process, with less than 5 minutes per video, the professor explains all the concepts in an easy way, and the quizzes help to reinforce the learned concepts. With this course you can learn how the hydrocarbons are extracted from the reservoir, which characteristics defines the price of oil, natural gas and gasoline, which products are derived from petrol and the effect of crisis in one of the most profitable industry of the world.
Many thanks to Duke University and Professor Pratson for such an interesting course! It was intensive and productive for me and fullfiled all my expectations. So this course gives a student broad pattern of international oil and gas markets, supported by statistical meters. What is more it gives a broad description of oil and gas production and refinery without deeping in much chemistry and physics. The final project is also very interesting and would be a nice attachment to a person's portfolio.
In my opinion the course was well developed because it is an overview about what is and means the oil and gas industry from the main characteristics of the petroleum, its extraction until the comecialization but at the same time the course had enough time to talk about the legal and economical structure of an oil and gas company. 
In a few word, this is a pretty well introductory course in this area. Now, it is importan create another course more specific. 

Thanks to educate and my best regards.
Excellent coverage of the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry. The course covers both the technological and the commercial aspects related to oil and gas. Additionally, the course also provide an overview of the future prospects of the oil and gas industry. The peer review assignment is one of its kind as it involves a extensive research about the company and while reviewing your peers work you get information about a lot of oil and gas companies spread across different geographies.
Most valuable knowledge about Oil and Gas Industry throughout the series from bottom to top of the industry,As a worker in Oil and Gas firm which is really enjoyable to me all the sections and I have taken this opportunity as as valuable asset which attained in this Covid-19 era,.I here express my sincere gratitude to the Coursera, Farook College, Duke University , Mr.lincoln Pratson (The lecturer)  and my dear friend Mr.Mohammed Mubarak who have invited me to join for this course.
As a fresh chemical and biochemical engineer looking for jobs or pursuing my graduate degree, I found this course insightful as it provided an overview of the entire gas operations in addition to markets. I concluded that crude oil processing or unconventional resources are possible fields of interest. The videos were concise, well explained and supported with graphs and visits to sights or showcasing of shale rocks. I enjoyed this course and finished it in less than a week!
Overall, The course is very informative and its the best time, when we can explore the insights we gained from the course. On looking towards the current scenario of the oil and gas market, as we all know the market has hit its lowest. This course helped me better understand the situation of the oil prices downfall.I recommend the people interested to learn about the oil and gas industry to take the course and broaden their perspective towards the oil and gas industry.
The oil and gas industry operations and markets were very effective course which covers most of the point used In the industry and also
give the bright explanation about the process of the operation and you can
easily understand the upstream and downstream, the marketing of the oil and
gas, at the end this course add to me the knowledge and highly recommended it is
powerful topic if you want to complete the image of the oil and gas industry. 

Sincerely, 
Emad N Masri
Great course with excellent experience. I already have a graduate diploma in Oil & Gas Management and this course has added some knowledge in the oil & Gas market to my industry and management knowledge.I will recommend this course for anybody without the industry knowledge and to anybody who wants refresh his/her thoughts in the industry operation and how the oil and gas market are controlled by different factors, location and government policies and taxes.Thank you.
I think the course offers a very concise and helpful foundation for the knowledge of the oil and gas industry. The teaching method and platform was something I appreciated most, because of its flexibility and, in the meantime, its discipline in terms of fundamentals of the domain. While progreesing with the course readings, I was happy to see I was able to maintain a good level of conversation with professionals from the oil and gas industry. Gook luck, to all of you!
This course is fantastic.Before starting this course i was having professional experience in the field of operation and market in Mari petroleum company limited but after the completion of this course i am sure about myself that i am having some more insight of the oil and gas and can lead the company to have good rank in market share.Once again this course is an excitement too  for  me and i will further want to have much more courses on coursera.
I came into the program with no knowledge about the course. But, i was confident i could make something great out of it. At the end, the program exceeded my expectations, i was able to learn more and acquire knowledge around Oil and Gas Industry Operations and Markets. I recommend this to anyone whose looking at adding up to what they have studied. Today, I'm in a great position to add my voice to the growing concerns and the growth of Oil and Gas.
Very interesting course concisely covers the most relevant information about the oil and gas business for my purposes. I am an Inside Sales Engineer involved in market identification, prospecting, and development of new business. My education is in Chemical Engineering and I work for a manufacturer of electric actuators for operating control valves and other field devices in manufacturing industries. Thanks! Highly recommended to my colleagues.
I have been trying different sources to gain insight into the Oil and Gas Industry. The fall of WTI crude price below zero amidst the Covid-19 crisis and Oil war confused me. This course by Mr Pratson covers complete information on this industry from exploration to market. The course best explains how the price changes and what are the driving parameters. The best thing about this course is that it covers more information in less time.
An excellent course! Each section is very well structured and contains all the necessary details and information needed for a strong all-around understanding. Professor Pratson is an excellent educator and speaker. The course is very easy to understand and all the materials are presented in a clear and practical manner. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to quickly grasp all the Oil & Gas basics.
I would like to thank Professor Lincoln Pratson, from Duke University, for sharing part of his experience, teaching a lot about "Oil and Gas Industry: Operations and Market". It was two long and enjoyable weeks learning more (and sharing my point of view) about the energy industry. It is always a great pleasure for me to be aware of the changes and trends of the global market. Hope to learn more from you soon.
This course sets the tone for knowing essentials of Oil and Gas. Its biggest advantage is that it provides a structured knowledge so that we know what to know about the industry. I would strongly recommend to anyone who has interest in knowing essentials of oil and gas. Though, I would recommend that the course should have more inputs about markets like China and India and some policy coverage.
I have enjoyed this course immensely, thought due to some personal issues I didn't quite get to put the amount of time into it that I had hoped to. I found it very enlightening regardless and believe it has given me a better understanding of the environment which I work around. I greatly appreciate our professor, Coursera, and Duke University for having put this together and made this possible.
What is Oil & Gas and how does the industry vital to the economic well being of a country function?  This course provides an in depth understanding of the market and its operations.
