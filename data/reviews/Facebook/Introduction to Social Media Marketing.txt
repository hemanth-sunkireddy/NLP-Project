Maybe I'm judging it too harshly, because it IS targeted to beginners. I found it overly simplistic. In the end, I didn't bother watching the videos because the assignments could be easily done in under 5 minutes without watching the content. I found the second week in particular very redundant. Most people already know about Facebook, Instagram, etc. It was nothing new. Same for the final week. I honestly didn't bother watching the videos at all and simply took the test, which I had 100% success at, because it was that easy.I'd personally only take this course for the certificate that it gives. It doesn't have much value beyond that.
Informative! Live examples help us to understand how marketer work around the social media.
Particularly enjoy the section on Social Media Landscapes!
Great!
