Although the material may be helpful, it felt patronising. Once I completed and submitted the videos and quizzes it wasn't marking them as completed and I had to basically wait until the course told me it was overdue and asked me to reset my deadlines. Then I had to re-do the whole course over again for it to be marked as complete
I took the Coursera program with Prof Steve Joordens Managing your Mental Health during COVID19. I completed the course with a 93.2% grade. I have still NOT received from you a copy of my certificate which I paid for. Please provide thatAll the Best,Mary-Jo Fetterly www.mary-jo.com604 754-4488
InferiorI went through Week 1 - this instructor has NOTHING to offer educated mental health professionals / anyone - with any background in psychology.This course is a waste of time - and I have no interest to pursue.
This course is very beneficial to control the mental health during this quarantine life.it helps to enhance interest to try new things.Thank you so much for giving such a great guidance as well as best medium.
Dear Concern,I have completed the course a few days before. But didn‚Äôt receive the certificate yet. Please issue my certificate as soon as possible. Thanks!
I never got my certificate.  I completed all 4 weeks with the quizzes and nothing.  It still shows that the course is in progress.
i completed the course long back but i have not received certificates and it is showing reset guidelines which is not accessible
Though I have completed the course, I haven't received my certificate. Even the reset my deadlines is not working.
It is very helpful to reduce anxiety and fear about our new disease covid19
good course but no certificate on completion
Finished the course days in progress
This coures if very usefull
Where‚Äôs my certificate?
Very bad experience
In the very use full mind control
It was really informative.
This course could have been kept condensed. It would also have benefited if more psychological and sociological terms have been added to make it more informative and scholarly. I felt that basic ideas were introduced in a round about way instead of presenting them in a precise way. The topic is of course, relevant for the current issues we are facing.
I think this course would have been more helpful and relevant for someone at the beginning of Covid-19. At this point, a lot of the suggestions seem redundant, however the Prof did a great job, and for someone who is new to self care/managing their anxiety and mental health this course would be useful.
This course was very good to me because it help me tremendously during this time of pandemic. It taught me how to manage my anxiety which is something I needed to learn at the moment.
good course for betterment of individual reducing anxiety
I learnt a lot from this course, thank you Coursera üòä
It's really effective in this situation
The course is excellent
Didn't get certificate
need for the hour
Wonderful short course , learned alot.
I discovered this course at a time when I am going through so much mental health issues and the COVID-19 situation even made matters worse. I learned a lot of important points from this course that I am going to put into practice to help me get through this situation. I also discovered that mental health is one underrated aspect of life in some parts of the world (especially in my country), but it is a real issue and people are going through so much out there and opt to suffer in silence. This course somehow made me interested to look into the psychology field in the future.
i am glad that doing this course for controlling Anxiety during this days where we don't have any work.now a days i am spending time with my daughter (5Yrs) she taught's me so much we both are playing in home watching cartoons, having lunch dinner and every thing, i am happy that at present but there is problem in that our job security we are doing work  from home but on finacial case  we are little worry. try to add those how can we strengthen our strength.   thank you.
Down to earth and easy to understand, practical suggestions with enough discussion of psychological research to give background and foundation.  I really enjoyed the presentation and the ideas given to help people and families through this unprecedented (in my lifetime) experience.  It would be really cool to have some suggestions on how to deal with people who are not following social distancing or mask mandates as a part of this course, or as a follow up.
This is a course for those looking for a good overview of how psychological concepts could be applied to how we can react functionally during this pandemic. It does not, however, add anything new for those who are already well-versed in psychology. It might, in fact, be somewhat disappointing for people who have already read a lot of studies on managing anxiety. Nevertheless, it is a good refresher and reminder of what we can do to manage our anxieties.
I found the course very organized content-wise. It was a good choice for not including too many technical details as the course is meant to be for everyone. But I would like to see more lectures on how to control our mind and behaviour with more correlation to human psychology.Overall, the course was enjoying and it definitely helped me. I had the course to look forward to while starting my day. More lectures with more content would be really helpful.
Hi! Prof. Steve Joordens your course was extremely helpful to me and made me realize how important it is to be healthy mentally and have an effective mind control, it made kinda prepared to face my anxiety and depression with the guided relaxation audio that you shared in this course! grateful for your knowledge sharing & Also a big appreciation to the front line health workers! thank you coursera for providing us with this course!
This is very timely for COVID-19 and the our lives in general. A good balance of theory and practice to get people to understand enough of brain ‚Äúwiring‚Äù and things to DO. It removes the feeling of trying to become movers and shakers of the world, and to realize to physically distancing and strengthening social connections is a personal and civic duty. Thank you!
This was a really insightful course. It gave me a lot of takeaways and reminded me of the little things that I could do as an individual although we are in this pandemic. I loved the concept that it is not meant to be a period of social distancing but physical distancing with connection to people via virtual platforms on a physical and emotional level.
This course is a great exercise in self-reflection and has amazing suggestions for those struggling with circumstances created in response to COVID-19. The course is developed with neuro-typical people in mind and is quite short, preventing it from thoroughly exploring how some of the concepts could be applied for neuro-diverse individuals.
Thanks for the valuable information, I would like to ask for further references to be added at the end of every lecture.. this may help us to gain more information about anxiety, depression and so on. Another point, the certificate is not related to  Tornoto University! What is written is only coursera!!!
I found the presenter's style very compassionate. I found the topics and offered methodology very effective, simple and honest. My only recommendation would be perhaps a little bit shorter presentations and less repetitions. Thank you, all the best and stay well!
I like the charisma and simplicity of the author of the course. The course is very short, for sure you can generate other additional videos to cover other additional strategies. Congratulations for your generosity and desire to help others.
Thank you for helping me understand how to let go of things I can't control to reduce stress/anxiety through breathing, pausing, physical social distancing, connecting verbally with positive people and re-calibrating essentially. Thank you!
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise despite having a very simple gadget. I agree with you that it is the message and teachings that are more important. Keep up the good work and good intentions of helping others. God bless.
The course is very effective in a pandemic situation like corona virus, and it help us to know circumstances and work according to the situation. In such scary situation how we should keep our mind stable can understand from this course
Takes into consideration the influence of COVID on the mental health of people, around the globe. Along with providing information and techniques that are not only relevant during this pandemic, about also helpful when this is all over.
Enjoyed the course, very useful and lucid presentation.  However had to take the course twice to get the certificate. made some enrollment mistake in my first attempt.  hence even after completing it, could not get the certificate
This course was extremely interesting and I¬¥ve learned a lot of useful things. Sometimes, in my point of view, content was repeated and summerized too often, but in general I am very glad I assisted that course. Thank you so much!
THIS COURSE IS VERY NIFTY IN THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC SITUATION. I RECOMMEND EVERY ONE TO TAKE UP THIS COURSE BUT ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO FEELS VERY ARDUOUS TO CONTROL THERE  MIND DURING ISOLATION.
This course was well paced and the Instructor is very knowledgeable and practical. His suggestions for activities to do during this time was helpful as well. I may actually try Karaoke.
It was an amazing experience to learn and inculcate some behaviour changes in to slef development in this time of crisis. Thankyou to the experts and the instructor and the proffesor
The methods and things taken in this course are not only realted to COVID 19 crisis but also can be used for all other things happening in life. Course was very helpful in general.
A Very nicely put together course that definitely highlights what measures are needed to be taken by one during this pandemic and how one can take care of their mental health.
During this COVID-19 period, having this course is such a blessing. From this type, of course, any student or any person can keep him/her fit both mentally & physically.
Short, clear and useful information. And some really practical tips how to manage yourself in this period, and how to help yourself by helping others. Great! Thank you!
It was a good course, with simple and easily understandeable concepts. For me most of the information provided through the course was repetitive with few new learnings.

Proved to be very helpful and useful during this difficult scenario and surely helped me to improvise my mental health during this condition.
This is a really helpful course not just for me but also for my students/counselees. Would really love to share what I learned here to them.
I enjoy every lesson in every chapter and videos. What he says is true and in reality we must watch ourselves both physically and mentally.

During this time where the whole world is going trough a very rough time,it is very imp for the people to take care of their mental health and thanks to this course!It has taught me lot many things.
The course is very helpful and I learned a lot! Professor Joordens explained each topic very well and relates it to simple scenarios that helped me understand the context more. Thank you very much!
Great course. This course enabled me to intensively understand psychological effects concerning COVID -19. It helped me to enhance my professional understanding
exceptional. Timely action for a real problem by Prof Joordens.Thank you for this great course. waitng for the depression course he mentioned
I very much enjoyed the organic aspect of the content as well as the delivery method and moderator. Bravo!
Dr.Steve has this casual way of approach that makes us very comfortable. Its like we have known him before.This course is too good. Why is this course not given a certificate upgrade option?
Great learning and skills developed during these challenging times.
This course is a great way to learn about how our minds work during this pandemics. The thing I liked the most is the style of the professor - he is so genuine, straightforward, funny sometimes and it's just pleasant to listen to him. It's making you feel like you're listening to a friend who is not only providing you with information, but is showing empathy and kindness which reaches you as an individual and not just a member of the audience. The content offers a realistic perspective of what is going out in our minds in this period, being in physical isolation, so I strongly recommend it. It's not very often to reach such a good content these days, making an overview of what is happening and how we could cope with it. Thanks to the professor for being available to put this material together! I recommended it to family, friends, the people at work (I'm doing remote work during this period). It took me less than 4h to complete and it was clearly time well spent.
I found this course to be very helpful. Bravo! Prof....
I have only finished Week 1, but I feel comfortable rating this course 5-stars! Prof. Joordens presents this information in a calm, digestible, engaging manner. I would argue this isn't merely a course for COVID-19, but one that develops lifelong skills (as Prof. Joordens mentions in his overview). As someone who struggles with anxiety, the way Prof. Joordens has explained why anxiety happens, how to mitigate it, and how to train my mind to relaxation is invaluable. Thank you for creating this course! Looking forward to Week 2!
Thanks a lot for the knowledge about mental health and the tools to help us go through these times of physical distancing. I really enjoyed it.
Simple, easy to understand and offered effective strategies for those having mild anxiety. Thank you and hope to see you again !!
Mind Control: Managing Your Mental Health During COVID-19, was an absolutely fantastic course.  Wow! I did the entire course in the 3 hour duration as I was eager to learn all at once.  Professor, Steve Joordens was wonderful and made the course such an enjoyable one. Thank you, Professor. The course was evenly paced and easy to understand. I loved the guided relaxation and have been practicing it several times a day and seeing immediate benefits. This was my very first course by Course Era and I am inspired to take more courses and especially ones taught by this Professor. Thank you so much!
Lovely course that gives you insight into how anxiety, fear and depression relates to one another. Great guidelines on how to effectively manage metal health during this time as well as other stressful situations.
This course is very help me and show how can I manage my mind during this hard time. I really love the way that Prof. show us how easy to be relax! Thank you very much for this amazing course.
Excellent course. Very useful for these times of confinement. Makes you feel less alone and gives you the tools necessary to deal with anxiety. Professor Steve Joordens has managed to summarize in this short course just everything you need to better manage all the sensations and confusion we are all sharing right now. Very generous and emphatic on his part to have shared all this knowledge with us.
Nicely done with a lot of great information put in relatively easy-to-understand terms.  It is very well laid out.  I would imagine this could help a lot of people as they struggle with the current situation.  I also hope that it facilitates the idea that we are in this together and that focusing on each other a little more will get us through this.  Thanks for this.
Great help for everyone. Physical distancing are very important and we must strengthen our social connection.
Professor Steve Joordens of the University of Toronto and his online course Mind Control: Managing Your Mental Health During COVID-19 delivered by Coursera are excellent and outstanding.  He taught us learners to control our anxiety, to manage our environment and avoid isolation, and to craft each of our days so that we have productive times and relaxation times.  I downloaded the Guided Relaxation Audio by Professor Steve Joordens, and this is something that will be useful to me daily.  I took Professor Steve Joordens' online Introduction to Psychology course delivered by Coursera in the year 2015, which I thought was excellent and outstanding as well, and in this year 2020 course he went beyond the material from the year 2015 and gave excellent new insights.  I give Professor Steve Joordens and his Mind Control: Managing Your Mental Health During COVID-19 online course my very highest recommendation!!
I loved every bit of it! Understanding what is going on with my mind and body really puts me in a better place. Working on listening to the Anxiety Relaxation Audio every day and it works; makes me energetic when I am low, to get up and get my shit done. Thank you so much for the course, it's much required during this time.I hope everyone is doing okay!
Steve, you are very smart, kind sounding and on point. For such a last minute course, your content has zero bla bla; everything, whether relevant to me or not, was excellently spoken and it did cover possibily most people's needs. Thank you for sharing freely your excellent teaching skills and knowledge! Best, Jhonatan
So grateful that a course like this exists.  I found the information that was presented easy to understand and in such a way that small changes to my daily routine seem manageable.  Thank you very much!
The course is very insightful.  The topics were carefully and simply taught by Prof. Joordens.  It's easy to understand and has helped a lot in understanding how our minds work esp during this pandemic.
Loved it! Some worthy lessons for even the post-Covid world. Thank you, Steve, for a fantastic set of videos!
A good course to take for tips in keeping ourselves calm and preoccupied during these trying times
It is an wonderful initiative by the Professsor.
Again, I enjoyed the Professors calm way of passing on important knowledge from his vast catalog of knowledge to the ordinary student, without it becoming high-browed or too low-key. It was again in a quiet and calm dialogue-like manner, that one video took the next and wupti so that the samples could be crossed without any problems - and the content was fine tuned. I would have liked to pay for the course and get a little proof, but it's probably just me :-)Thanks again.Henrik
This course was very beneficial to me because as a technical parson of others field I have learned a lot of things which are very much important for all in there pendemic as I think.. thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
The course was very well planned and structured. It helped me to understand the anxiety issues i was earlier dealing with myself and took me back to the right track of knowledge. Thankyou!! :)
Thank you sir, for your humbleness of feeling for teach us in good way. I have learned about how to control my mind or any distraction. Thank for giving this great platform to us !!!
Very informative course. I found the guidance really helpful, and I suggest this course to everyone who is trying to maintain balance in his life during this adverse time.
Dr. Joordens takes a relaxed approach to presenting some fundamental background on anxiety and taking control, particularly during these stressful times of COVID-19.
I enjoyed this course, the content and quizzes easy to understand and explained in plain language.  Prof. Joordens provided useful tips and strategies for managing mental health during this challenging time. For future content, perhaps include more psychological theory on anxiety responses and mental health might be useful, as well as short assignments/reflection pieces. Overall, enjoyable and worth taking, thank you!
I love this course. The way things are explained is really enough for every learner to be more interested and keep learning. I also love how Prof. Steve shares his practical recommendations in dealing with anxiety and the likes. Hope to see more courses like this. Thank you for this learning opportunity!
Videos well done, short and informativeHelpful strategies, especially the jedi mind controlIt works because I have been using for several years before taking this course. It is great to see this idea reinforced with easy to follow steps
This course is very interesting and informative one. Any body can take this course within short duration. Surely this course is very useful to everyone.Thank you cordinator and instrucor
the professor successfully conveyed his point accross .and frankly speaking i didnt expect the class to be so fun,but i was surprised to find myself enjoy learning with the professor .
The Course is timely and useful. Lessons are direct, understandable and relevant.However, i have already completed the course since yesterday but the status remains  ‚Äúin progress‚Äù
NIcely done sir. It was addictive. I have learnt a lot of theory but this was more like theroy into practical, how can we practically deal with things, which I loved the most.
Very informative and helpful now that we are facing this pandemic.. It helps in our emotional outlook and learned that social interaction is important at this time of crisis
It's good course especially since many of us got so worried about our mental health in this pandemic situation.
This course is very much useful for me as I'm Very much nervous on Every situation
This is my first course on coursera and I really liked it
It's help how to live and oppos the corona virus
Professor Joorden, your course has been tremendously enlightening. I am pleased to see the  emphasis placed on empathy, Also, to see the positive side of our changed situation, such as quality time with family, walks in nature, and connecting on an emotional level with loved ones. The recommendation of being in touch with the elderly lonely souls too is highly commendable. I wish your course had a website that in fact allowed us to daily connect with homes to give solace, comfort and love to those most in danger from the virus, given their age and illnesses. I for one would daily spend some time chatting through zoom or whatever, learn its workings, and take such an endeavour very seriously, if the platform existed. No other place better than your course. Thank you for your immensely humane ways, sharing them with us, your purpose in life has brought purpose to us as well..  If I may say so, your email was covered by your image in the last lecture.... Wishing you the best, and your wife and doggie.... Laila Khan: lkhan.cnsa@gmail.comPS: I retook the whole course just now, as I was informed I needed to complete it. If I recall, when I took it last, there were no quizzes.... it was a pleasure returning to it, and I shall do so again  to better absorb all the good sense recommended here...
What a wonderful professor and course.  I recommend this course.  It is put together with care and concern, backed by a solid foundation of multiple principles of self-awareness and self-care pointers.  Anyone who struggles with the care of their workday, their family, their own mental attitude in the harsh demands of a virus pandemic in the middle of a city (or anywhere for that matter!)   will find this a breath of fresh air:  serves you a palette of common sense, solid facts, and gentle prods to get your house in order - Trains you to relax yourself so you can be your best for yourself, your work, your family, your community.  Everything is covered.  Not a stone is unturned.  Professor Steve J is the BEST. This is a course that will stay on your mind and you will retain the tools (once learned) for life. Thank you, Professor Steve J.             -      Student Spring/Summer 2020, Sacramento CA
Instructor: Dr. Steve Joordens was beyond wonderful at teaching this class.  Not anyone can do it.  I learned a great deal and have reduced my anxiety by using the techniques we were taught.Dr. Joordens did such a great job teaching this class.  His calm, caring attitude helped a great deal.  Techniques for surviving a pandemic include: reducing stimuli - such as overusing social media can be beneficial, planning our day helps us to remember to use our techniques such as meditation and exercise to make us feel more motivated and healthy,  and remembering to social distance etc. but also to make sure we have contact with other people to help us feel better mentally - we can use the telephone to have conversations with people who are alone or to call a friend and ask how they are doing.  This class was wonderful and anyone would benefit from it.
I have given 5 stars to this amazing course because it helped me to understand my mental state in the COVID-19 period. This course boosted my confidence to step ahead in my life. Due to social isolation, I was depressed and anxious. I had lost my confidence. But this course guided me very well to bounce back. I learnt some of the valuable tips from this course which are healthy food which will nourish my mind. Truly helpful course for anyone how wants to develop their mental strength. Videos were too simple to understand. Course instructor Steve Joordens explaining technique is mindblowing. He can teach anybody. Hat's off to his teaching. Thanks, Steve for your immense guidance. I am very much happy to complete this course.
This course is something really something everyone should do not just during this lockdown but at any point of time, the content of this course helps one to realize certain things about the mental health and also it really helped me come out of the anxiety that I have not due to COVID but some personal things. This short and sweet course really helped me get out of it. I'd like to thank the professor for his time to make this course and surely this is bringing a positive change for people like me. I strongly recommend this course for anyone and everyone out there and I believe that the things that you are going to learn out of this course are going to help you somewhere in your life if not today.
Brilliant BasicsI found this course very relevant, easy to follow and understand.  I have done a few readings about this subject so I was familiar with most of what he brought to the table and completed this before 4 weeks; but still he did it brilliantly. Prof. Joordens had a beautiful natural way of talking and very personal approach. He was not typically lecturing or dominating - very light hearted with simple, basic life examples and a little old school but I appreciated it and felt I could relate, trust and have confidence in his approach. He was very respectful and did not use slang or negative insinuations. His final dedication to all the health workers worldwide was touching!
This really is a great course, guides you subtly through societal demographics, factors that influence you, overthinking, holding on to singular thoughts which negatively increase anxiousness due to over consumption of information and how to deal with these things by counter acting, balancing and teaching ourselves to practice mental and physical relaxation techniques also by distracting thoughts are the key features and the main aim of this course, it doesn't only help you through times like these but also in regular day to day life post the current scenario (physical isolation from social beings due to Corona Virus).
The lectures provide very practical tips to help us manage the psychological state in the health pandemic of the century! I like the Professor's friendly disposition used in his videos. Instead of speaking with us like a formal authority to students, his tone and facial expressions certainly show that he genuinely cares for all of us. ;)A Professor who truly practises what he preaches about building social connections which are so vital during this looming mental health epidemic that experts have been talking about. Go for this course; you will not regret learning useful skills that can benefit us for life! :)
During this pandemic, most of the people are suffering from the psychological issues or may be some kind of depression. This lecture on "Mind Control: Managing your mental health during COVID-19" can help a lot to identify your actual issues and there are many ways which are described here so that we can also find some kind of escape to deal with this. There are so many interesting ways such as painting, singing, dancing and many more to indulge  your mind into different kind of activities so that we can take care of our mental health because mind is also the art of our body and also needed to treat well.
Excellent course! From this course I am taking away a lot of helpful information and points how to better deal with the anxiety COVUD-19 has brought into my life and the life of everyone around me. It made me understand better why I/others feel so extremely stressed and what options there are to deal with the situation in order to stay healthy. Steve even opened my eyes that I/everyone can get something positive out of this extrem situation. Thank you! What an excellent class and teacher!  I can definitely recommend this course and will  continue using COURSERA for my personal growth. Thank you!
The course was structured very well. The videos had the right amount of content - they were neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. Complex concepts are explained in a simple manner and Psychology is brought into the picture again and again. This lends depth to the content and the learner feels like they're truly getting something out of the course. The knowledge gained is applicable to real life and can be done in a few simple steps and this is perhaps the biggest plus point. All in all, it was an extremely interesting few hours and I'd definitely tune in if there's more!
I found this course to be very helpful with respect to acknowledging what one may to feeling during this pandemic, to the whys one may be feeling the way they are to how one can can gain some feelings of control through simple specific daily actions. As the parent of a teenager heading off to university studies this September, I really appreciated the concise delivery of relevant material that is easily explained to others (ie. that teenager). I found this course, the manner it was delivered and the take aways very positive, helpful and comforting. Thank you Professor!
I am so glad to take up this course. This is very much relevant in our present situation and also this will stay with me all along since these concepts and practices are also applicable in dealing with other factors causing us anxiety, not just this ongoing pandemic. Professor Steve Joordens effectively shared with us his knowledge and delivered a comprehensive understanding on how our mind works and shared us how we can control negative thoughts. This is very much helpful in many ways. Thank you Professor Joordens, University of Toronto, and the whole Coursera Team.
Enrolling on this course was the best thing I did in this time. It helped me learn the ways we can manage our anxiety. This course also taught me how important it is to take care of our mental health and how we can do that simply by focusing on little but important things and doing our everyday habitual chores more purposefully. The instructor was just Amazing, Fantastic, Great!!! If I could, I would give him more than 5 stars for his wonderful effort to make this course so enjoyable as well as informative in a way that everybody can remember.
This course really helped me understand feelings and behaviors that have arisen in me and those close to me in the wake of the pandemic. It has also given me ideas and tools to control the anxiety that generates so much uncertainty, without a doubt isolating myself was not helping me so I have chosen to strengthen my friendships virtually and from a distance, but without a doubt the power of the feel identified and in society. Tanks SteveP.D. I keep practicing and I am more and more aware of when I need to regain my state of relaxation
I really like this short course because it is something that most of us needed during these times. What I like most about the topic is that it truly helps me in determining and managing what triggers my mental problems. One way to manage our mental health is by teaching our mind and body how to relax and what relaxation feels like; hence the guided relaxation. Trying out the guided relatxation activity really puts my body into ease and I might try to make it a habit along the way to lessen my anxiety even after this pandemic.
Mind control: managing your mental health during COVID 19 ,was an absolutely fantastic course. Wow! I did the entire course in the 3hours duration as i was eager to learn all at once, professor. The course was eventy paced and easy to understand.  I loved the guided relaxation and have been practicing it severals time a day and seeing immediate benefits this was my every first course by course.  Earned I am inspired to take more courses and especially ones though by this professor,thank u so much.

this was a very helpful and skill asserting course that assisted me in being able to deal with the anxiety and depression caused by the pandemic , it really opened up ways to ensure i be able to manage isolation as well as helping those who are lonely and not social connected ..the idea is to connect, re-invest and re connect with people socially dispite  physical distancing we are facing and making better things of the free  time we have in hand and also keeping healthier and better .
The time i take to complete a week's task like watching the lists of videos and then solving those tricky problems to get the solution of the assignments, In the mean time I eventually completed this course on Coursera. This course is truly motivating at times and situations like this. I would really like to appreciate the initiative of the course instructor and salute to all the frontline worker out there working day and night for safety from this human malware.
I found this course really interesting and useful. I gratefully appreciate the efforts taken by Prof. Steve Joordens, and he did his best. His session was very interesting. Many around the world suffer from anxiety and depression, with a majority committing suicide. In that context, this topic seems extremely relevant, so that I can also help myself and others who are suffering from the same. Thank you to the entire team of Coursera and SNM Training College.
This 'course' is FANTASTIC. Short, sweet, to the point, chock full of very doable tips for managing anxiety, and 'putting together' a plan/approach for getting through, in positive, self affirming ways, this current situation we're all dealing with. Mr. Joordans is an empathetic, funny, and warm teacher. This is a great course...and let's you jump right in and grab some easy, helpful 'coping' skills. Thank YOU, Mr. Joordans for putting this course together!
I love the course because aside from it's timely, it is very helpful to me and I think to all learners because all of us need to manage our mental health in order to control our decisions, emotions and interactions towards everyone.  I look forward to share this learning to my colleagues at work so that they may also experience the positive impact of controlling one's mind during this trying times.  Thank you for the great learning opportunity.
It was a great course for me to handle better with the situation we are all experiencing. I wish I had taken the course earlier days of quarantine, but my university will be online for months. So I will spend more time at home to not spread the virus. And the things I learned from this course will help me, I'm sure. Our teacher was excellent and I felt really comfortable while watching the videos and trying to understand. Thank you all!
It was a great experience for me. Currently, we face a very hard situation, and it all new to us. I didn't know what to do with new extra hours, anxiety, uncertainty for two months. This course gave me a better understanding of what I did in isolation that I normally do is okay and I can have control over my stress. It seems not a big deal but I needed this course. I think all people need to learn about mind control during tough times.
The instructor was very organized. I became more impressed as the course went on.people often wonder why I am not anxious. This course help me to understand myself better. Many of the suggestions I‚Äôve been doing for 50 years, such as singing as soon as I wake up, meditating on Scripture, exercising, dancing and trying to be nice to others and engaging them.Thank you very much. I‚Äôve already suggested other people to take the course.
I enjoyed the course. Really involved in watching the videos and clearly understood each and every point.  I always use the word physical distance from the beginning of COVID19 problem in India. This was emphasized by the speaker continuously. I was completely elated. I am insisting on my friends and students use the words physical distance and social connectivity. I also follow it. Simply fantastic course, I have taken.
An excellent course, I wish I had found it sooner! Professor Joordens passed on his knowledge extremely well, with just the right amount of humour, which I now know to be invaluable, thrown in. I have a longstanding interest in psychology, which has been enhanced by this course. Added to that, it will enable me to, hopefully help my work colleagues who are still on furlough, as well as those now back at work. Thank you.
I believe this is a valuable course to take especially in a time of such uncertainty. I find it important to go through courses like this before attempting to up-skill so that you go into other courses without any hindrances that might affect the learning process. Thank you Prof for breaking it down in a way that makes it easy to understand the topics and helped me to reflect on what my own mental health in this time.
I find this course very helpful. How I wish I took it sooner. I'm grateful to have been a part of this class and I look forward to more content regarding coping with anxiety and how to better connect with other people during this prolonged state of community quarantines at the time of COVID. I would like to extend my thanks to our lecturer, Prof. Joordens, to Coursera, and all my fellow learners. Keep safe, everyone!
This was much needed, practical advice at a time when even small things may aggravate the persistent feeling of anxiety about doing the right things well at work.Working in health care one is constantly concerned about the accuracy of putting on and taking off protective gear.I wish there were more lectures to follow.It adds to the structure of feeling like you are doing something which is also relaxing the mind.
This was an amazing course! The Professor was very understanding of the problems we face, everyday, and offered simple solutions that can be easily implemented for dealing with anxiety. He gave us hope and the fact that he placed great importance on building emotional connectivity suggests that he understands, truly, that in such grave and scary times, we need to support each other. I recommend it to everyone.
I am so grateful and happy to take this course. There is not only the basic information about how to manage our lives, but also the critical information about our bodies. Knowing all of them helps may help us to get rid of the feeling of depression or even being useless by just having control over our minds. In this course, the way of it is summarized as simple, short and funny as possible. So, thanks a lot!
Managing your mental health is a relevant and apt course at this time of Covid pandemic. The relaxation techniques and the right understanding of physical isolation with social connectivity is beautifully explained.  Reaching out to the vulnerable and learning new things will give a sense of fulfilment and purpose at this time of crisis.   The disease will pass and we will be stronger together as humanity.
The professor was very knowledgable, but not intimidating, so the material was really approachable. Obviously, the analysis of lockdown is very useful as it has continued into the summer, so it's still very timely. The science behind the course was fascinating and I'd love to take another course by this professor. I'll continue to refer to these materials throughout the lockdown for my own mental health.
i found this course very helpful.  i live with depression due to ptsd and many excellent points and suggestions were made in the program.  i am pretty introverted but do enjoy personal interaction. i've been missing this during this time.  steve made good suggestions about increasing interaction while still distancing and setting up structure so there is a sense and rhythm to the day.  thank you, steve!
This course really did give me new insights and knowledges related to psychology and how to deal with life when were in a middle of a pandemic.  Prof. Joordens did an excellent job explaining a psychological related topic that are not necessarily easy to understand by people that are not familiar with psychological terms.  Im impressed with how he managed to explain things in a simplest way.
Just wanted to take a moment to personally THANK Professor Joordens for putting together an informative course. Professor I appreciate your time and effort and am excited to put to use the information you provided. I enjoyed your teaching technique, you came across very compassionate and engaging.  I'm new to the online learning and look forward to checking out more courses! Many Thanks!!

This course is very good. It teaches us the meaning of relaxation and to be positive despite the test that we are facing now. He share with us few strategies to manage isolation by advising us to take a walk, doing some aerobic, spent accomplish what we like to do, example learn new skill, playing instrumental instrument, like guitar, or take up online courses that we like.
I really enjoyed the way Steve tied in what we're all experiencing in our world at the moment with how our bodies are responding both physiologically and psychologically. It really helps to put it all in context and see that we are built to respond in this way and once we know that we can work to push things back in our favour. We can learn to thrive through Covid-19!
This is great! thank you for this! I was wondering of different ways I can relax and avoid social distancing. I want to interact with my family and friends but do it safely. I love how the professor talked about it being physical distancing and not so much social distancing. Thank you for this course! Definitely changes your mindset on some things during COVID-19.
This course specially on mind control during COVID 19 was worth the take. The session was both informative and thought provoking. The topics about sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were intresting. I had now learned the trick to reduce stress and not to be anxious. To conclude the entire course was helpful. Looking forward for more of these sessions.
this is a nice and a needed course at these times, it was very helpful and gave a lot of insight at things. managing emotions is one of the very important things that has to in play at such times. how to deal with our daily growing anxiety and trigger relaxation in our body is important for us to know during these times. this was a very helpful course.thank you.
It was a highly informative course. It will be very helpful to someone who is dealing with mental health issues in this pandemic and also to someone who is willing to help others to overcome this tough times. Through this course I came across to some psychological terms and facts that I did not know before. The teaching method of the instructor was very good.
The lectures were all very succinct, insightful, and applicable. The lessons all have a scientific basis behind them, yet they are explained in such a way that you do not need extensive background knowledge in order to immediately apply them in your life. I am grateful that I took this course and will surely use what I learned as I cope with the pandemic.

This course helped me gain a broader perspective on how I can help myself and others out of anxiety and other psychological effects during this tough time. Overall enjoyed learning new things and hoping for more.Regards,Al Alisha Nijas
Professor Joordens has summed up effective ways of dealing with our anxieties in a very beautiful manner! Adding to the relevance, ease of these strategies, his voice is too soothing and calming to listen to and follow. I cannot wait to share these thoughts with my parents and better late than never, start dealing with our anxieties effectively!
Amazing! I was looking for something exactly like this! Simple, straight to the main ideas and, also, the Professor who gives the lectures looks like a very nice, calm and sweet person.It's really easy to keep up the pace with the activities and, besides, I find it really helpful to understand what we're going through right now. Again. amazing!

Wonderful course that gives abundance of knowledge about Covid-19 and how it affects us mentally. Please engage in this course it explores what choices we have to help in our journey doing this pandemic.  From the mind/body exercises to the scheduling of activities to keep us grounded and what physical/social isolation does to us.
I undertook this course because I have always prioritized 'Mental Health' as an individual and in times like these where we are clueless on how to deal with our anxiety and vulnerability this course has been a blessing in disguise. Special thanks to Steve Joordens for making and curating this course in a simple and crisp manner!
Teacher's opinions matched with my opinions that's makes me feel so good , I also say my family the same things. I just enjoyed to learn this course and feel free. Thank you for increasing my mental health in this covid-19 situation. Thank you sir , Coursera . I love to learn more psychology courses form this teacher in future.
Honestly, after sitting at home for two months in lockdown, I finally got myself to do something productive. This course was so helpful! I've been struggling with anxiety for years now and COVID just made things harder, but this definitely helps me cope. I'll be sure to pass on the information to family and friends. Thank you.
There are many things I have been doing since adolescence and never had a name for it. Not only did I learn the names for the techniques, but I learned new components to put it all in perspective. I cannot believe that I am unknowingly on the right track. Thank you so much for being a great teacher (external locus there? LOL)
Thank you very much! This course was extremely helpful and i recommended for all my family and friends. By the way, in my university we have a project that work with people who has anxiety and depression using exercice phisic to manage this disturbis. We proposed to then to do this course and the feedback is amazing. Congrats
Thank you Sir Dr.Steve for your humbleness of feeling for teach us in good way. Your expertise and casual way of approach that makes us very comfortable. Its like we have known you before.I  have learned about how to control my mind or any distraction. This course is too good. Thank for giving this great platform to us!!
Great course! Even though I am a psychology graduate and heard these tips from news and other mental health professionals before, this course really convinced me with scientific evidence why we should try these tips. Thanks Dr. Joordens! (P.S.: Dedication to healthcare workers was really thoughtful and affective.)
I believe the course is a perfect guide towards fighting with anxiety during this uncertain time. Well, we have always lived in a uncertain environment, so this is absolutely a perfect course for beginners to understand about the aspects of human psychology during uncertainty. Highly recommended to all age groups.
It's a wonderful course, and Prof. Steve Joordens is an awesome teacher! The way he inspires , talks, and carries himself is truly encouraging. This course is very informative too, I hope that someday, in the future, I'd also be able to help someone with the knowledge I encountered in this course! Thank you! ‚ô•
As a Psychology major student and a person who is going through all of this COVID and mental health issues in my own life, I found this course very helpful and guiding, personally and professionally. The topics are well explained and the recommendations, when applied are really effective. Thank you so much :)
A great course with much take-away and useful tips and information.  This (Covid) is unknown territory for everyone and I feel that the more we can put our minds and bodies at ease, the better we will be able to manage the stressors that are presented due to everything that is going on around us.  Thank you!
The course was really helpful to navigate my personal and professional life during this pandemic time. the course is extremely easy to understand the mental health  with effective strategies .                              Thank you Prof. Joordens for the great guidelines of social and physical distancing.
It was an awesome learning experience.I learnt a lot about anxiety management and time management during this period of isolation.Really helped me cope up with this crisis. I also realized the importance of social connections and learning new things and also carpe diem..thanks to the course instructor!!
A very nice way to gather some knowledge on The machinery underlying anxiety and how to control it, Managing anxiety by managing my environment and Understanding and managing the effects of isolation will help to manage our mental health during COVID-19. So i will recommend everyone to do this course.
This course was really interesting! I loved how prof Joordens talked about all the different aspects of anxiety and how to deal with it during those uncertain times. Also appreciating things we have rather than focusing on things we lost. "Mental health is definitely as important as physical health".
Steve fragmented the big mental health issue to face it by small steps. It really helped me to recognize and understand my body & mind more, also how to be relax before reacting to surprised situations that somehow break the common routine.Thank you so much, Steve, looking forward to another course.
Thank you Professor Joordens! I've learned a lot, I definitely enjoyed the whole course. You kinda hit all those points especially the Isolation part (I live alone in an apartment away from my family so I can be close to work). Much appreciation and virtual hugs from the Philippines. Keep safe!
It was extremely informative. Anyone can take up this course, there is no need to be in the medical field as such. These times can be hard on anyone, regardless of our age and this course talked about the needs of not only solving this issue but identifying it from the roots and accepting it.
Thank you so much for this course. I was following a schedule I the beginning but then it got off track. But when I was doing it I felt much more in control and my anxiety was in check too. I am definitely going to start doing it again and incorporate the helpful tips that you have provided.
Really appreciated having taken this course and it really has shown me the ways in which I and the others around me have changed and in a way become us. I wish to really put into practice everything discussed in this course and help others as well to find their self again.Thank you so much!
It was really helpful and motivating. I was really struggling with all this isolation now I have plenty to do. It is always better to have internal control than getting panic or anxious about things. Life is a journey and one must keep its head up to face the coming challenges on his ways.
Very informative.  Also provided concrete steps to conquer problems in today's pandemic situation,  Understanding the workings of the mind and emotion makes me less anxious.  The visuals presented were helpful.  The videos are well planned.  I recommended it to my friends.  Thanks a lot!
The knowledge and skills gained from this course are not only applicable during this pandemic period but will be useful in daily life. Prof Steve has a very calm and personal way of delivering the lectures making the course a great learning experience. Thank you for creating this course.
Thank you so much Professor Joordens for such an amazing course. It was to the point, informative, interesting, fun to watch, and is applicable far beyond just this COVID-19 pandemic. I feel much better equipped to handle my own anxieties as well as help my loved ones through theirs.
I really enjoyed the course and learned some beneficial takeaways for me to implement into my daily life such as the mindfulness practice. I appreciated that the content was delivered in a semi-casual and chatty manner as it made learning easier. Thank you for the wonderful course!
That was one of the most engaging courses I have ever had. Thank you ,Professor Joordens for this  warmth and positivity. Besides calming myself down, I had a lot of new staff about psychology which have awakened my curiosity. I would have rated 10 if it was possible. THANK YOU :)
Very interesting. For me this course really reiterated a lot of the 'tools' I already had in my 'toolbox'. It was good to hear them again with the suggestion of the relaxation exercise which I had learned around 30 years ago and for some reason pushed aside in my mind. Thank you.
This course makes me sad because I wish I have a lecturer like Steve Joordens in real life. In all seriousness, this course helps me understand the more about how the mind works and how to "control" it. The explanation was simple yet understandable. I really enjoyed this course!
this is kind of a new things for me, but then instead of makes me doubt, this mind control thing actually triggering my self to continue every video that given to me, and in the end its veeeeery helpfull for me, i mean not only the certificate or score, but for my inner self.
It's very much helpful to learn ourselves to get in a mind control and preserve our mental health during this pandemic isolation as well the quarantine period. and you can also inculcate our loved ones about this. It was quiet a nice experience that could learn more about it.
it was really helpful! I now manage this time of crisis much better. For example, I dont watch news anymore because i couldn't able to budget :D I try my best to connect and reconnect people and family members. I also dance, sing and paint every suitable time. so thank you!!
A simple yet lucid discussion of the predicament that all of us are in across the world. Have found the presentation to be excellent and soothing. The suggestions sometimes amusing and very practical presented effectively for for any lay person (non-psychologist). Thank you!
When i joined this course, i was just  looking for something to pratice my english. However, i have learned a lot of things that i used to underestimated, like emotional control. This experience allowed me to understant better how our mind affects ourselfs and our health.
I learned a lot and will try my best to apply everything I've learned from the course. This course albeit short was very helpful. It has also provided me with some ideas for my action research proposal that I will be implementing to senior high school learners. Thank you!
The course was great! It certainly provided a lot of information regarding how to handle mental health during the pandemic. The teacher was amazing! Found his method of teaching very informative. Going to check out more courses by him for sure. Thank you for this course!
