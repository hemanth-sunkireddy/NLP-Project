I really wanted to love this course. The video content offers a few tiny pearls of wisdom, but I gather that you could just read the book called Contagion and get exactly the same content without spending $100. Apprehensive about other Coursera offerings now.
I learned nothing from this course actually, it is so basic and unpersonal it seems a bit of oximoron, considering it had to teach us how to craft viral messages. It's just a step above a Ted talk.
I would not recommend this course. The presentation slides and the given examples were rather boring.  I did not learn any pragmatical strategy for my daily life as a marketeer.
The Course is very short and lacks the depth and practice.
This course is titled "How to Craft Contagious Content," but it, at no point, asks that you practice doing so. Instead, it is a (short) series of videos followed by quizzes that I could have passed without ever watching said videos. Anyone looking to employ a content producer of any kind will want to see that you have experience doing so, and I thought this course would provide an opportunity to craft content and receive feedback on it. I do not think this course is worth the money.
Not enough information. Not enough learning happening. Need a longer course - this was more like a conference talk
Requiring payment, especially such a high payment, to take the quizzes for such a simple class is ridiculous.
more practical advices would be better than repetitively say "there is a science behind a viral content"
Expected more. Nothing new, if you already had some ties into marketing.
If you read his book that's enough nothing new then.
Small amount of information, which 
obviously
This is interesting, (especially learning how things often work in a counter-intuitive manner) informative and well-presented, but I wouldn't call it a course.  It is much more like a seminar, albeit a good one, akin to a few TED talks broken up into bite-sized pieces with four quizzes, each after about 30 minutes of material divided into several segments.  It can be completed in two hours.  There is a lack of student discussion, which for me, is one of the most enjoyable and useful aspects of MOOCs.  I wish Coursera would make it clear when a course is on-demand, as was done previously.  I understand Coursera is seeking to find ways to monetize their product, and perhaps it is worthwhile for some to spend $95 for a certificate from Wharton, employing the prestige of the institution for use as a diploma mill.  I have taken other MOOCs that demand 6-12 weeks of serious effort with the cost of the certificate at half your cost.  A bit off-topic:  The professor mentioned deciding to wear a jacket in order to be taken seriously due to his youthful appearance.  I understand the problem, as I was once mistaken for a high school intern when I was a 27-year-old college graduate, and I was probably carded until almost 40, which is ego-boosting for a female, except when hearing, "must have been some party," when I had been up with sick kids all night .  Unless it is especially fashionable in that neck of the woods, I would suggest losing the funky, bad perm; it was the first thing I noticed.  With that excellent, strong, masculine bone structure, there are many classic and modern styles that would be far more flattering.
The course provides you with some basic information about the viral marketing and how to craft contagious content. It is more like an introduction or an introductory class. Professor Berger's way of teaching is very professional and he supports the marketing theories with lots of interesting examples you can easily relate to. However, this course lacks more exercises and more lectures for the students. There are only 4 quizzes to test your knowledge. This is my second course here on coursera.com and I can't help comparing this one to the one I took 3 moths ago: A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment. That course cost me only 45$ and gave me so much more, compared to this one which costs 95$ and gives very little. I will presume that Professor Berger is new here on coursera.com and that the course creators wanted to use his name and reputation to attract more students, but for us who opt for the certificate (to possibly increase the job prospects) it is quite disappointing.
Hi! I am very disappointed that there is no possibilities to download the slides that are presented during videos. Why so, if I paid for the Course? Really, there is nothing difficult to pause a video and make a screenshot of a slide or cut it and insert into Word but why make it so difficult? I always keep slides from other Courses in order to refresh the materials later. And I believe that this possibility can also make the Course of Mr. Berger viral . If I can share his slides with my colleagues and refer to his Course, it can bring more students to him. Do I want now to share about this Course with anyone? Most likely not. If I would know about such inconvinience (no slides available for downloading)  beforehand I would not go to the Course at all. It gives very negative feeling both on the Professor's Attitude towards students and also on Coursera team towards its clients. Learning is a possibility to come back to notes of a Course later, refresh it in memory and use it in everyday life or at work. I would appreciate if the team of Coursera will consider this and provide with slides' download possibility in every Course or Inform after the titles of the Courses that the slides are not available for download. We will see then how many people would like to join such courses. Best regards, Natalia Turkulainen
Pretty basic info, and I breezed through the entire course in one evening. It was a great review and way to connect ideas and I enjoyed it, but there wasn't anything exceptionally profound or concrete that I learned from it. The quiz questions and answers could use an editor. They were practically unintelligible at times, with lots of typos, grammatical errors, missing words, and more. Definitely wouldn't be worth $95, but great and enjoyable as something that you just listen to for an evening.
This course would be of great support for an undergrad student looking into other areas of marketing and research. The content is not new, actually feels a bit date given the examples used. I did enjoy the course because I like to learn and test my learning, BUT it lacks depth.  There is no reading material which would have helped with the lack of depth. Bottom line for me is, I get a certificate in LinkedIn from Wharton, but truth be told anyone can audit this.
It was a nice general course that did not go into detail about its content. It provided a general idea and started a conversation but I did not feel like I learned as much as I could have about the proposed topics. Technically speaking the sound was really low and the quizzes sometimes had unrelated answers with errors. Overall I do not regret taking the course, however I am left with feeling that I did not gain as much as I wanted to from it.
Jonah Berger delivers an interesting course on some of the key aspects of marketing and content generation. However, there is a difference between learning how to do something and learning how something happens. The course, in my opinion, fails to clearly show HOW to craft contagious content and shows only a little bit of the science that would help understand HOW contagious content is produced and spreads.
This course is brief and very concrete. It introduces key concepts to help you to create content that matters. I strongly recommend you to complete it if you are playing a community manager role, or if you are working in a marketing team, or even if you are a learning content developer, as you will find here a lot of tips to engage your learners.
All in all it is a great course to find resources and get a general overview of how things catch on. I liked it as an introduction to the subject, but I do think that more excercises were in order to fully grasp the theory that was very well illustrated by examples in the videos, and actually learn how to craft the contagious content.
Nice course. What I like the most is that Berger combines his ideas about contagiousness and Heath brothers' ideas about ideas' stickiness (which he also doesin his book Contagiousness) with Social Network Analysis which is the logical next step - which ideas stick + which ideas get shared + what is the sharing infrastructure.
Overall the course was just alright. Being an advertising professional, a lot of the information was a bit dated, the course materials (ie. presentation materials) were't clear nor concise and many of the topics were things I already knew (which is a bit of a bummer given the price of the course). On to the next course.
The course was good but provided only a brief overview on the topic and if you want a certificate you have to pay Euro 85,00. The course includes only 2.5 hours of video lectures and there are no additional readings available. I did the whole course within one day. Don't know why this course should be that expensive!
The inclusion of weekly assignments wherein the candidate is required to apply the weekly concepts learned in a case study/situation would have provided more value to the course; and also it would have given a chance to the learner to actually try and craft contagious content.
Very interesting material, presented by a consummate educator/performer. Not at all clear how to apply this interesting information, though. I think this course is missing at least 2 weeks of work that integrates the information and suggests practical pathways for use.
While the course was interesting, I personally felt that the examples that were provided were not recent (actually quite dated). I really hope they update the course with more updated content to make it relevant and engaging for people enrolling.
Most things were what I already knew about since I have done my MSc Marketing but there were still some ideas/concepts that I hadn't learnt or not really focused on which were an eye opener. Thank you providing with this great opportunity.
It was a good course but I found it very redundant with his  book, would have preferred if he built on and expanded on the ideas in Contagious.  I also found it short, almost like a mini-course, about 5 hours to complete.
Great course, a great refresher for those needing a little assistance or motivation. Really happy I did the course, do wish there was less examples (videos/ads) and more content. Overall, good course.
The course content is interesting but it is way too short and so little content inside,  a bit disappointing.....  Nevertheless, thank you very much for creating this course.  I enjoyed it.
Interesting content with lively delivery. However, the course is extremely brief and certainly not worth 95 USD. I'd see more value in buying the professor's book.
This was useful, I imagine I will have to take another course to supplement this basic information. I just wish the sound had been more audible.
Simple and easy. It's more like an introductory lecture, than a full course. But it's quite good. It's just I have missed more information.
Interesting information provided, however the last two weeks were more useful than the introductory weeks. Thanks and best wishes.
Good insights and very interesting but doesn't go as deep as it's expected from a 4 week course. Still, I would recommend it.
Good general tips. Completed it in a week. Lectures are short so if you have the focus and time, do it in 1-2 days. :)
It was a good course. I just wish the quizzes/tests were more challenging and allowed us to put the skills to use.
Very interesting content but more of a marketing for own books. Thanks nevertheless for the insightful course
It's very concrete information related to a particular book, but the ideas are simple and easy to understand
It wasn't bad or good, I was hoping to learn more information but I will walk away with a few nuggets.
High quality content but unf. its too short to aquire an deeper insight into viral marketing.
The foundations may still hold true but the references are really outdated.
It's good course to know abouts basics of crafting contagious content..
I would have liked more examples and ways to apply these learnings.
Good for watching, but need more exercise.
Content was good but not very helpful.
Very Basic Information.
I loved the course for its micro approach to understanding public and personal behavior. It introduced me to the different facets of behavioral psychology of consumers and the underlying phenomenon behind the macro interactions and responses to certain ideas. I loved the fact that it was quick in its duration and length, I'd have loved doing an assignment as at least one of the assessments though. Thank you Coursera, Thank you Jonah and UPenn for designing this course. Looking forward to learning more here.
Very good and very well thought of course. Great lectures, thorough explanation
with great intriguing examples. I wished however to go more deeper into this
and maybe have been shown how to apply this practically in business.
The course was informative but as it was mentioned that its a 4 week course i think it should be mentioned that its a 1 week course
Very useful and practical information. Very nice (engaging) content and presentation. I wish it was a bit more long and more involved. Current format is too concise and quick (overview type), would love to have more deeper (depth) course in future. And, ideally, the quizzes should have different questions presented in each attempt with only maximum 3 attempts ever allowed. That's the only way to test us (students) to know how much we have grasped.Thanks to all who put it together and gave us an opportunity to learn, that too free and on-demand. I have taken many courses in Coursera in last 2 years and ones from Wharton (Univ of Penn) are close to the best ones among all.
This is a fairly basic course about using psychology to influence others to take up your message, product, or service. I really liked the professor's use of visual aids during the lectures to help in communicating the topics being taught. I only wish the course was a little longer, and the professor could perhaps add something in about the possible ethical issues of using the two methods taught. The professor could add in a final peer-review written assignment - as there is no final - where students choose what message they want to convey given a choice of products or services, and how they would craft contagious content to communicate this message to others.
Content taught by Professor Berger is really interesting. By explaining clearly the science behind the creation of contagious content, he is able to actually share some non-obvious and counter intuitive information about the matter, which is probably going to be very useful professionally. However, I would say that the information provided is more of a seminar rather than a course. Besides that, tests are too easy and I wish it would have analytical and discursive exercises that would require more effort of the students and therefore, a true understanding of the concepts.
I enjoyed the content of this course, but I wish there was more to it - it was too brief. It would be nice to have more practical content with ideas about how to make these ideas work in one's company. Or to just tease out the strategies he discussed. Perhaps having reading assignments and other sorts of resources available would have made this course a richer experience. It feels much more like a taste rather than the whole meal.
Great course that will give you all the things to think about when crafting good content. The classes are the right length, they provide great examples that help you remember their content. It could go a little further into strategies. I also felt that the tests could involve more practical exercises like redrafting of weak content, for example, to put things into practice rather than "simple" multiple choices tests.
There was a typo in the week 4 course, occasionally side topics were discussed to thoroughly, whilst more important topics, such as concrete strategies to approach potential clients were completely left out. In week 3, there was also too much time dedicated to the examples in commercials. Week 2 lacked a lot of crucial studies and information that would have been paramount to this topic.
I am new in marketing, just getting importance of it at my new job. In my expirience, I found the course easy and facinating beacause, it allowed me to know the basics. I found the answer for that famous question; Why is my product not having the sales I want? If its that good, compered to the market. Why is that my information is that basic and other people get that more attention?
Overall, the course is easy to understand and the professor presents plenty of examples and cases to make your understanding better and it's fun. But I wouldn't recommend this course to those seeking for a learning on a practical level or something that can be put into work immediately. This course deals more about concepts and theories of viral marketing. Still worth learning.
Really liked the content and the presentation. I'd have loved if you could've added a case study or two and helped us assess how well we're applying the SUCCESs and STEPPS frameworks. Your explanations were very neatly framed and simple to understand. I'd love to reach out to you sometime with a business problem to understand if my application of these frameworks makes sense.
Very fresh view and quality approach on a very interesting topic. On top of that I really enjoyed the effectiveness of the instructor in delivering the materials. I will give it a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because in my opinion the slides of the lectures should have been made available and also I expected the modules to have more materials. But nonetheless, a high quality course.
I enjoyed it a lot. He breaks it down into to easy to understand processes and then gives good examples. I like the way he uses the word 'imagine', asking us to try create a picture of what he is trying to describe. He great examples also assist in creating cues to remember. it would have been nice to have had an exercise to do.. to put his theory to practice.
The course is well designed and articulate. However from the POV of a working professional (working in Brand Management for about 4 years) I found the initial modules a bit generic. Also if you could include certain tangible metric for the assement of potentially viral content that would make it a little more applicable in day to day working.
The course covers both theory and practice. It is therefore useful for both academicians and practitioners. I strongly recommend it. In a future follow up course there could be more teaching on how to make products or ideas viral on social networks such as LinkedIn, facebook, twitter. Maybe on when or how to post the content on social media.
Fantastic Course, very well crafted for an online environment. The course was well planned and gave us a clear view on how things happen and what we need to do to get something like this in place. The lecturer was so good, this gave me an understanding on what to expect from a college like this and the value that they deliver.
Loved it! I think it would be great to add some updated videos about Social Media examples since it has grown a lot in the last few years. The most recent examples were the ALS campaign and I think there's a whole lot more to try to explain the principles from the class. Overall, very nice experience and also very helpful.
Great tips that made a lot of sense.  These were delivered in an easy manner and the instructor was quite credible.  Videos were short and to the point.  Would have been great if there had been some specific exercises to conduct or a short project to work, where we could apply the learnings from the sessions.
Generally a nice push into the right direction. Makes you think and makes sense - Although very broad. For a course with a certification not representative at all. I would not feel comfortable showing this at a job interview. It's basically the quick video summary of his book I assume... Not very scientific.
The course was very beneficial in knowing the scientific and psychological impact of consumer behaviors and social influence. Professor Jonah was great and he was able to make every point very clear. However I expected the course to have more reading  materials or project or any sort of other activities too.
A very useful course. Professor Berger's style of delivery is good. It opened up my eyes to different aspects of viral marketing in a coherent and cogent manner. It may be useful to incorporate one more week to actually show how to craft contagious content using the different aspects taught earlier.
Great info and insights, presented in appropriate lesson length and depth. I do suggest that someone take a look at the questionnaire content for grammar and general comprehension. Several questions were confusing; I wasn't sure what they were asking, due to grammatical errors. Strange but true!
While short & to the point, I would have liked to see more examples of each concept in order to better illustrate the point. Also, more data on the science behind his material would be appreciated. Despite only auditing the course, I was marked late for the quizzes which I could not take.
Usefull information, clear explanations, and I liked the examples as real advertisement. Teacher has good energy to communicate and the structure of the course makes sense and it is easy to follow. The course was quite short, and I missed more techniques to create viral / sticky content.
Being a second year business administration student, I found this course very interesting. I have a vague idea about Marketing and the information that i learned will surely help me. However, maybe we can use a bit more visual example to explain each concepts. Great lectures, Thank you!
Very easy to follow. Teacher speaks very clearly and provides good examples. The course is very dynamic. I put only four stars because I found that the last week did not bring enough interesting material compared to the others (did not feel like taking any notes). Thank you very much ;)
The course was very easy to digest with interesting stories to help remember why certain marketing content is exactly what this course describes as "viral and contagious content". However, I do wish it went a bit more in-depth for those of us who are no stranger to the marketing world.
I enjoyed the content of the class and it sparked me to become a more well rounded graphic designer and consultant. Though some information and the class went by quickly, I'm eager to look into other resources to help further my understanding of the science of marketing.
Thank you to Prof. Jonah Berger to have made this course easily understandable!It was such a pleasure to learn from him who is teaching in a prestigious University as UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. Thank you to #Coursera to make this great platform available to everyone.
The course has been effective in communicating the concepts through numerous examples. the course pattern and design helps connect the learning islands for the student. Use of activities or tasks or smaller practical quiz may enhance the learning and participation.
This course had a ton of great information about marketing! There were a lot of relatable stories and tons of examples that really help the course content stick. It's a relatively short course which makes me wish it were free to complete and not just audit.
It has good information but I wish it would let you submit the quizzes without forcing you to upgrade. The grading is automatic and it's a good way of making sure you're understanding the content of the course even if you are not getting the certificate.
The course give you the main points to consider and think about while struggling to create influential and viral contents. However, I expected something more in-depth. Overall, for the little time you need to finish the course, it is worth enrolling. :)
Very interesting and engaging. I think I finished the first three weeks in two evenings. Will definitely recommend this course to others. A lot of the material is common sense, psychology wise but not something most of us think to on a day to day basis.
The only downside of the course was that it seemed so short. The lectures could have been longer and further in-depth. I only say this is because i absolutely enjoyed myself and learnt a lot about the power of content and network creation. Much needed.
This was really helpful for me to understand social behaviours and how they influence the spread of ideas. I hope to take another similar course in the future from Prof. Berger! He talks clearly and explains stuff in a way everyone can understand.
Thank you for the up mood and positive attitude while teaching the class. It helped me finish it a lot earlier that I expected. However I thought the lessons and the assignments would be more in depth and would give me more news on the subject.
Simple and easy to understand, but I think if more tools tips (practical information) it will be better than this one. My expectation for this course is about the hack to make a viral marketing with knowledge and the tools. However, it is okay!
The course itself is very good; Interesting, fun, and full of knowledge. Though the video sound is very low and they have a few test errors. I am sure the test errors and video sound will be fixed shortly. Other then than I love the course.
Very easy to understand and follow. No abundance of theories, but with several interesting case. However, the course still remains at a relatively theoretical level which doesn't bridge the gap between concepts and real life application.
It was a great course for me, as a business student, to know more about viral marketing and how the viral content is made and shared on various social platforms.It will also help people who are into blogging or any type of creative work.
My only issues was the video - the sound isn't loud enough. Even when I put the sound on max on the webpage and on my laptop I struggled to hear what the professor was saying (some moderate noise in other rooms of my appartment).
The course is interesting and very informative and useful.Professor Jonah does great work explaining and demonstrating the material.For improvement - a little more assignments would help better assimilate the course material.
Lots of useful and interesting information. Moves VERY fast, and would be nice to tie EVERYTHING together in the end, and maybe have some peer graded assignments so we can try to put everything into perspective and practice.
Very useful tips on how to generate contagious content. However, I would have liked to see more practical examples related to social media (Facebook, Instagram and Youtube specific hints to help something becoming viral...)
It shows a new perspective on marketing, it is pretty superficial but enough to give you material on which to research new topics to continue your learning on a somewhat obscure marketing area, which is contagious content.
If you can 'explain' why certain pictures are great, you are a great photographer. This course will help you identify and understand the science why certain ideas/products go viral and guide you to create one yourself.
Fun, short and easily understood. I highly recommend anyone with an interest in psychology and business to take this course so that you can implement some of the strategies learned from this course into your workplace!
The professor is very humorous,and the cases that he mentioned are really vivid and useful. The concepts that I have learned from the subject could be applied to my future working career. Really recommend this course.
I did not like that, in order to score my quiz, I had to upgrade and pay. The content was great... very useful. And I can't see how to make the course complete even though I won't upgrade to finish the quizzes.
Very eye-opening and useful information that once can apply in practice. I enjoyed the course a lot. Just one thing, personally, I would also appreciate to have some assignment(s) in addition to the quizzes.
Instructor was a great lecturer which kept me interested during the videos - something that I sometimes find online courses to be lacking. Material is interesting and useful. I very much enjoyed the course.
Very interesting content, excellent real life examples and case-studies. The course could benefit from more interaction and project or problem solving aimed at applying the content one is learning about.
Professor Berger was an extremely engaging lecturer. I don't know how much I can take from this particular course and apply to my current job but he certainly gave me a number of items to think about.
The content provided was very insightful. I do wish that more of the referenced materials in the lectures were sited accessibly with more links. (to be fair links to studies were sometimes provided)
Very well organized teaching material, easy to follow yet help guide me through "HOW" to craft content to accomplish a good content or even present ourselves through different media.Thank you
quite useful on a high-level, with examples to illustrate the key ideas and sciences behind why things catch on. Would like to read more in-depth of the book, or have more updated examples!
Overall great content. The assignments were quite basic so essentially the learning can be enhanced by adding on some assignments are customized and help imbibe the theoretical knowledge.
Interesting, catchy, informative, easy to digest with the use of good and simple examples! Just a bit too theoretical without providing enough how-to's - at least what I expected to see!
The course is very interesting and the speaker is truly spectacular. For improvement, if any were needed, I would put a pinch of interaction more, maybe with some practical exercise.
The content of the course is great... but it is expensive if you consider that there is not that much. It can be completed in two/three hours easily and it is more like a seminar.
Loved the classes by Prof Jonah Berger. I felt there was more content. Other than that it was simple to understand and the professor illustrated with excellent examples. Loved it.
It was a pleasure to take up this course , it doesn't feel like a course because the content is interesting.Thanks to the University,the Professor and Coursera for featuring it.
Excellent course! I loved learning how to craft contagious content with Jonah Berger. This course definitely helped me with my online business. I'm really thankful for that!
The Course has helped me understand the science behind creating content that can help spread information about products or services in the most effective manners. Thank You!
Very solid. Love how concise the whole course was. The only thing that I felt it was missing was access to other resources for more in depth research on particular topics.
For some reason,I found this course a lot less boring.Most of the ideas in the course were intuitive but the instructor gives solid understanding for each one of them.
It's concret, effective and with interesting resources. Great communication and powerfull and practical ideas. I'd love more steps and weeks. Congrats to everyone!
Great course, easy to understand. I would have loved a bit more as far as coming up with ideas on how to craft our own content. But it does help regardless!
I think that exceeded my expectations by taking the course,  and I am very happy for this. I have put in practice all the teory. I am gratefull. Thank you.
Useful course to understand viral marketing in a simple and effective way. Loved the analogies, examples given for every concepts. Professor is awesome
Jonah Berger   you have done a fab job!!very interesting course to a newbie like me.like the out of box thinking examples quoted throughout the course
Brief course (1-1.5 hours a week) with good points for practical application. Sometimes a bit theoretical without apparent practical application.
This course was an excellent introduction to the topic. A next level in which the concepts are addressed at a deeper level would be helpful.
Good info, easy quizzes, fun examples, quite common sense, but good to brush up on the theories/concepts behind the different strategies.
i really liked the way professor expressed the content.inspite of being  abslututely new to this field icould understand it really well.
Valuable information and great to refresh a lot of things. However, still very basic and more of an introduction than digging deeper.
Great general overview of the subject. I've been able to inject some of the principles to my business approach to marketing already.
It is a good course and the lectures given  by professor jonah berger are informative.I am NOW eager to read his book, Contagious...
it gave me some new information on Marketing that i didnt know before, and it was easy to understand and approach for new learners.
The content is easy to understand but maybe too light. The professor is great and have a nice voice. It's easy to understand.
Great course, very engaging. Wish there was more homework, or other hands on exercises to really lock in the new knowledge.
Great great course! Chocked full of very useful information. Awesome instructor. Never a dull moment. doesn't bore at all.
Loved it, wish there was more information, and more in depth. Like a how to step by step so it can be applied to everyone.
Insightful, easy to digest content that is helpful in rethinking how one might approach storytelling and marketing.
Simple to understand and implement concept, explained very well by the professor. Should have more group exercises.
Extremely well presented, fleshes the challenges of viral marketing and adds to your social media marketing skills.
Light, breezy course with a conversational tone. Easy to get through, easy to understand, and enjoyable to learn.
I enjoyed the course but I think adding a practical aspect to it like an assignment would make it more effective
Some of the content are too outdated. It'd be great if the lessons link to social media/ online marketing more.
I love it, Its very easy to understand and practical this course, I hope to re open to take the certification.
Good Introductory course; could have been much more intensive with project submissions and more interactivity.
Easy to understand concepts and a great introduction to what makes things go viral! Loved every minute of it!
Knowing the value of the course it's making me make my work and efforts that much more effective! Thank you!
Good chance to renew your knowledge or, if you start from scratch, to get in to the idea of viral marketing.
Interesting topic, well explained using a lot of practical examples. Could have gone deeper into the topics.
I've really appreciated this course. The Instructor Jonah Berger is very capable in conveying the concepts.
The theory was fine, but I think it may need more practice on the learning process. Content is very useful.
Very interesting and useful, I've just add more examples and practical use of the Idea.Thank you very much.
Easy to understand and interesting lectures that gives a clear view of the topics within a very short time.
The course provided some good material. Some of the material was basic knowledge and some were new to me.
Interesting course. Was short, concise and to the point. I liked that the videos were short yet engaging.
I thought this was a very in-depth yet concise course. However, I wouldn't mind having harder questions.
Great content and examples. I wish there were more practical exercises to help to create viral content.
I didnt pay for the course but still the content is valuable, the professor is good at explaining stuff
I liked the course but I wish it was a bit bigger.  It was nice that there were many examples given!
Content is great! Maybe we could have more practical exercises to craft content and submit to group.
The concepts are good really insightful. However, some actionable strategies would add more value.
The class was very informative and will aid in my quest to improve my digital marketing schools.
very simple tp understand and speaker is very interactive and natural as well in explaining
A lot of good content. I took a lot of notes. I'd like to see a bit more specific "how to".
Great course, I think everybody should understand this. It is a great learning for life :)
The content is very informative. Would prefer slides to be available as pdf in the course.
my thought changed after this course .and i suggest everyone who wants to start marketing.
Simple and pragmatic, lots of good tips about the concepts behind effective viral content
The course is very informative and useful.  Adding more exercises would help to students.
Easy to understand but profoundly based. But there could have been more course material.
Slightly simple, but well done in any case. Good for those with no marketing background.
Easy to follow. Short and Sweet. Finished the content in far less time than estimated.
Interesting content, however a bit superficial (which was expected considering the len
Very helpful course and i have learned alot of things through this education journey.
Show you the basic principles of how to make you spread your ideas and communication!
Excellent summary of social network marketing.  It was well worth the time invested.
The first two weeks were easy to apply to real life, the last two are a bit harder.
Good content, short and simple.    Takeaway (SUCCES) is one you will remember!  :-)
Very informative and easy to follow. Lecturer speaks in a clear and concise manner.

Very useful course. I had already read the whole book "Contagious" so it helped me a lot before actually starting this online course. The material is very intersting and filled with useful insights.
Very interesting subject! There's science behind all viral contents. It's not the luck. Very easy to understand and put into practice. Best teacher I've ever learned with. Love this course so much!
The course provides very useful insights and tips, and is very relevant for marketers who wish to better reach out to their prospective customers. It would be great if there were some practical hands on exercises that cements the concepts taught in this course.
Easy to digest and immediately applicable.
Pleasant tone, many tangible illustrations that bring the theory to life. Well-balanced pace. Could be complemented by a practical exercise - but perfect for working professionals who have less time.
I recently started a new position in my company and this course really helped me figure out how to take our content creation to the next level.
One of the best marketing courses I've taken so far! Berger explain every concept in a very easy-to-understand way. Highly recommendable!

Great...
It has been an amazing journey into Viral Marketing course, i will be missing lectures so much, thank you Professor Berger for giving me a chance to go through this course. Creative atmosphere,great and concrete examples of marketing successfully made actions from well-known world companies, SUCCESs rule is 100% to use,consistent information full of science facts,marketing bases and rules how to gain more influence on market within the power of social networkall this very well explained and very useful in terms of providing more success to business, ideas or whatever you're interested to promote.i highly recommend to go through this Course and get all the marketing tricks into your business/work experience
Non-pretentious, simple, interesting, and has that professor charisma that make classes enjoyable. Many professors teach incredibly interesting content but deliver that content by reciting powerpoints, dull, and no emotion or energy while speaking. Prof Berger's classes are just right. Not too short, not too long, not speaking too loudly, but by finding that right balance. A lot of Coursera courses seem interesting and their content is interesting but the way professor teaches just seems miserable and like a waste of time. Glad to see that's not the case here.
Awesome course , completed the course in one day.The delivery of the lectures of Mr. Jonah Berger is really nice & he has compressed so much material in almost 2 hours of video with relevant real world examples.Although,I feel the level of quizzes could be a lot higher & questions could be asked from a real world example given in a paragraph or video.That, being said I would highly recommend this course especially if you are planning to start your own business or want to grow your current business or in general if you are interested in Business & Management.
I took this course when I was launching a new internal product. I've always been an individual contributor. So, having to convince and make the new product CATCH ON is totally outside my comfort zone. Prof Jonah Berger has laid out key frameworks and vivid examples in his lectures. The lessons stick on my memory and spur new ideas for my project. I've started applying the principles introduced in this course to my project and the participation rate improved significantly in 2 weeks!  Thank you again for your hard work in this marvelous field.
I am a recently graduated student with a limited knowledge on marketing to begin with. This course helped me gained a good understanding on the aspects you need to look into when crafting viral marketing content. I was privileged to complete this paid course free-of-charge, this means so much! Thanks Coursera for this wonderful opportunity.To tell more about the course, the use of examples, how the topics were divided and taught made me come back for more from Week-1 onward. Looking forward to learn more at Coursera. THANKS A LOT!!
Indeed an insightful course that is simply a must for anyone who wants to understand irrational, i.e. human, audiences better and communicate effectively. It is NOT just about viral marketing in the common sense. Concise yet full of interesting knowledge, with compelling real-world examples. Professor Berger's delivery is lively and natural yet always professional. As a next step, I'd be definitely interested in going more in-depth with further training on how to turn the knowledge acquired into practical skills.
A highly informative, applicable& easy to follow course by absolutely knowledgeable professor. The thorough, well-organized& engaging course content reflects the the professionalism & the extensive knowledge of the professor in this field. Really looking forward to enrolling in other courses by professor Jonah Berger & Wharton University of Pennsylvania. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you. Merry Christmas &Happy New Year. May all the blessings of the season shine upon you.
The professor is awesome. I like how he explains and the content he teaches is just so amazing with all the examples and case studies he brings up, but I don't like the idea that if I want to submit quiz answers, I should pay for the certificate in advance. I haven't decided whether I'll pay for the certificate, but I thought if i complete the course , I would definitely pay for that. The system that I should pay in advance, I would lose the chance to pay for the certificate in the future.
Dear Professor Berger,let me express my utter admiration of your amazing course! The material is so easy to understand, vivid examples and great explanantion made it such a pleasure to watch every video. I did the full course in two days beacause i just couldn't stop watching the videos, they are just fantastic! Thank you so much for your work, I feel like i have opened a new chapter in my life where i am likely to  fall in total love with Marketing. Best regards, Kholkina Anastasiya
The course, though short, is filled with insightful information on what makes products stick and how decisions are influenced. The length was actually one of the reasons I picked this course, given how easily it can be assimilated. Professor Berger's explanations are fantastic and really kept me focused throughout. The included snippets from famous ads really allowed me to appreciate the way marketers utilised various principles to better position their brands in the subconscious.
I loved this course. I enjoy every week and I found it very interesting. I don't have any other experience studying the psychological aspect of marketing so this was all really useful for me. At the other side some things were familiar to me since I have a Bachelor in Communications. In general it was an amazing course, specially if you already have some knowledge on marketing and other similar study areas to deepen your strategies. Thank you for creating this, again, loved it.
This is awesome! It highlight some fundamental things, that we may often not take into consideration, that we should do when we are trying to get people to pay attention. It's a big world and a lot of noise and these simple steps to get notice over all the noise.This course goes hand in hand with the Advertisement Design course that I just concluded. I'm keeping the videos for this course cause it will be my go to reference whenever I am considering creating content.
This is an excellent course that very elaborately explains the key concepts of a viral marketing campaign, with the help of suitable examples. The focus of this course on Human Psychology and the difference between: the way we think we behave & the way we actually behave, makes this course outstanding, & a must take course as well. (Especially, you're curious about the marketing campaigns of Great Brands!)Thank You Coursera & Wharton Online, for this amazing course!
I read the book, Contagious, a few years ago and after completing it I immediately recommended it to my colleagues for our marketing department and when I saw this course come up I knew I'd have to take it. The first time I applied these concepts to one of our companies social media posts it became our furthest reaching post, by far. This is very simple, yet powerful material. Jonah does a great job using his own techniques to make this enjoyable and memorable.
Though this course is priced a bit higher than the others, I feel the course content really delivered in terms of delivering insights into how things go viral by taking us to the very root of our behaviour as humans and our relationships with others. A particularly useful course for marketers who deal with a lot of content and campaigns and want to find more ways of getting them to stick with their end consumers and ensure they spread the word on.
Wonderful content! Now I start to understand some phenomenon and why some product or idea or behavior goes viral while others not. It's not a simple matter of one is better than the other. It actually denpends much on who spreads them and how to spread them. I strongly recommend this course to everyone who is looking to figure out the science behind those superficail facts and know more about the reasons why those facts happened.
I've taken several courses here at Coursera but none of them come close to this one, simply the best proffesor I've ever had the opportunity to learn from. English is not my first lenguage but you still made it very easy for me to understand everything. Hopefully I get to attend one of your classes in person someday. Also, just bought your book Contagious, I'll begin reading that now that I'm done with the course. Thank you!!!
I think the course “Viral
Marketing and How to Craft Contagious Content” is excellent! The topics covered are not difficult
to understand at all and the instructor was able to explain them in a very
simple and easy way, making it fun to watch the classes. It helped me have a
better understanding of what he facts that helps ideas or products to spread are,
and how viral marketing works. Excellent course overall!
This was a wonderful course! Absolutely enjoyed every single lecture video uploaded and can't wait to utilize what I've learned into my future career. Huge shout out to the professor as well for being so articulate, clear, and empathetic to student learnings. The videos are separated into short ones so it's a lot easier retaining focus and the professor uses plenty of examples to understand concepts better!
For me there are 2 important things and if they are present I would feel that I have invested my time (the most valuable resource for me) wisely:a) Great content, presented in a concise and easily digestible mannerb) Great speaker that is able to engage you and that respects the time you are investing in their courseThis course scores very high for both the above and I therefore highly recommend it.
Awesome course! Jonah Berger explains everything in a simple and catchy way. I believe that I have learned a lot, and I really enjoyed the course. It would be nice if course transcription was provided. May be notes to read through along the material. But aside all that, a big thank you to Coursera and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and professor Berger for putting it all together.
This course is filled with very practical and useful information that is useful at every level of the corporate hierarchy, even when it comes to simple strategies for getting employees to retain information. Obviously, the primary motivation for taking this course is to spread your company's content, and the solutions provided in this course will go a long way toward achieving that objective.
Information is nicely presented and easy to digest. I work in marketing, and the learnings in this course are applicable to a lot of decision-making activities that we do. This will give you a better and fresher perspective in terms of brand positioning. Clear examples are provided, which allows for easy understanding no matter where you are in the world. Many thanks, from the Philippines.
Great crash course on making content viral. It gives you the science behind viral content and provides great tips on how to make contagious content and act on networks.It provides as well a great easy-to-understand psychological basis for all the phenomenae around us concoerning viral content. Recommended!! (this would be word-to-mouth, one of the techniques suggested by Prof. Berger :) )
This is a very interesting and informative course. It really digs into the science behind why and what people choose to share in social networking, giving the student an understanding of how and what content to publish to engage their audience. The information is delivered in an easy to understand, organized, and entertaining manner. The professor did a great job! I highly recommend it.
I found the course very comprehensive yet easy to understand. Kudos to Prof. Berger who used conversational words in his lecture, as well as fun and appropriate examples. Grateful also to Coursera for a very user-friendly website and mobile app, which enabled me to study and learn even as I commute to work or going home. Thanks a lot and I will definitely enroll in a similar class!
The course and its presentation is reflective of the content presented in that it does exactly what it says its going to do and holds your attention while doing it. This is the perfect course to learn how to things go viral, how to make a lasting impression stick after you've left the room, and even provokes the thought process on the importance of reputation management.
Professor An insightful course with actionable, intuitive frameworks and tips to analyse virality of a content as well as how to work on a viral story and campaign. Professor Jonah Berger teaches in a delightful manner in bite-sized lectures taht are easy to understand, remember, and put to practical use. Recommend it to everyone irrespective of their profession.
The best class ever i took. This course was in 4 weeks and i did it in 2 days.You know because the teacher was able to teach at a very high level of teaching methods. He was the best man. I had requested if i can interact with him and i can't find him. This part i didn't like at all.Please tell him to email me or give his email so i can reach out to him. Thanks.
I loved this class. The professor crafted the information in a way that was interesting instead of a boring lecture. Everything said was related to the topic at hand, and I enjoyed how he started with a story before each lesson began. He was good with showing each concept in marketing instead of just telling about each concept. I highly recommend the course!
Recommended to anyone working in advertising or marketing. It's a brilliant 'refresher' course where you might know some things but you'll definitely explore the science behind others. What makes this great is the way in which the course is conducted, Mr. Berger does a fantastic job by building relevant context and Coursera made it extremely convenient.
Prof. Berger has explained the concepts in a very easy manner, making it interesting to learn.  Concepts are relevant and very close to how humans connect, share and spread information, but we generally don't pay attention to such details. Thank you Prof, I'll try to be more observant hence on. A must course for marketing and advertising professionals!
Recommend to everyone this course. Valuable thoughts and insights on the way how you should craft the information to reach the goal. Not only to make the message to become sticky, but to reach the real person. This should be taught in every university as part of the Marketing course, to realize the potential of everything you can do with a Marketing.
I'd give 6 out of 5 stars if I could! Prof. Berger is so clear, concise, and does a stellar job at mixing some cool psychology that's so practical and relevant yet interesting at the same time. Anyone can take this course  and probably finish it in a week, just because of how intriguing it is. WARNING: Highly Addictive Course Material inside!!!!
A lot of useful information valuable for negotiation of almost any type of service or product marketing I can think of. At first, I didn't like so much the format, but then, the capacity of the lecturer to síntesis is astonishing and greatly outscored the standard presentations. Will probably take it as a future reference again. Thank you!
I totally loved what this course offered! Too excited to execute the knowledge and the ideas that I got from this. The information and knowledge that I learned from this course are exceptional and I think everybody, whether he/she is from marketing or not. must learn this as the psychological concepts were too amazing. Highly recommended.
I was skeptical of online learning after I had an unpleasant experience before, but Professor Berger is superb! His lectures are on-point, sharp, and flawless. He supply his lectures with science and give easy-to-understand examples. His course is quick, but it's enough to learn the fundamentals. Thank you, Sir, and to Coursera as well!
The ideas and thoughts put out on this course is useful in a vast variety of ways; not just in marketing your product or business, but in influencing people and getting ideas to catch on. What I enjoyed the most about the course was the way these ideas were presented, and how examples and coined terms wee used to highlight key concepts.
Jonah's information was easy to understand and was useful. Compared to some other courses, I didn't get bored learning. Although it wasn't about how to write an ad or make a video, he covered possibly the most important part of marketing; how ideas stick. Hopefully he'll teach more marketing classes. Thanks for all the useful knowledge.
I usually have trouble with online courses as it becomes very difficult to stay focused on the course as there is only virtual interaction. But this was just amazing, great content, great information flow through the lessons and amazing speech (it was never boring). I´m very satisfied to have done this course and learnt this information
It is a verry concise course, full of solid information. It was easy to comprehend even with a minimun knowledge about the marketing field, and that is because it didn't came with a lot of scientific terms (or they were explained easily). Some knowledge in the behavioural sciences help at better understanding a big part of this course.
This course was so interesting and you will learn a lot of stuff . I didn't feel bored a minute. the videos were short, simple and the instructor was so genius in delivering the info with the simplest way and u didn't feel how much time u have been listen to this course. I loved it and I will return to check it every now and then
This was probably the easiest Coursera course I've ever done. Easiest in that I found the professor engaging and the material expertly and simply presented. The course content was thus readily digested and committed to memory. You can marathon this in less than a day and it won't feel like a chore because it's fun! Try it out. =)
I just adore the lecturer, I liked the examples suggested, because they clarified a certain phenomena by a very approachable way (considering the fact that I am an undergraduate student). Also, I was exciting to know more about human behaviour in terms of consuming, buying, interacting with people, because everything is so true!
Over time I have  been doing various courses that have never addressed the science of things and this was just the right course for me. Am so happy to have done it and I have already tested the learnings looked at the videos in depth and researched much more. Seeing the science is even more exciting thank you very much for this.
It was such a informative course.I did have an approximate idea about marketing but this course took my knowledge to a whole new level.The way Professor Jonah Berger explains made it even more interesting.The real life advertisements which he chose to add in the videos while explaining his points made it even more interesting.
Very entertaining. It is one of the better course on Coursera that doesn't seem like usual boring lecture. Doesn't require much willpower to complete the course since each lecture feels like watching youtube than Coursera. Prof Jonah Berger really know on what he talking about, i hope that this course will indeed "catch on".
Every moment of this course was pleasant and instructive, but it is so hard to admit that it is over. I definitely want to take other lessons from dear Jonah Berger. He opened an another window to my opinions. I ordered his "Contagious" book, and just finished with course. Looking forward to meeting you again, thank you!
I Just love this course. Being Social Media Marketing Expert, this course is really helpfull for me to understand the pros and cons of Viral marketing and contagious content. I have learned so many things and ideas.  I truly love the Prof. You're an amazingly genious Man. Thank you for this complied bunch of information.
It's a very intersting course, easy to follow what the teacher want to explain and even tho some things that he says are so "simple" or everyday stuff, with him, you can realize that these things can be used to advertise and that people keep your product or brand, highly recommended to know other marketing alternatives.
This is an amazing course! thank you so much! I originally got a book from a friend, started reading it but decided to take the course instead. So useful and interesting! recommending to anyone who might be starting their business or has one, who is in marketing or simply if you just wan to know why things catch on !:)
Really interesting course! Congratulations!Just a point: I think they could speak more about sales.  Big part of the idea here is not really helpful (and can even be dangerous) for small business. A note on direct marketing would be helpful.Anyway, it accomplishes its mission: to teach how to craft contagious content.
Professor Berger explained everything so clearly and succinctly, I hope I get to meet him one day. The knowledge I have obtained on this platform will benefit me, my employer, my clients, my family, my community, and every endeavor I take on moving forward. For this, I am heavily indebted. Thank you, Professor Berger!
I really loved this class. There is no magic formula to make a product goes viral, but there is a behavioural science behind that, and it answers to social
dynamics. Jonah Berger makes very nice examples to explain viral marketing and to make simple ideas stick into your mind. Easy to follow, class finished in 1 day.
It was a great course, though a bit short and is consistent of videos and quizzes only. It'd be great if it had some practical exercises - assignments or experiments. Since one of the major covered topics is social media I would imagine it won't be difficult to offer some examples or practical tests in that field.
Pr. Berger is very captivating from the first minute of every single class. It was a real pleasure to listen to him and also to all the detailed examples that really put things into context.I am a new freelancer in marketing and every single dollar spend on this certification was worth it.Thank you Pr. Berger.
Quite useful information that has cleared some points on how to spread messages to consumers. The material is easy to comprehend and follow. There's some invaluable information about word-of-mouth, how social networks work, and what strategies work better than others. Special thanks to professor Jonah Berger.
Thank you for the course! It is really helpful not only for the application in the marketing sphere, but also for communications and psychology. I like that there were a lot of examples to make some theoretical aspects more clear. The narration and teaching style are comprehensible and pleasant. Thank you!
Amazing course! I think it was an amazing resume of some good books that describe this same stuff, I would have given it 5 stars but i didn't felt the last week (Week 4) as good enough as the other ones, but i guess it's because to enter that topics (Sociology) would be another complete course by itself.
One of the best courses I've ever taken; A lot of great
information to learn from and apply in real life. The videos were very well
done and simple to follow including great examples that helped illustrate the
points being discussed. Hopefully I'll be able pay for a certificate soon.
Highly recommended!
I found myself extremely attentive throughout all four weeks of class. Jonah makes things simple (with only about 5-8 mins of each class) while continuously bringing a new perspective to viral marketing. Every second of class was important, informative, and interesting! The Tina's three I's! Thank you!
Best course I have ever taken, most useful one, automatically shapes the way you think and you start understanding in return how everything in society works. This is a weapon, way more powerful than it seems. Looking forward to taking more courses from instructor Berger if any get posted on Coursera.
This course was really interesting. I studied finance at university, and this marketing course is a great addition to my business knowledge. It opens my mind and widen my thoughts about the effective strategies used to make successful products or ideas. The examples and the explanations were awesome!
Thank you, Prof. Jonah Berger, for this course! I really enjoyed and learned a lot! I am excited to put in practice what I learned to help grow our business and other organizations I'm involved with. There clearly is science and not just random luck involved in crafting viral and contagious content.
It's now even more convincing that marketing in not some random discipline. There is a strong science behind a successful content. It involves active thinking. I will like to review this course before I embark on putting out any new idea.Jonah, if there is a word more than thank you, I will say it.
Coming from accounting and finance background with limited knowledge in marketing and digital marketing the powerful impact of social media and network, i find this course very useful in my current role as business partner to other function in my department when discussing ideas, strategy and plan.
It was good I really enjoyed learning about different ways to get a product of service to catch on. The only way I would have improved this course. Would be to have more of a challenge and testing. For example create a marketing campaign and get marked on this or write an article and get marked.
Even after reading all his books and journals, still I find this course as one of the best man-made intellectual enlightenment and I suspect that I will be taking Dr. Berger's other courses or reading future book and repeating myself, saying the same thing, "this is the best I've ever learned".
Very good material, easy and
clear for understanding lectures and very good professional speaker! Thank you
very much for sharing this course on Coursera! I would be honored to
participate in any course done by the same team in the future. Once again THANK
YOU VERY MUCH!  You guys are superb!!!
It was by far the most interesting and amusing course I have taken on coursera. It is absolutely life changing and i think that knowing these strategies will benefit everyone interested in building their own business, marketing their products or changing a behavior in a society or among peers.
I highly recommend this course to students with interests in social marketing, consumer behaviour and researching online communities. Five stars to Professor Jonah Berger; his lectures ignited my curiosity to get his book "Contagious: Why Things Catch On" and it's now on my to-be-read list.
The professor explains everything in a way that is very easy to follow. He uses good visuals and speaks clearly and I feel as though I finished this course with very valuable information that I can apply to my career. I was able to finish this whole course in one day. Highly recommend.
As a digital Marketer & a content producer I found this course to be very effective. It refreshed a lot of ideas for me & identified the problems i was facing in creating viral campaigns. I would suggest others to take this course, It is going to help you in creating viral campaigns.
I HIGHLY recommend this course! Jonah Berger structured a very useful content in a way that's very easy to comprehend and memorize. His examples are simple but effective and help A LOT to understand  how the mechanics of marketing work. Amazing. Thank you Both Coursera and Jonah!
It was such a great lesson with the concise explanations of the concepts. The teacher definitely broaden my vision about spreading contagious content through different strategies. The knowledge that I learned through this lesson will help me in my job and in the future as well.
This course is amazing! It contains all the information that you need; all the videos are accurate and provide you only the necessary useful material - no extra useless lectures. Huge thank you to the Professor for this valuable source of information! I absolutely recommend it!
Loved this course! Learned to understand how things go viral. The professor made the course fun to watch by adding interesting videos and making each section less than 10 minutes. By doing that I was able to remain focused and actually learn!! Everyone should take this class!
This course provides material vital to the success of any marketing campaign. I learned what makes products and services more appealing to their target market, and how this information is shared. I recommend this course for any small business owner or marketing professional.
An extraordinary course that teaches clearly that is needed for our content to become viral. It's not luck thing is to apply what we learn in our company here. You're a beginner or not, here you will learn new techniques that worked to expand your brand. Highly recommended.
I participated in this course, I read his book and I'm in love. I love how easy he breaks down core concepts in  marking and helps a student and business person like myself walk away with action items. I learned things I could use to improve my marketing strategy tomorrow!
It is an awesome course and has taught me a lot. It teaches as to why creating viral content is not a random phenomenon, but ha science behind it. It teaches creating sticky ideas, use of Networks, Marketing strategies and a lot more. All in all, it is a very nice course.
I feel like I understand everything that's both annoyed me and provoked my interest about marketing and the things that spread through social media. Presented excellently with confidence in the research!Very thankful for the wealth of information provided in this course!
I really enjoyed this course. It is given that I learned a lot but what surprised me the most is how fun and enjoyable the lessons were. They weren't dragging. Jonah Berger is such a great speaker that I felt like I was just talking to a friend while learning from him.
Professor Jonah Berger's lectures are very engaging, with good use of his tone of voice. The course material, examples and case studies are applicable to one's daily life hence, it'll be easier to recall and apply what we have learnt. Highly recommended course to take.
Jonah Berger is engaging and funny whilst opening your eyes to situations and possibilities through stories.  The course is a brilliant taster for the subject matter and makes you want to discover more of his work, like an angry panda whose cheese you've just rejected.
I love this course! There is a lot of useful information. He explains everything in a way that is simple and easy to understand. This course has valuable information that I'm sure will help me in the future when I try to market my products. I definitely recommend it!!
Prof. Berger is an amazing teacher. This entire lecture was fascinating, intriguing and thought provoking at the same time. Myself being a lecturer of marketing will be able to teach my students much better with the examples and analogies I've learnt in this course.
A lot of this course is based on the topics Professor Berger spoke about in "Contagious". It was an interesting course and I think if applied in all marketing strategies, can be helpful in determining how successful a campaign could be. I enjoyed taking this course!
I enjoyed the course immensely.  The lectures were both interesting and informative and I can honestly say that I have learned something new.  I now have a set of tools and knowledge that I can apply to my work.  The course has definitely met most of my objectives.
Apart from the well structured classes and the great instructor what is most fascinating is that the key messages which are meant to be conveyed, effortlessly stick to your mind and you are finishing the course knowing that it felt great to enrol for this course.

It's really very innovative idea of sharing a thing like that....the idea of crafting a contagious content is just eye catching and interesting...and is really very helpful...and I enjoyed learning the science and psychology behind the popularity of a product!
Great content and i thoroughly enjoyed the course. The professor had an in-depth knowledge about the subject. However he should have mentioned this book "The Tipping Point" as many of the things has already been discussed by Malcolm Gladwell. Thanks anyways
Professor Berger makes every lesson so easy to understand. His clear and relevant examples behind each information is so contagious that it sticks to my brain even after finishing this wonderful course. The lessons got are priceless & I highly recommend it!

This course was incredibly quick and effective in properly analyzing the uses of marketing. I was able to acquire a thorough understanding of how content is spread throughout the world and how to properly leverage social media to generate positive buzz.
I'm very thankful to Wharton and Coursera for such an amazing content. The course is well structured and the content is presented in an extraordinary way. I wish there is a Specialisation on this topic with more content and a capstoneThanks Prof. Jonah.
Admittedly a very theoretical instead of the practical course. But it does a very good job of explaining its own content very well. The plethora of examples and the very easy to understand explanation of the theory creates a very enjoyable experience.
Really great professor and fascinating content. I could relate this content not only to my work but to many areas of my life. I was thoroughly engaged throughout.One note- so many typos in the written content! It reflects poorly on such a good course.
This course enlightened me in ways that I cannot describe in words. I will forever be applying the SUCCES methods to my social media and branding efforts so that I can make some good viral videos! Thank you so much for this course! I loved it so much.

I read the book of Contagion few years back and listening to this course give me a very useful flashback on the content. It is simple to learn and many stories were given to help better understand the application of these strategies better.
