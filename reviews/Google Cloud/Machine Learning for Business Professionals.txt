Basically an advertising for Google services. Labs are especially useless. The lady doing the video sounds like a drug infomercial on TV.
Boring. Not application based. Still no idea what ml is.
The course tends to unclear on what you need to learn from the material for quizzes and then quizzes on industry knowledge not covered in the material. The Qwiklabs graded assignments used in this course has numerous bugs that can use up your attempts at performing the assignments. The Qwiklabs set up used can also make it difficult to pass for people with certain disabilities.
The tutorial made no sense. Could not follow the instructions to set up the lab i.e the rest of the course could not be completed.
Exercises are slow. GUIs offered for the exercises are terrible. And explanations are hand-wavy at best!
Comentan que es gratis y no te dejan concluirlo hasta que lo compres, es un enga√±o
This course is awful.  I recommend everyone stay away.  I want my money back.
confusing and poorly structured. basically a promotion to their tools
Let me un-enroll please. One of your videos was outdated.
The quizzes are very badly designed
found it not interesting
no option for qwiklabs
really bad experience
Not Relevant
I think this was a good introduction to some of the theories/motivations behind machine learning but it lacked a lot of depth. Most of the time, it just seemed to be an advertisement for Google and Google Cloud Services. I also felt like it lacked a lot of hands-on activities that would have been more enriching and instead just placed the explanations in the videos. For example, instead of a video explaining how to clean data, a hands-on activity where the student practiced cleaning a dataset would have been better. The labs just seemed like more advertisements for Google Cloud Services and I don't think I learned much from doing them. I think this is good foundational stuff if you've never touched ML before, but honestly I would not recommend paying for it. A more interactive course on ML, maybe one that does involve some coding or some data manipulation, is probably worth your time and money.
Not worth it gone for it cause it was available for me free it's not the basic and not the intermediate course it's some what in the middle of both which make the course hard to understand, If you want to a kick start with AI with zero knowledge go for the AI for everyone course which is the best for starters.
This is mostly a Google advertizement for its products. This is also lost in between, not targetted towards either analytics managers (too basic) or business managers (too technical and not relevant). But still informative in certain places
There is more that you can add. I felt it was rip off. We need more practical examples of how companies use ML.  What are different models of machine. The lab exercises were interesting though.
Provides a broad outline of ML. Probably too broad to be of any actual use. Ends up being an advertisement for Google products. Wish there was more of Val Fontama, and less of Lak Lakshmanan.
Because it is made from GCP, of course, there is a part when they showcase their products. I think I would not pay for 55 USD for this course because it is more like a general lecture.
An overview but lacks depth. Mainly as an advertising for the Google Cloud Platform and the Consulting Services Offered.
Felt Like Payed for Ad from Google.Initial parts were good.
very bad accent .
This course is focused more on the management side of machine learning (how to apply machine learning for your business, what does it take to apply machine learning in your business, what are the good or bad side of applying machine learning in your business, and so on). It really is not about the technical steps of getting started with applying machine learning for your business. The practice lab in the course can give you a little bit of insight about machine learning tools provided by Google Cloud, but that's not really helpful to understand how you will then use them for your specific business. One thing that is severely lacking from this course is about how businesses ethically obtain data from the customers or how businesses should appreciate customers' privacy right of their data. At its core, this course is really a good introduction of applying machine learning for businesses from management perspective. But I guess nothing in this course will give you a hard kickstart to apply machine learning for your business.
A good course, but not really informative. Unfortanately, I disliked the last module of this course.
This was overall a helpful course but could be improved.  It was nice to get some hands-on work with the Google Cloud tools but I felt that the instructions were confusing that that the video of the lab should have been shown before the lab rather than after.  The presenters were somewhat uneven, it seemed for them this was a training course in how to make presentations.  There was a high focus on doing what was ethical in terms of analyzing data.  This seemed to constitute 30-40% of the materials.  I agree that understanding bias is important in the analysis.  Still, until I know how the tools work, it seems hard to know how to anticipate the potential biases.  Seems that Google was trying to play to a different audience than the people taking the course in this regard.
The course was good in its contents.I learned some parts & APIs of the Google Cloud Platform which helps to create ML and AI enabled products for businesses. The course helped me to understand how can we implement the AI & ML for any business and get insights from the business data and eventually help the business to transcend. The Course explains various products and APIs offered by Google Cloud Platform which we can use to implement ML and also provides the Hand-on lab to practice some of the GCP APIs.But in my thoughts, the course lack in explaining the basics of the GCP APIs used and someone who is new to GCP might find it difficult to understand how GCP APIs work from the backend (but nevermind, as it is the out of the scope of this course).
The course sums up the concepts pretty neatly. However, I expect it to be a bit more technical and challenging in the lab and evaluation section. Also, many of the features in the GCP has changed after the video and therefore things aren't in sync. However, the course is not worth the money because you can get GCP subscription for free for 1 year and use youtube to learn the same as most of the contents are available there. You're paying the price for a glittering certificate.
Overall liked the flow. -May be some more examples/labs as well as a case study of a company went through their business transformation with ML would be helpful. -Some interviews with leading practitioners of ML as well as business leaders would be great.A module with specific advice for product managers, designers, C-executives, etc would be helpful.-Bringing in few solutions from non-Google would make course more complete. -Resources to follow-up would be superb.
Although the videos include very usefull information, sometimes a felt a lot of advertisement of google cloud products (which maybe I should have expected)The first graded assignment was excelent learning experience with dialogflow but with the others I felt just like following a bunch of instructions.
decent upto speed course, collects good expanse, the hands on labs are the best thing about the course; doesn't go in depth or charts path, course with additional learning resources: area where this course can improve upon maybe; all in all great course for anyone not at all technical
The virtual assistant excercise was qutie cool, because you could could easily apply it to a case that is close to you. For most of the other excercises with pre-set datasets and code, I did not learn a lot by just copy and pasting. I understand the google AI services better though.
Decent intro for someone you did not know what ML is. But in no way do I feel prepared to use it. Only 2 labs showed how to use the google cloud platform, but they did not show how to use your own data, or even how to collect data, just provided the data for you.
The course is good with few hands on tools that can be used for managers. However, many videos ended abruptly without any continuation. Also, the assessment shud be more comprehensive, each week only some 3-4 very simple questions were there.
Some module is very educational and easy to follow (and some is not as much). Lab sections can at time be confusing, try to look for things within GCP. More details (screenshots) how to navigate GCP will be a huge time saver!
Provided a good introduction of the course. However got a bit lost in Week 3 for the deep discussion and lab on data structure and analytic which i have no background. Some more background details to introduce can be better
The course definitly gave some good insights on ML. And is definitly a great course for someone relatively new to ML. But the "Quick labs" though requiring no coding, the concepts only scraped the surface.
It was ok. I am more on the technical side so it was completely a new way to look at ML for me. Also, some of the use cases depicted helped me understand up-to what extent ML can be used
Horrible Instructor in week 2&3 could hardly follow him even gave his videos a thumbs down.. other instructors were good thanks to them I was able to follow and finish the course
This is an excellent course for someone who want to get a gist of Machine Learning and various use cases around it to kick their imagination and implement ML in their business.
Out of date, too abstract and Google focused (well it is offered by Google). Does not fill in gaps well. But a good introduction to Google's paid Cloud Platform.
It had excellent professor & teaching style was very nice. but the quicklabs was very slow it take more time to load and also show it required high internet
Good course, but too oriented to the use of google cloud, I would have liked to see more applicable technical information without the need for such a tool.
It's not what I want to learn and it's kind of boring. Also, I have no idea how to unenroll this course, the three grey dots only showing "rate course"
The course has good content but few practical excercises. was promizing but it would have being better having more quicklabs activities.
you did not cover how to actually use whole ml like  how to acquire data and how to go for visualization of data but all over is nice.
Some very good info, but I feel the content could be more interesting.  Suggest more narrative on context and more exciting examples.
Not easy to understand at all. Not recommended for beginners in machine learning/data science or the programming world.
First half of the course is fantastic. Second half is just videos. I feel like they rushed putting this together.
The first and last instructors were good, the second instructor was extremely slow and lacked conviction
Quite informative about the google ML services and the mindset behind using AI for business.
Good course but could be better if the presented use cases had been a little bit more deep.
Things are pretty basic, was looking forward to more technical and solid knowledge.
Understood a little of machine learning in professional business
between week 2 to 3 ,It's a little bit difficult to understand.
Many time not able to work on google tools
More Practicals will be helpful
To much general
NOT TOO USEFUL
extremely good
This course is very good for someone who wants to just get a feeling of how machine learning can be used in different scenarios and how to get a hang of some of the machine learning tools without explicit coding knowledge. But before doing this course I would suggest everyone to go through AI for everyone course by Andrew Ng. After that course, this course will look a lot more approachable.
Last week was not very interesting & could have been better
This would be a 3.75 star :) Happy about some aspects of this course but then also expected more detail in other areas. Overall I think you're better off having some other basic ML exposure before doing this. The labs do expose you to Google Cloud ML toolkits. But frankly the "labs" aren't really labs as much as a series of click-thru steps to be followed. Feels like driving only with training wheels rather than actually testing any understanding. Since these Google Cloud ML areas are quite complex so they would have to spend a lot more time on the Lab setups to make these really Labs to learn from. Personally I would have been okay if a lab took 4-6 hours but really made us go through some of the details of "WHY" we are going through those steps rather than simply stepping through.The areas on Bias and Fairness are quite good in terms of making you think. Overall good started package. Some links on what to explore deeper in each area would also have been useful.
Great Course, well worth the time and the paid version to get access to exercises really enriches it. Who Should attend: If you are a business leader with a cynical or confused view on how machine learning could possibly bring value to your business then this course is perfect. It clears away a lot of the crap that SaaS and other IT firms have put out in their marketing and gets to the underlying benefits for you. Beware: The busines side of things is buried in amongst some techincal concepts. this might appear 'pointless' but you really will struggle to fully appreciate the possible use cases without at least getting your feet wet on the technical. Best Approach: buy the certificate version and follow the tech exercises. They are very well structured and easy to do. Don't worry about remembering how to do things, just let the principles wash over you.
The lectures are really good and inspired me to think creatively as to the application of the ML into my business. However i found the working activities slightly complicated considering i have no formal ML or systems training. The instructions (IMO) need to be a little more dumbed down. Some of the apps dont match up to the course material from a UI persperctive possibly due to updates but i eventually figured it out. The Pacing was great and i enjoyed how succint the lecturers were and avoid repetition (i find some other courses use too many of the same examples for a point) The SQL sections completely threw me off (i do not have any SQL backround) which was the only activity i felt uncomfortable doing not really understanding how the scripts perform and.Other than that, great course. I finished early as i was so intrigued by each module
This is great for me to understand the concept of the Machine Learning. The use cases are eye-opening, but a few of them are too general (yes, the Fast Retailing). The first lab (pizza robot) is very fun, not so much in the next two. The reason was that I do not quite understand how does the photo recolonization and big query work, so the lab experience felt like following guide and clicking the button. I will, however, redo those exercises once I have more acknowledge about technical side of ML. The quiz about identifying proper business problem for ML does not provided any explanation, and it did not help me learning. Last but not least, the sections about bias and fairness are fantastic! It really makes me think about our responsibility when using ML. Wonderful materials for non-technical users like me. Thank you!
Overall, the course is a very comprehensive course. It provides a good overview of various machine learning principles from a business standpoint. However, the course material can be improved a bit and my suggestions are given below.The lab material is old and outdated for some of the labs. It might be good if the instructors can update the same. Also in a few videos, the teaching staff mentions about additional resources, but they aren't available within the course. So would request you to either provide those resources or edit the videos accordingly.
I've taken a similar Amazon (AWS) course before, and should say that this Google's course is much better suited for the beginners. AI and ML are explained in relatively understandable terms, with good real-life examples. At the very least, I now have a structure in my mind that can be accessed whenever a discussion on ML in professional settings is taking place. Some parts of the course (especially the last lab) were way above the grade of the purported target audience - I think, Google might revise them for better comprehension.
This is a great class for those looking for fundamentals of machine learning. If you already have ML experience or currently use Big Data at your company, you may find large parts of the course redundant. The labs are also quite easy and require little to no independent effort as the instructions tell you exactly what to do and write. This is a beginners class for business professionals, not intermediate or advanced. But fantastic if that's what you're looking for.
This course has been designed for the beginners in machine learning. Theory is very important to understand the basics and idea of machine learning, which is existing from quite a long time by now. This course gives you a systematic understanding of components of ML with current real life examples. This program has been explained so elegantly by some of head experts in google. Thank you for giving a real good start for my journey of learning ML.
Foi muito importante para contextualizar a utiliza√ß√£o do ML,
como a esta ferramenta pode ser aplicado nos neg√≥cios e como deve ser gerida.Foi tamb√©m importante para perceber em que √°reas nos devemos
especializar e como tirar partido da riqueza em dados que a empresa possui e que
n√£o est√° a ser usada.Gostava que o curso tivesse mais tempo dedicado a
explicar os modelos de AutoML que existem e sua aplicabilidade pr√°tica.
Very helpful to get a great overview of all the aspects related to applying ML in a business setting.This was not a technical course at all as they clearly tell at the very start. However, I think it would be useful to explain a little bit more technicality in the How ML works module to give a better intuition of what happens to the students who may end up taking this as their first ML course ever.
It's great course for a business professional who is in any strategic planing and managerial post to think out of the box. Help them collecting organized and necessary data and utilize this data by feeding into ML model to predict their customers behavior and other associative environments of business. More over, it will help to accelerate the business through the prospect of ML.
Great, non-technical course on Machine Learning providing inspiring use cases, a high-level framework for managers who are seeking to hire people in their Data Science team and getting to explore interesting tools developed by Google and its partners in the field of Machine Learning. No prior coding experience necessary, since it's not the subject of this course.
Overall, a well-structured course providing a good overview of ML and Google Cloud functionality, but occasionally felt like a sales pitch rather than a learning course. Quizes are not rigorous and look more like box-ticking exercise, so not very useful. Qwiklabs exercises and videos sometimes don't match, so update would be useful. Overall, time well spent.
This is a nice introduction to Google's Cloud Platform ML basic functionality. Additionally, they give you some intuitive understanding about the application of machine learning for business problems. The course is intended for business leaders, which need an overview over functionalities and potentials for technology application and decision making.
Very good introduction of ML For non developers, I guess it‚Äôs the only course around helping people understand what ML is and how it can be used in business without throwing you Into a loop of insane amount of math And statistics.Some exercises can be better explained or clarified, especially the BQML lab, there is no real explanation to it
The course provided an insightful introduction to machine learning. It was inspiring to recognize the importance of domain expertise in reaping maximum benefit from ML models. It triggered my imagination on possible use cases in my own line of work, and how data management could be improved to allow ML to add more value in the future.
A good course with just the right amount of topics required for business professionals to understand the nuances of Machine Learning. The course talks a lot about the principles and processes involved in moving towards building a Machine Learning model. I enjoyed the Bot creation bit. Will surely give it a try post the course !
The course was interesting and helped me get a basic introduction to machine learning. I found the course material interesting and the presenters did their best to be engaged with the viewers. The quizzes could have been more rigorous. They did not serve the purpose of testing your understanding of the principles.
Good introduction to ML for novices. However, certain concepts such as Data lakes, data warehouses and transition methodologies could have been covered more deliberately. Also would have loved if information was provided for Step by Step building an ML model/ application from a non-technical perspective.
Very useful for technical and business professionals who are looking to upgrade their knowledge to keep up with latest technical developments and introduction to open source platforms created by Google for seamless integration of machine learning and streamlining of business units and processes.
Interesting course from management perspective. Labs are pretty short and not that useful though without adding much to the topics discussed. Since I work on the more technical side, it was useful to try to see my work from my boss' perspectives and how they think about it vs how I would.
The course served a purpose of helping me understand the concepts of machine learning and triggered some thinking in terms of its applicability to the real world. The instructors did a great job with presenting real life examples and helping us think about the power f this technology.
This has widened by ML thought process by not only focus on the problem but other important aspects that need to be taken care of. Good balance of theoretical and practical training sessions(on Qwiklabs). Google's BigQuery and AutoML are very easy to tackle ML problems. Thank You
As a ML Product Manager, this was a helpful introductory course to discover ML use cases, prerequisites to ML  models, data strategy, several ways of labeling, and fostering an innovative culture in an organization. Many thanks to Coursera and Google for putting this together.
Great course. It not only covers ML to great extent but also talks about responsible AI/ML and importance of data governance. Lak and valentine were simply awesome , they made concepts easy to understand. hands on helped to get real feel of application.
as a beginner, where can I design machine learning model at local as well as corporate level, is still confusing. Many tools were shown which were good. However. where to get all such data for analysis is not shown, so it might be added in next course.
Exceptionally complete and outstanding summary of learning algorithms used currently and globally in software industry. Professor with great charisma as well as patient and clear in his teaching.  GCP is one of the best platform to practice your skill.
Good Overview for Business Professionals with no or only limited technical background. Shows you what is already out there and how some competitors might be using ML already. Obviously very Google product oriented. Teachers were very likeable.
The Course is very Good To Get Started and to get Understanding,Must for who are new to ML and want to know how to apply it into business From Scratch To End to End,from Single to Many Model in a continues integrated Pipeline ! and Much More.
It was a little bit hard for me to get all information from this course. But I really enjoyed examples of cases of ML and also I liked challenges that I have to complete. Thank you for this course because I understand a little more about ML.
El curso esta muy bueno porque est√° orientado a la practica de casos reales, pero al mismo tiempo hace poca referencia a los modelos de ML en s√≠ por estar completamente enfocado a las aplicaciones ML desarrolladas por google.
Great overview of Machine Learning with practical examples and applications, easy to understand hands-on tutorials on Big Query ML, Vision API etc. Smooth and easy style of course content delivery from the Google instructors
Excellent course for business professionals to get hands-on training on some ML tools. The course presents various use cases for ML across industries and helps you think in terms of how it can be applied in your business.
I really appreciate Google team to create this course. Being from a Medicine background I would love to come across course which focuses on innovative ways to apply Machine learning into Healthcare or research. ThankYou!
Very informative and categorized so effectively to understand everything in a systematic way ,I  gave 4 star as I did not liked  all of the 3 instructors as their way of teaching was not pleasing and was quite boring.
it is great for an overview and to understand the use cases broadly but a deeper dive is required to be able to start doing small data based project. all activities were super fun! thanks to the team and to coursera!
Although the course was nice and They also provides practicals too.But it is complicated to understand that course belongs to non technical background. I belongs to technical Background and it was beneficial for me.
Overall provides a comprehensive view of Machine learning applications for business. More case work can be added for practice. In some of the cases there were bugs which resulted in unable to move forward.
Absolutely Stunning Structure of Machine Learning Course for BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL. As a machine learning developer, I learn so many new stuffs in this course. Must do for any data science aspirants !!!
Great for understanding the fundamentals of Machine Learning and its applicability. Hands-on learning provided in guided sessions within Google's Cloud Platform. No prior coding knowledge is required.
I liked the course. Maybe a few more labs to understand google machine learning tools could be a big improvement. An introduction to most of the google machine learning cloud solutions would be a plus
The course provides context to Machine learning for the newbies in the best form it can!The hands-on experience it provides with various tools makes you feel equally involved in the course
This course is very good for technical as well as non-technical teams. This course is one step ahead then just coding course. Thank you all of you to be given a great course from Coursera.
Could have been better with several real time scenarios - labs were not working as per given instructions. the query said no object found. Conceptual is good, but too much of talking.
Very specific and understandable course with good lab practices and resources. glad to complete this course. highly recommended for machine learniners and business professional
The last assignment was not very good,It was prompting me to copy and paste everyting. Otherwise the course is really goo to get strted with ml and how it can be used scenarios
Excellent course! Meticulously crafted. Whatever was promised at the beginning of the course was appropriately delivered. The myth about ML is now gone! Thanks to Google team.
Being an engineer, i always wanted to learn M.L and wanted to how all these stuff works, by this course i got to know the overview of how ML is useful and got to do many work.
Generally the course provides a good overview. I would appreciate if some criteria were outlined clearer (in form of concise checklists for example). Thanks for your work!
The course is beneficiary for the working professionals. The course properly covered the topics with examples. I have learned ML with Lab experience. Thanks to Coursera.
Helpful class to get understanding on how ML is applied in google cloud platform along with real life use cases of implementation of ML in leading industries.
The course was useful to understand what is machine learning and how can we integrate in our profession to increase efficiency of employee and organization.
Requiere mas practicas y un par de semanas mas para poder disfrutar del mismo y desarrollar mas los temas, en si un gran curso que puede ser aun mas grande
The course was a really nice opportunity to get to know more about Machine Learning, specially through real-life examples. Thank you for this opportunity!
More precise cases in manufacturing Industry across 3 segments Big/Medium/small  basis applicability of application of ML would have been more useful
Really good overview for beginners and Google as such is really informative in the work they do. Thanks alot to google for making such great courses
Very Interesting course with very useful labs that give you hands-on exposure to Google Cloud Platform tools. The mini quizzes were scored weirdly.
Good, its a foundation course, gives good idea and overview of machine learning. Google API which can be used to achieve machine learning goals.
the course was fantastic it really interesting though some videos are cracking, you guys can checkout for corrections. Thanks COURSERA AND GCP.
Boleto Ek Dam Zakhass. This course really help me to understand the professional stuff that a business need with the help of Machine learning.
I think this is a great course for anyone that needs to define an ML strategy for their company or as a consultant. Would definitely recommend
Absolute pleasure in learning this course. Highly recommended for all the business professionals who want to get a flavour of the ML world.
Interesting course. Opens the mind to ML capabilities and creative work. Also ensures to demonstrate best practices and ethical thinking.
This is really excellent course for Manager and Business consultant who wants to understand the basic of AI for new business opportunity.
I like the pace of the course and lab works.  It definitely helps to give insights on this topic.  I totally recommended this course.
It's good course but something I have trouble and can't using Qwiklabs. So please fix it. Thank you so much for your consideration.
Good course put together by Google Cloud giving an overview on Machine Learning and how it can be used in any kind of business
Really enjoyed the hands on labs in GCP with diagflow, bigquery etc. would love to have more hands on to experiement with GCP
IT was well explained but it would be better to give students the last updated version of tools during examples, Thank you
Very informative and easy way to understand it. Very effective lessons and hand on experience. Thank you very much .
Tr√®s instructif . Donne une vision √† la fois technologique et orient√©e Business des possibilit√©s offertes par le ML.
MORE QUICKLABS SHOULD BE INTRODUCED OR ADDED FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE REAL WORLD EXAMPELES SHOULD BE ADDED
Nice Initial source before diving into ML/AI applications using coding. Non-coders can pursue this course easily.
Good course, but need more essential language or training, such as the common functions and clause in BigQuery ML
Some very good concepts and very good introduction to ML. Would like to see more labs added to the course though.
Highly informative however the practical examples lacked depth to offer a meaningful learning opportunity in ML
this course gives a good understanding of Machine Learning for any person without any technological background.
Expecting something details or more precise! although good for beginner. Need to update the resource section.
The course covers the material and is well structured, easy to follow and to complete - at times a bit slow.
The course gives new very interesting points of view, very impressive examples, and entertaining activities
Great introductory course almost touching all aspects of ML for BAs and Engineers as well. Good job google
A good introductory course to ML and how it can be applied to business cases for non-technical people.
The qwiklabs need to be1 - longer2 - more qwiklabs assignments, for better familiarizing with the GCP
Good Course. Adding some more qwiklabs exercise would be much more interesting. Thank you Coursera!.
Very Good course, Thanks to coursera and the Google cloud for developing such a platform of learning
Good simple and practical course. Pushes me to explore more on data analysis and machine learning.
This is recommended to anyone who wants to understand scope and application of ML in business.
the course best describes how to apply machine learning techniques in the field of business
Overall nice course with good introduction about machine learning and its uses in business
It's useful course for especially who wants to deploy their ML models  in practical way
Awesome course for someone who wants to have an insight into AI ML for business purpose
it's great but it need more explanation on example application of ML to real life cases
Could use some more labwork. But good to help businesses understand applications of ML!
Great course for those wanting to learn Machine Learning without any prior background.
Some technicalities should be inclluded or more qwiklabs would be great for the course
Appericiate   your Time, Dedication and Patience to learn and implement new knowledge.
Recommend to provide then more technical content & concept explain wise is awesome.
Very comprehensive and to the point introduction to ML for business professionals.
A very good learning experience. All the trainers are very knowledgeable. thanks
Awesome course on ML from Google Cloud Training with a right mix of lab sessions
This is a nice course where i have learnt how to apply my machine learning skill
I think the exercises were cute but ultimately did not add much to the course.
great course, useful labs. One imporvement: the last trainer is way too slow
The course provided a good overview of machine learning using Google tools
Nice intro to ML and a good way to understand the dynamics and buzz words!
Very informative for those curious about Machine Learning as a discipline
very nice and effective materialsome more practice lab shall be included
It was a wonderful course. Hopefully it will help me in my recent future
Very good course, but the dialog flow module of google was kind of buggy
Some lab material need to further update, but overall, nice experience!
Great introduction to ML and the various business application for it.
Definitely the best.I know how to make a proper chatbot.Thank-you...
I found the course very interesting, with a good hands on approach
The concepts are very very clear and the labs are very practical.
Preety Decent start to learn about Machine Learning Fundamentals.
Gives you a good understanding of ML from a business perspective

Nice Learnig Platform
best way of learning
Practical and useful
Nice for a beginner!
Thank you for course
I Love this Course,
it is informative.
Well made course
nice material.
comprehensive
A bit hard
No comment
Meticulously planned course. Since it is Google developed training so will be helpful for improving the application of ML with Google technologies. I like the QwikLabs to give some hands on.
Concise overview of what ML is and what it might be used for  with brief, but good intro to GCP tools.  Not very deep technically, but this is by design.  Instead, it covers some important points that some more technical courses skip past, that are important for a successful ML project in your company.
This was really good, not much technical which would have been difficult to understand, learned to create a chatbot, labeling images, playing with business data, those were really fun.
An excellent course to understand the multiple use cases of Machine learning along with 3 Labs for hands-on training,that too,without any coding :-).One of the best courses available on Coursera.
Very interesting course for non-technicals, with experience and case studies across the course and more importantly, with practice on Google Cloud different tools.
The course material and coverage is very good and vast. It covers a lot of good use cases from different kind of industries.
This is one of the best online courses I have ever taken, it was easy to go through and I feel like I learnt so much.  The information was just enough to trigger curiosity and keep me motivated.  Access to GCP labs and playing around was awesome, it was more than you could bargain for the fees.  The Quiz weren't that challenging except the one in Week #1.  It would be great I can continue to have access the material so I can further reinforce the information I learned by reviewing them again.  Thanks for making the learning easy.-Phane Rao
Amazing Course. I was really Awestruck with this course. Because I am not from Computing Domain, but I changed my view of Computing domain after this course, I wish I had attend such course a decade ago, which would have changed my career path. Now I realize why Google is Unique and Different. Google is Class Act, Set Apart, Unique. I will be praying if God willing, would like to Join Google in the future, and be with that creative Environment. Thank you Google for Providing me an Opportunity to take this course.
Este curso es una obligaci√≥n si es que quieres entender TODO lo que implica ocupar el aprendizaje autom√°tico (ML) en el mundo del Data Science. Gracias a √©l ahora pude entender qu√© es lo que piden las empresas hoy en d√≠a y qu√© camino quiero seguir como profesional, esto pues cuando ingreses a este curso sabr√°s diferencias fundamentales entre los diferentes cargos de an√°lisis de datos que las empresas solicitan hoy en d√≠a (y por qu√© lo hacen).Me encant√≥. Muchas gracias por hacer este curso.
I really like the course, I have suggested some minor updates and I believe the Bias should be explained more since they can be a bit tricky to understand, but it was the course that I was looking for years since most of them are either too technical or the lack of certain statistical or mathematical information in my case, it made impossible to jump on it! But now, I'm thinking how to use ML for a PhD.
Apt level of coverage for business professionals and project managers. There were few advertisements for the google training which can be minimised by just referring and not going too much in detail.
great course really like Lak's explanation
This is a great course for non-technical professionals looking to understand Machine Learning. The course gives a brief overview of Machine Learning and the importance of data, the recommended project flow for projects that might include ML, as well as opportunities where ML might be used. Google Cloud also provides time for lab exercises where you can play around with Google products and open-source projects that use ML. This course caters well to software Project Managers, Product Owners, Marketing Professionals, etc. who might have ML or AI projects in the future.The only downside to this course is that the lab instructions can be unclear at times, and some exercise instructions have not been updated to reflect changes to the lab software. Still, the lab opportunities are a good way to understand ML applications in general.
This course was a fantastic introduction in the world of ML. Very down to earth examples, recommendations and insights. The course material (videos, readings, hands-on lab) was executed in a brilliant way - and even more, the information provided was crisp and sharp. But what I liked even more was the enthusiasm the presenters showed in the videos - they embrace their domain and you could feel the passion while listening to them. I also really liked the fact, that google highlighted topics like governance and change management that at first sight have nothing to do with introducing ML - but now I know!
High quality instructors and well-designed topics.My background is data analysis with traditional stats training.  The course connected the dots for me between hypotheses testing/deductive reasoning vs. dots to pattern inductive reasoning.  It also puts ML in its place by illustrating that ML is not everything, it has to be supported by quality data.  BQML democratized ML.  The team composition showed the need for different skill sets working together.The course exceeded  my expectations - well done!
Fantastic course which really enlightens one on the possibilities and perhaps even the simplicity of execution with knowledge of the right tools. This course empowers Business Leaders to acquire the requisite knowledge to understand what they do not need to invest in and where to allocate their time and valuable resources. Strongly recommend to C Suite professionals to re-imagine their businesses, using their innate domain knowledge and the insights provided by this course.
The course is very good for business professionals with a little knowledge of machine learning and coding experience. However, it can be too easy for people with experience in ML. All projects are using Google Cloud products so you are expected to use those because it is simple click-wise operation and ready to deploy. Your bosses and managers should take this course to get to know ML and start to implement it into your business.
Simple and practical course to get you started with ML for your business. As expected, all tools used in this course are from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It touched several different topics, including ML for Image recognition, natural language processing, big data prediction, etc. A complete course for people who want to not only understand ML more, but also get a hands-on experience with ML tools!
Introduces very good foundational concepts that are essential for businesses to see through the smokes of the related marketing hype of machine learning. This course provides principles on which to make business decisions on how  to approach machine learning from a practical perspective, the various implementation considerations, and the caveats to keep in mind of unintended consequences.
This is an excellent ML course for business professionals who don't want to get deep in the subject, or as an introduction to someone who wishes to know more about the field. It is very practical and shows how Google tools can help you solve problems you may have in your company, or even improve. Extra star for the What if Tool, for me just learning about it was worth taking the course.
It‚Äôs been both entertaining and inspiring becoming more
familiar with AI technology, exploring ML use cases for solving real-life
business problems, learning strategies for successfully formulating, training
and deploying ML projects and getting some hands-on experience by using Google
Qwiklabs (particularly, I loved the building-your-own pizza order chatbot exercise
using Dialogflow).
The content of this course is really good and covers all topics related to successfully apply ML solutions to any business problems. It covers topics from identifying the business problem which can be solved using ML to Data Collection and cleansing to apply an appropriate ML technique. The labs helps to get practical insight using Google ML solution on Google cloud.
Excellent course to give us an idea of how machine learning works, how to set up machine learning teams within your company, how to identify potential use cases in your business and the importance of sensitive data governance. I feel much more comfortable with machine learning concepts now and ready to pursue a more technical course. Highly recommended!
I had no idea about the subject before i started this program. But when i finished, i feel i need to more. I am more excited, enthusiastic to learn more about AI, ML & DL. These will be the future of business and must learn for each business guy.Most importantly, i now know, why i couldnt crack the 2 important interviews i gave in past 2 months. :)
Thank you for putting together this course. It is very well structured with a slow start that then picks up pace to address many relevant topics for ML. As a Product Manager, I found it very well suited for me to start in this area and to build good basic understanding. A lot of practical insights, knowledge and hand-on exercises. Thank you a lot!
Excelente contenido que permite comprender los beneficios que pueden obtenerse de la aplicaci√≥n de Machine Learning en las empresas. La importancia que marcan a la democratizaci√≥n del Machine Learning va en l√≠nea con las tendencias de implementaci√≥n de no requerir de personal PhD / altamente especializado que se viene para los a√±os 2020 a 2030.
One of the best techno-functional courses on ML with the right balance of Use Cases and Lab exercises. The clarity and level of detail vs abstraction is very meticulously achieved throughout the course. I strongly recommend this course for Business Analysts, Product Managers - to get a 360 view of ML as a core discipline of data science.
This course is really thoughtful for any data engineer who wants to learn about ML, think about ML and definitely a must for any business who wants to venture there needs and focus on improving the business using Machine Learning models. I thoroughly enjoyed learning this course. Thanks to Coursera and GCP for making this one.
This course has really given me a better insight into where it is appropriate to apply machine learning and where it is not appropriate to do so. The Lab sessions are very useful for a beginner to familiarize him or herself with cloud computing techniques. Kudos to the team of instructors. They have all delivered so well
This is one of the most exiting course out there, I was working with ML. But this course didn't talk about the traditional ML tools rather Google API, one might actually use in practical. For the practicality and based course content I am very satisfied with this. I will recommend it to anyone. Hats off to the team.
This course opened my mind about ML, showed me that an ML project could be more complex than one would think it is, and also more simple in other aspects like the execution of it. The course made me think about a lot of situations where I can use ML to improve the user experience or the efficiency in every business.
This is the most fun course I completed.Learn what ML is and its characteristics  and further refine ML as predictive analytics. Also, gain knowledge on use cases and how it helps your business further their success.Labs were particularly fun. My fav was creating a Pizza ordering Chatbot with Dialogflow API.
Well presented material with meaningful examples. I was able to review topics multiple times when needed and quickly progress when I understood sooner. I would have preferred more hands on examples but that is a personal preference and does not diminish the value. This was a very good investment of my time.
Useful content presented on an organized and illustrative way.  The labs were interesting and added excellent hands-on practice to the theory.  The course is well balanced between the technical and business aspects and the provided examples strengthen understanding.  It was definitely a good investment.
This is a great course for beginners who learn Machine Learning in a better way.From this course I have learnt about important of Machine Learning how this tool is important for our business as well as I have learnt about data and its Important because " Everything is Stated With Data " .Thankyou!!!!
This really helps put business dynamics and ML concepts in perfect alignment; to an extent that a clarity of thought is achieved. If you want to gear up towards jumping from your world of Dashboards, reports powered by in BI to a new frontier of ML and AI, then this course is perfect place to start.
It is very great course and I am able to understand it properly. Since I was a beginner to ML it was little bit complicated but this course give me a broad view on ML and its use cases. The mentors of this course where also great in teaching. But I will such this course to only Non-Technical one's.
Highly recommend this ML for Business Professionals to those who are looking to start their career in AI or who have the fortune to find themselves in the business of AI and need reinforcement to what they are learning in the field. Stick with this course and you'll definitely reap the benefits.
Great course, I was zero before the start of the course ,but as the course start i learnt many things AutoMl,Vision Api ,the good use of data,how to get data and clear and fairness of data ,How yo use machine learning for better use , This course is a blast , Thanks to Google and Coursera.üëç
Very useful, provided fantastic overview of ML, use cases and how to approach the concept. The most useful input I gained was about how ML is accessible, and with the right approach and targeted skilling, an organization does not require onboarding of specialists to execute an ML project.
