Most of this information is just an introduction and promo for PWC. Cut the material down and incorporate it into the other classes of this specialization. As a stand alone class I don't see the value of the course.
Total loss of time.Why do you call this course Data driven decision making once "Remember you do not have to conduct actual data analysis, you only have to outline your plan."  ?Where is decision making? 4 weeks of PwC promo with 0 REAL PRACTICAL aplication! Just call this couse "Buy PwC services" or "Join the team of talkers"?Adios Coursera... I was expecting more.
Basically this course was an excellent promotion of PwC as a consultant. A well crafted introduction of buzz-words with very little substance (Unlike the following courses on Excel and presentations)
Disappointing.  Just brushed the surface of most of the topics, felt a bit too much like an ad for PWC or story telling about client engagements.  Content was lacking
This is not a course. It is a big fat ad.
Content marketing for pwc instead of an actual course
Too much theory, no practice. Blah-blah-bla
More of a webinar than a course.
it sucks
The reason why I am giving only one star  that the course did not covered much information and the time allotted could have been less than 4 weeks. So it was not really worth the money.
Course just for PwC internal purposes. Does not give real value for money because most of the students are participating for free (PwC employees)
Waaaay too many recruiting / client pitches / kool aid. I could have edited the course down 50% and learned the same amount.
very boring lectures. expected a lot more from something like PWC. Doesn't worth it at all. Didn't learn anything new.
How can a course with so many details tell you nothing at all !?!? What a complete waste of time!
take this course if you want a job with PWC, but there isn't much
Very low level content. No strategies or actionable lessons.
very little useful information, more like PR for PWC
non-practical course, concepts are only mentioned
Too much useless introductions.
empty talk, no content.
superficial
Had to re-enrol after failing the final peer review, not because the work was poor but because there is NO assessment criteria to go on. You just wing it. So ok I pay again - repeat the peer review - no feedback on the grade - have to re-enrol again - $71 later the message is my grade will be ready on Jan 16. What a rip off.
This is a general introduction with no practical applications or exercises in decision making. The instructors look like more stock actors from an infomercial with the personality of white bread.
Peer Reviewed Assignment not a well planned marking system. Grades can be to vary. Dependent on fellow students for pass not most ideal.
Blatantly unfair and subjective. Also, rubric doens't match the questions. The only good news: I learned some stuff.
Pathetic n hopeless.no tools on data analysis, only shallow talk about the importance f data analysis
Boring course, with little contents and lots of catch phrases.Most of it is PwC advertisement.
Boring lectures. No applyable content.
big words but very few substance
i want to unroll
Positive is that this course gives you basic understanding of data analysis. 2 weeks of this course went quite okay, although I noticed in the first week already that presenters are reading what they are saying. The third week is SO boring and I cannot wait for this course to end. I can say for me it's the most expensive and the most boring course on coursera so far. I tried several courses here and none of them was so bad. Honestly, I expected more from this one as it's PWC but honestly it seems to me like 'Yeah, let's read some paragraphs from fancy lectures and books and make some money of it'.
Its a basic and fast overview of big-data and some various tools. You don't really "apply" anything, just listen and read. This could have been a white-paper with short video accompanying. There were a mash-up of corporate sales and on-boarding videos that felt disjoint with the learning goals. The information is freely available on the web. I'm not clear on the added value in this MOOC.
Sounds more like soft sale of their services. No digging into real-life examples enough, they've given a brief overview of how they solved some real-life problem but without any details (similar to their web site). It is only mentioned types of analysis and tool without giving example of how that works in real-life. Could be much better...
Peer review is too slow on the final assignment. This drags out Coursera subscription, and the expectations on how to write the final assignment are not well defined. I give this course -2 stars for this reason. Otherwise it would be a 4/5 for a good introduction into business data analysis.
Gives a very high level overview of data analysis used in industry. This coursespecialization's discussion forums are not moderated by PwC people so you won't glean insight into how PwC folks handled specific situations.
This particular course was not worth the money. Lots of advertisement to work for PwC, not a lot of new ideas or new skillsets learned. I would recommend skipping this section.
Touched on some interesting topics, but not very practical. Course mentions data analytics technology (SAS, Tableau, Python), but you don't actually use any of the technology.
Very basic course and for me it's still a question why finishing the course in 5 days you need to pay for several month of subscription...
This course teaches you how to talk in an educated way about technology without really teaching you anything at all.
No concrete things.Water, water, water.I was able to answer the quizes without watching videos. 100% result.
Personally I found this course a PWC marketing strategy, nothing more. I am disappointed
Good for beginner but this course can be completed in 2 weeks rather than 4 weeks.
The course is well done and well structured, however it's too theoretical.
Too basic. Nothing special to gain. I had very high expectations from PWC
Too marketing orientated for PWC. I paid for a course not a promotion.
course is way too theoretical and a kind of overview of data analysis.
I think the course taught me more about PWC than anything else.
Too simplistic iapproach to analytics.
Not very useful in practical sense
Too high level the course is.
This course is all theoretical knowledge, nothing about real practice on analyzing tools. If you want to learn how to use tools, go to some other courses.
The overall course is pretty nice but there are things that tend to become annoying along the way: (a) on the videos, please delete the 10-second introduction ; (b) I understand the promotion objective of the course for PwC but there are too much about the opportunities there, etc. On the matter, one video and a small article would be more than enough ; (c) the concrete tools are surrounded by videos which only give an overview of data analytics. I'd rather suggest to write a small article to give an overview of why data analytics is important into our world today but please, use the videos to bring concrete and actionable content.
This course is not really what I was looking for. It was very gerenal and providing only a big picture of what data management is. It touched a bit about the names of software or systems for different purposes, also provided a categrization of approaches/methods for data analysis, but all in very general and high level sense. I feel this course is more for CEO level managers to have an idea, but not really instructing about real skills. I will not recommend this course if you are trying to find some in-detail insturciton about decision making process.
The course content is predominantly high-level and unspecific and gives an brief overview of data analysis tools that would only be new in case of no prior knowledge in the spheres involving data analysis. I would suggest devoting more content in the course to specific types of data, as well as specific data analytics frameworks and techniques.The final project was rather ambiguous as there were little to no guidelines with respect to how to complete it. The case study required to provide detailed answers regarding the analysis, however, the sample cases did not provide much detail that would be adequate to answer some of the test questions (e.g. questions regarding achieved insights, insight-based recommendations etc.).
This course is a good introduction to how companies analyze and visualize data. I didn't always feel like the course material gave me a real understanding of the topics and the tests don't have versions or any explanation of incorrect answers--but you can take them many times--so they can sometimes be more of a guessing game than effective tests of knowledge or understanding. This course would be improved by more meaningful discussion topics (I sometimes skipped these because they didn't feel meaningful), more practice questions or simulations, and more refined case studies (with perhaps some guiding multiple choice before the open-ended final assignment).
i would not recommend this course to people who have more than 3 years of experience in finance or data analysis, it is too much theory that are based on "Commonsense" and is not practical. However, I would think it will be helpful for college students or people who have no idea about data analysis at all and this will be a good starting point. Another comment is: since PWC is a professional services firm, they are very different in presenting the materials vs a real college professor---for me, it is a bit too "professional" and lack the atmosphere of a study group.
This course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more. However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...not to mention too heavy on the PWC pitches. The quizzes and assignments don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignments are structured poorly. Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious learners.
The course is extremely helpful and the content is good. However, it is hard sometimes to follow the Principals/Directors teaching the course. Additionally, it would have been fantastic if a lot of time was spent on giving examples, practical work demonstrated and a thorough structure of how it was done.Maybe, all this will be coming in the future courses. But for beginners, it is hard to understand and catch interest on the topic if not discussed with detailed examples and not merely giving highlights on the examples.
Most of the useful content is during the last week of the course, when you work on a project. However, concepts such as creating a hypothesis/es are not fully introduced and may be confusing for those who do not already have some training in scientific method or statistical method (e.g., knowing what a null hypothesis is). The simulation was also not useful, and contains a lot of jargon. Most of the content in the first part of the course is blue sky jargon discourse about Big Data, and can probably be skipped.
This course cover the concepts and aspects of analysis very well.However,regarding the final week assignment I feel that,it can be an overwhelming challenge for those who do not have any business related background.I am an Engineering graduate and hence couldn't understand some of concepts related to making business decisions,as they were not taught in the course.Other than that the overall Data Analytics industry and careers exposure were pretty well explained and informed.
I personally found this course a good start for those new into the data-driven world, although there are three potential points for developmenta) as most of the IT-related stuff it is getting outdated very quickly so this should be taken into consideration when talking about tools and systemsb)  not enough information on data visualization principles which are VERY important (more than data themselves)c) I'd also link this course to other courses e.g. on machine learning
This is a fairly high-level look into data and analytics, and mainly approaches this topic from a business angle albeit it would have been nice to go a little more into the analytic side of things before getting into the deep end in the second course in this specialization. The quizzes were overly easy, and the simulation final was really cool. The final peer assessment wasn't challenging enough relative to my expectations.
It is well structured, it comes from practice and there are very competent speakers.But there is a lot of self-marketing for PWC sometimes it feels more like an PWC ad, but teaching you something. And it's too superficial. I miss i.a. explanations and samples of the types of analysis (regression, factor, mutivariant, ...)  and I miss more detailled explanations and show cases from the tools like QlikView, Tableau, ...
Very general overview, not really teaching specific techniques or approaches. It gives names of analyis tools and methods, so you know what to google, - i find that useful. However, it's mostly general and rather superficial information about how important is data and that companies should collect and analyze data, visualize results and take decisions based on the analysis.
A good foundation course. I believe the information regarding tools and techniques could've been presented in a better manner by working on live files and displaying it. It was monotonous. Apart from the rest, the final course case studies were brilliant and helped us to collaborate our understanding of the course.
The course gives deep insights into the importance of Data and Data analytics in the world of Business decisions and strategy. However, the course is extremely theoretical and doesn't involve a lot of practical exposure. At times, it just seems as a PR exercise by PWC.
Interesting overview of PWC's methodology of data-driven decision making. I found the descriptions of the processes and the tools utilized to be very superficial. I also found the guidance and grading rubric for the final 'peer-reviewed' project to be weak and unclear.
The last 2 weeks of the course were great. I really enjoyed the simulation and the project. It would have been great to have had some more practical work earlier in the course as the first 2 weeks read somewhat like an advertisement for PWC data consultancy.
I enjoyed this introductionary course to data and analytics. Thanks for the provided knowledge and materials PWC. Personally I found the level of difficulty too easy for an academic. I would also prefer less promotion about PWC in many of the video's.
Overall, this is a good course. It provides many handy tools, frameworks, techniques for data-driven decision making process. It does improve my decision making skill. However, the course is quite short and doesn't have much in-depth content.
I know it is an introductory course, but there was not much that I feel like i learned from this course other than a bunch of vocabulary words. I hope that there is more technical instruction in the  following courses in this sequence.
Good stuff in general, but from my personal point of view: a little bit too much of general info around what data is and can be used for (I know much of it already). I think, however, that the course is great for beginners.
Is too much of an overview. I'd like if they could make the course much bigger and actually practice what was learned more and go more in depth. I'm gonna forget the information in a month for sure.
Some interesting information in this course. Good overview of data and decision making. I like the breakdown of the data-decision making model.The Course is a bit too promotional of PWC.
The course talks about topics on a very abstract level and I expected it be comprehensive and detailed. As far as the delivery is concerned, I found it pretty nice and captivating.
Very high level. Lots of helpful information for those new to the data analytics space. I had hoped it would dive into more hands on learning of what to do once you have the data.
I wish they would not sell pwc so much in their presentations. It is too distracting. Also you don't get certificates. The assignments aren't reviewed on time so beware.
I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making. What I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overviews.
Good crash course. I really liked the framework and overview of types of analysis. I didn't like the shared case study qualities as such.
An informative course with a high level perspective and real life examples, suitable for beginners and senior executives.
The course is good for elementary understanding, th exercises were fun too. However, the tools could have been described
This course is good but it only has theories. Practical use of Excel or any other analytical tool should also be added
Really long PwC commercial. Had a few choice nuggets of information. Hearing the vocab a bunch was good.
It was good but quite basic with less real-time examples from different industries to explain the point.
very basic information ! The cost of the course is not justified for the content shared/displayed.
A little dry, but a good introduction of the theory that underpins the rest of the modules.
Too high level compared to what I expected, but does give a good overview of the topic.
Need to be more application based. But for a beginner its a good course.
Good demonstration of data analysis at a glance but that's all it is.
I was expecting in depth explanation of decision making. Thank you.
the rating was unfair and they did not provide efficient feedback
The final assignment was not marked fairly by other students.
Nice introductory overview of the application of analytics
We expected to learn pratical skills during this training
Could have been much shorter.. too much repetition.
GOOD COURSE BUT TOO THEORETICAL NOT DEEP ENOUGH
Demasiado teórico, poco práctico.
There are so much ads about PWC
extremely high level
overview was good
Overview is good
Very Theoretica
It was OK.
Explains Data Analytics and its basics in a really simple way. Also the simulation quiz and the peer graded assignments are worth a mention. P.s. A little more info. on the kind of questions in the Rubric test, would have probably helped me to formulate a better business plan, for the peer graded assignment.Best, Kinjal
The course is excellent but the idea of allowing peers to review your final assignment isn’t a fair deal. Peers are of different levels in their careers, language proficiency, understanding etc. Sometimes, they do not interpret the meaning of your written work but look for specific words you have used in your assignment expecting it to be an exact match as defined in the marking scheme. Sometimes they may not have the time to go through your work in detail but may just skim through the content and grade you based on personal opinion.
The course is helpful in providing a basic introduction to how data can drive better decision making in real business context. It provides a basic introduction to various tools and techniques. The best part is the final submission in 4th week which ensures learning from the entire course.A possible area of improvement is including more case study discussions during the course which help understand what kinds of tools and techniques should be used in which scenarios. Currently the course devotes very less time to this aspect.
The course is excellent because it gives the opportunity to interact and with other learners and see their work because it forces you to evaluate them and this helps to have a better insight of what you have learnt. What I most liked is that you decided the effort you want to put in the course and thus the learnings you will gain. Some videos are a bit boring and too general, I do not think there is high value in naming 10 different programs, tools or techniques, you easily forget their names and its too general.
This is a very interesting course, which gave me a brief idea about the data world! I love how different colleagues from PWC shared their perspectives, which helped me understand this organization and understand what you guys' daily life. The only thing that I would recommend would be to add more real-life examples. I understand it was not easy to share different examples in public. Maybe for me this will be a more visualized way to grow and learn fast. Again, thank you so much, the pwc team!
The lecture video is invincible, while the exam and peer review could have somewhat improve in terms of the interaction. Detailed explain will be helpful, since it can serve as a feedback for students to check whether they answer is really right or they simply answer at a guess. Peer review may require students write down suggestions. I take the business metrics from Duke Univ and they do have this section which I think help me reflects more on the case study.
This course is a general course about data-driven decision making, as you can guess from the syllabus.-It is a PwC course, you should expect PwC marketing content. Honestly, I didn't mind.-You hear real-life insights from PwC professionals about data-driven projects. Many case studies.-Recommend it to anyone who wants to start with a basic overview and get deeper with more in-depth courses.-If you have limited free time, this course is short!
This was a very useful course to get me updated with the meaning of modern data analytics, the concepts of the types of data that are relevant today, the tools that can be leveraged, and the possibilities to create a systemic solution to big  business challenges, instead of one-off analyses as we did in the past. I recommend these course to anyone who wants to gain an overall understanding on what  data and analytics means today
This course has a very high production value, and offers a fairly comprehensive introduction to the world of data, but sacrifices depth in exchange for breadth. Thus, unless you are entirely new to data work as it exists today, significant portions will be review. That said, filling in the foundations is crucial to building your understanding of more complex topics outside the course.
This course is a basic, high level introduction to data analytics.I feel like more simulations could have been provided for practice with analytic plans. Also, the rubric is not provided for the final project and your grade is dependent on reviews from peers and you may not receive feedback. But overall a great introductory course.
I really liked the material in this course! It was very helpful to gain a base understanding around big data and the potential insight and uses that come from tapping into it. In terms of the assignments and projects, I think the strategic approach to helping firms tap into insights from big data was a little bit vague.
Nice overview of the topic. I particularly like the analytical "Framework", the overarching method to keep in mind when asking and answering data-driven questions. It is a nice tool to keep you focused on results. I feel like it will help not only beginners, but help more experienced people sharpen their approach.
I was reluctant to take the course, but it was actually nice course easy to grasp and have a general overview about the concept of data and analysis. I liked the cases presented from PWC however they refer to cases quiet old (2013) so I wasn't sure whether similar approach is still being used now.
The course provides a lot of theoretical information on the topic. Without going into details, it gives an overall overview of the decision making process of the consultants. The final project is tailored to the course and gives an opportunity to get hands-on experience on the topic learned.
I loved the course overall, and I thought it was the right amount of information for an initial course in a subject. My only complaint is with the final project/peer review system. Full disclosure, this is my first experience with that, but I wish I had more of a heads up of what to expect.
Course content was excellent lecturers were great the only downside in my opinion was peer graded assignments.Assignments should be reviewed by professionals.A good idea would be to allocate these to PWC trainee team.This will enhance learning and will make reviews more appropriate,
For beginners it is really helpful. Liked the structure of the course and topics covered. I was able to apply things taught over 3 weeks to the final assignment. Would definitely recommend doing it if one is interested in knowing the fundamentals for Data-driven Decision Making.
Good introduction to the topic, provides a high level overview of data-analytics and visualisation and their importance in the work place. After this course I'm inspired to dive further into the field and looking forward to PwC's follow up courses in the specialisation.
A very good course by Coursera, it briefly discusses nearly all major concepts, current technologies and challenges in big data. The focus is on developing a basic understanding so that the students are able to improve decision-making by deploying appropriate tools.
Good overview of data analytics and how data can be used for decision-making. The pacing could be a bit better (slow on the front end and packs a lot of information into the last couple of weeks), but overall the information is good and helpful in many contexts.
It was very basic for the most part, there was also a lot of fluff. The best part was when they went over the major platforms such as SAS, Python, R, and VBA that was something new to me that I didn't know. The framework was also somewhat useful to know.
I don't find discussion assessment helpful, it's better to recommend more read/video/media sources instead of it. And final project is late to wait. Eventually the course is useful and helped me a lot to structure my thoughts. Thank you in advance!
The videos were nice. The final project was really innovative and helped us understand the business scenarios and how to apply our learnings in a very effective way. I am looking forward to detailed study on use of tools to achieve the same.
Nice learning opportunity for beginners. It is a great platform to understand the basics of Big data analytics. The pedagogy is very simple yet informative. The simulation and case project is a great way to test your learning.
great information , you can understand very well the Data Driven Decision making broadly with a lot of teaching videos , material and quiz.id like this course exam and final project its very challenge but ideal for learning
Course was good, covered wide variety of topics, and gave 10000 feet view of the data driven decision making process. It would have been better if there was a deep dive on one of the aspects of decision analysis framework
The course gives a good horizontal overview of the field, but maybe lacks some in-depth case study that applies the mentioned methodologies. Overall still is a great course and I would recommend it to anyone interested!
It started with quite a bit of theory but really enjoyed the later assignments and discussions. It really opened my mind as to the possibilities of data analytics especially from a accounting / finance point of view.
Course was informative and provide background about Data and Decisions based on Data Analysis. I would liked more detailed information for beginners reading data and interpreting data. However, overall satisfactory.
it says that I need to be active in helping people in this course,,,,hahaha, if you need me to review your assignment , just leave a message and your link , I'll review your assignment as soon as possible...🤝🍀
I enjoyed the course and thought the pace and content was excellent. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because I thought the case study criteria was not presented before the assignment was given.
Good course to learn how to begin with any raw data we receive. To get a rough idea on where to get the data from? how to use them? and what analysis can we use to derive at a particular decision.
Excellent course for beginners or currently professionals in the world of data management. Everything that we do generates data nowadays so I will recommend everyone to take this educative course.
Very good course, material is mostly well explained and laid out. Highly recommended!Some audio and captions mistakes here and there.Course glossary is not expensive enough and missing some terms
Good basic level understanding of analytics. It would have been better to have studied some of the analytical techniques by doing practical problems, to get a better grasp of how exactly does the
It is a good introduction to data analytics techniques and methodologies. However, I think there is over-repetition of basic points which undermines the more subtle, yet significant, points.
Very-well structured and very interesting course. I did not realise before that social media created data can bring insights and can be a useful source of data for business strategies.
I like it but don't know if I am dumb or it is too vague from my actual life I don't think I had the deeper understanding of this. However I did know the basic procedure and a picture
I was hoping for a deeper dive into the framework but it was still a very wothy course. Thank PwC for putting so much effort into the creation of this fantastic learning experience.
Good introduction to the world of data, analytics and big data.A bit too much PwC pitch. The chapter were the analysis techniques are explained could do with better examples.
Great class, well strucured with relevant content and illustrations. It's a great introduction on how useful data can be for companies and what are the most used tools.
Gives a Top view of the Data driven decision Making. Overall helps in developingg an appreciation and  helps one to navigate  on creating a Business Analytics Strategy.
I found this course well structured and covered many foundation principles of data analysis. Regular quizzes throughout assisted in retaining the information learned.
The simulation was very interesting, but there is a lot of theory leading up to that which was at times a bit overwhelming. Summary slides / videos would be helpful.
Great Course, thanks for PwC and Coursera. It contained frameworks, helpful background about making decisions based on data, and interesting real-life case studies.
The course was good, but it is difficult to learn about the different tools (R, SAS, Python, etc) without working directly with them. It is a good first approach.
This course provides a great intro to data analytics focusing on frameworks, theory, tools, and their practical applications for real-world business problems.
firstly this course would seem not effective but the moment it reaches to projects then you will feel the importance as it develops approach towards analysis
Just gives a very basic and layman level information about data analytics. Good course for people who are curious to know what data analytics is all about.
This course suit for beginner who wants to explore data analytics world on the surface. It is a good tool to introduce you to data-driven decision making
A more practical assessment should have been there. Although, 100% satisfied witht he content and the curriculum with insights from the veterans at PwC.
A great introduction course which tells you how can you use the data to drive exciting insights and to drive a faster, consistent and right decision.
This topic is really interesting and definitely will help any professional to apply a better decision-making process to daily and strategic duties
Great course but would have been better if it had more practical examples or 1 practical session so that we could relate to the teachings more
The course was really helpful and informative. i also like the feature of knowing my peers and their inputs about the subject .Thank you PWC.
An insight into pwc way of doing things. The course was worth the time, effort and investment. On top of all, it has pwc to ensure its value.
Although the course is from 2016, I would recommend it if you need to have an introduction into Data Analytics from a real-world perspective
Very useful course, giving an overview of data analytics and various tools. I enjoyed taking this course and look forward to learning more.
Course is designed to introduce the basic concepts of analytics. It is a well designed course and touches on various aspects of analytics.
Provided a good introduction to the topic and the final project was good practice of applying the course material to a real life case.
Was nice. I felt that some of the videos - especially the types of data analysis techniques could have been provided with examples.
For an introductory session, it was a smash out of the park. But I expected more practical work involving the use of data and ana
Good for building basic knowledge on data analytics techniques.... and above all a step-wise approach to problem solving.... ****
Learnt about some data analytics tools, different types of analytics, and their benefits. The simulation exercise is pretty cool!
Not bad, but vague at times. The necessary first step for the specialization, though. I wouldn't take this course by itself.
This was a good start to the programme  providing answers you may not know of how excel helps in decision making. Good stuff
Its a good basic level course, which discusses on how to think strategically and approach for the real time problem at hand.
I think if more detailed examples and elaboration can go through, the learning curve can have more significant enhancement.
Course content is well thought and put together. It is good even for those who don't have a background in data analytics.
It is a good course for beginners, but coursera database has free courses that go much deeper without payment.
Lots of good and applicable information.The last study case project had confusing instructions in my opinion.
I think this course helps you understand all the tools tha you have avaible to visualice the data you anali
It is awesome. I really learnt alot that I don't know which now am on its research. Thank you very much
Good overview of data-analysis and interesting the final project to put into practice the whole course
Valuable process insight. Not very vigorous, fits into my schedule. Looking forward to the next class.
It was very useful to understand how data is used to take big decisions, especially the PwC approach
Sometimes too long explanations and to many things, which you recap 10 times during the whole course
A good introduction to Data Analytics.Definitely recommended for beginners with no prior experience.
Very Interesting to learn about decision making by data analysis. Instructors were really engaging!
Content was sufficient however more practice challenges would have made this course more effective
Very good course to get broader in sight on importance of data and also various methods of data.
Too many concepts and high level introductions. Could be better just combine it to the course 2
Awesome course. A very good course to introduce a new learner into the 'world' of Big Data.
Good introduction to Data Analytics - Looking to forward to completing the specialization
Can be a touch axiomatic, but I'm sure it's a good basis for more important skills later.
The criteria or guidance for the final assessment wasn't clear, or could not be found.
Nice mix of technical, strategics and processes. I found the framework most helpful.
I appreciate the quality of the videos used in this course and also the continent.
Very good. It's good to know the main tools and tech approaches of data analytics.
A pdf demonstrating the use of different analysis techniques would be very useful.
A good overview, but the last week really ramped up the materials without warning.
The course not only introduces data analytics but also has in-detail description.
Its a good start for people who want to start their career with data & analytics
it's my first online course , i liked it too much . it was an amazing experience
Very good introduction into the field. Peer reviewed assignment could be better
high-level overview; little hands-on experience. good primer on key concepts.
Primera parte muy teorica, pero productiva, se adquieren muchos conocimientos
Too much theory, but the course is really inspiring and interesting. Thanks!
Great course for new comers but not very much information, just an overview
A great introduction to data science, although it lacks a lot of depth.
Peer graded review could have been done by PWC mentors or associates.
Good general overview and introductory to analytics and procedures.
Great starter course.. basic and fundamentals explained in detail.
A fundamental introduction to data system in business environment.
This course has definitely shaped my approach to dealing with Data
Tools like Tableau , Qlikview, SAS etc should have more content.
practicals should have been included for an interactive learning
A very good place and course to start with Data Science voyage.
Very well structured and presented - and great supporting notes
Good opening for understanding the purpose of data analytics.
Good intro to analytics but could've used some more material.
Great Course! Great Instructors! Highly recommended to all.
the course was very helpful to any one interested in data.
It has been give me a brightened overview of Data analysis
A good start for anyone wants to know about data analysis
A bit too much theory, but needed intro for next classes
good overview of data analytics and data presentation.
Good to know the data analysis trend and useful tools.
Very informative, but could be more practice-oriented
Very good course to understand basics of data science
Very good course which covers even from the basics ..
The course is really good and with full of insights.
A good high level insight of Data and Analytics area

Is was disheartening to put 4 weeks of effort in 1 to try and maximize the trial window period and then you don't receive the certificate because peer-to-peer review is an unstructured process and dependent on a 3rd party who has nothing to do with my investment, my time and my performance.I was trying to evaluate a few Online training options to decide which is the best to recommend to my organization but this has been an absolute deal breaker. The course has been stretched over 4 weeks when it could have been wrapped in a week. All in all a design to stretch the time and hence gain more revenues on purpose I feel - not very pro-customer.
This is a great course in data and analytics for the every day professional. It gives great insight into how data and analytics can support decision making. The mode of delivery of the course is e
What an excellent laid out course curriculum. Bite size learning, various mediums, understandable concepts applied to real life business cases made for a 100% take away and applied knowledge. We
Great high-level introduction into what big data is, how data & analytics is impacting business decision making, and how PwC uses data & analytics to improve the quality of work delivered to clients.
The Data Analytics Framework and overview of approaches, techniques and technologies are so well done that prompted me to learn more and cover gaps in knowledge. The simulation and 3 cases at the end are very important, take them seriously and do them ALL following the framework provided. I would recommend that to do those cases do not hesitate to make assumptions and do a quick wiki search on how a Financial SS, CPG or Manufacturing company work
Great course for would be management analyst or those wanting to have a deeper look into the profession. PwC offers a concise and practical methodology useful in today's fast and data rich world.
An excellent course journey for this subject - Data Driven Decison Making, very good content with relevant case assignment and they are paced comfortably to allow  me as learner to grasp the knowledge.
I can't wait to do more courses and dive into Data Analysis World more and more. This course by PwC was an excellent experience and helped me to have a high level understanding of Data and Analytics.
An excellent course to get a high level overview of various tools- how things work in a professional consultancy- concise frameworks.Good for people who are just starting up with analytics.
I was very surprised by the thouroughness of this course. The different quizzes and assignments it contains are well placed, well constructed, and they provide an adequate challenge considering the stakes. Going through this course I felt I acquired a good overall view of data science as an industry, it's impact, and it's tools. I must re-affirm the strength of the quizzes and assignments in this course before that's really what made the entire experience for me. As a true beginner in the field of data science, I came out of every assignment (especially the last few) feeling like I had given my best effort and sollicitated the key 'take-away' concepts, and that's obviously a great thing. That's the point, that's what you want.  So if you're a beginner in this domain I can say unequivocally say that I think you will also feel like you've gotten your time (and money)'s worth here, if you're ready to invest it. A course that squarely delivers on it's promise.
I learned a lot of 
things from this course. I learned how important data is, kinds of data,
 tools and programs to analyze data, data analysis framework, and many 
else. I really like this course because there are so many real life 
cases about how company use and benefit from data to improve their 
profit and effectiveness. There was also a simulation on how to be a 
consultant which gave me insights about what and how consultants works 
in helping their clients. At the end of the course, there was also a 
project. This project gave me an opportunity to test and apply all of knowledges and insights that i've got to real life 
cases.  I would really
 recommend all of you to join this course, especially if you have an 
interest in data analysis. The course can be understood easily and 
clearly. All of the lecturers and speakers are also an expert, so i got a
 lot of valuable insights
This course has given me the opportunity to be equipped with such a rare 21st Century advance tech skills, it opened a big door in my career development as it relates to the area problem-solving abilities, decision-making, big data management, and analysis, business advisory and client management. After this course, I became so interested in analysis and making effective decisions in solving both personal and business problems. It became a lead way to the new directions and charting in the line of my career life. This course has empowered with great abilities to the point that on my day to day activities I have discovered that I now offer more highly effective and impactful advisory services to both my clients and friends. Thank you Coursera, I will sure tell about this course!
This is MUST-DO course! It is very well organized, systematically introduces you to all the key concepts, and provides a hands-on experience. This course is particularly useful for those who want to make sense of all the new tools and technologies in the context of data analytics (a term that is being used in every sector on a daily basis!) I am not an IT-professional, but this course gave an excellent grounding in data analytics and provided me with a framework on the consulting-process as well. The course, with outstanding insights from PwC professionals, combines the consulting, IT, data analytics in an easy-to-understand manner. I am much more confident now to have an informed discussion about data analytics.
A good introduction to Data and Analytics from a PwC perspective and a pleasant way to introduce key personnel in the organisation.  The only addition/amendments I would recommend is additional visuals/animations to support the underlying framework, some additional case studies to support structured/semi-structred/unstructured data analytic approaches and more interactive questions during the video dialogues.  There is a significant amount of content covered and I recommend you download all the provided PDFs/jpegs for future reference.  Lastly, it would have been fun to have been provided access to ademo of a tool like Tableau to play with.
The course really helped me to get a good impression on what data analytics is all about. Not one lecturer is not pleasent to listen to, and every clearly knows what they are talking about. The final project, where grading was actually done by the fellow course participants, was a great learning experience as well if not an essential part of the course itself. A course only does you so much good, if you are never put into the psoition of applying the things you've learned. Of course, the business simulation was just as great (and fun).Thank you very much for the great work you have done in creating this course.
Learning data-analytics-related terminology and critical stages to planning, the Data Analytics Framework, Tools, and Techniques as well as Visualization Tools are all important aspects of this course that allow me to now feel comfortable with understanding and starting to execute on Data-driven decision making. The weekly lessons and activities are nicely structured, the pace is achievable without being too slow or too fast. I will be able to use what I learned immediately in the workplace, and look forward to more modules.
I would like to recommend this course to all those professionals who are seeking to learn basics of Data and its usage to make informed decisions. The course is very basic & holistic in nature as it briefly discusses the role & importance of data in form of various business metrics, that today's corporations are making full use of. Enroll yourself in this course, you'll definitely enjoy it & learn about the rapid changes today's businesses are witnessing. ~ Thanks to Coursera & PwC for this course.
Thanks! PWC to lending this excellent learning opportunities by the platform Coursera which is enriching great knowledge for the global learners. The concepts prescribed in this course were clear and precise. My knowledge from this course were there importance of Data analysis, Big data, visualization and decision making with driven data. I would like to thank for my course instructors for their valuable guidance during their lessons. Looking forward to learn some new concepts in this field.
As an overview, introducing not only an analytic framework, but walking through how to apply it and the rationale behind its use, this course has been quite helpful in organizing thoughts around problem solving. The different scenarios offered give some measure of flexibility to think about the applicability of what's learned (available tools, changing trends, guiding principles) across different industries. The lectures are clear and concise, and the progression made sense.
The course is amazing and substitutable to college courses. I put some effort on the course, and it did not eat much of my time. I think even employees who have a lot of work can take it and don't have to rush through it. If you are like me who don't know where to start and when to stop, I recommend this course to you. It clearly states how is data used to make correct decisions and gives a special process to follow in doing data analytics.
Curso bastante completo para todos aqueles que querem aprender a teoria geral de como deve funcionar a aplicação de soluções empíricas baseadas em dados.Anteriormente ao curso já vinha estudando o tema Big Data e Power BI com afinco, porém faltava uma modelagem teórica para me dar suporte nas minhas resoluções, nesse caso, o curso Data-driven decision making preencheu essa lacuna que havia no meu aprendizado, super recomendo.
Great course for anyone that's interested in data analytics. It gives a good introduction to the area with  a real-world perspective which makes it easier to grasp and understand the material. Its not a professor-type course. The project makes it even more worthwhile as it helps drive home the concepts you've learned. Overall, extremely great course!! I highly recommend it if your new to data analytics.
The course is really a life blood for any Finance Professional as no analysing the quantitative statements & facts and interpreting them and draw meaningful conclusions from them is the first and foremost task.Course is really designed in the way that what you will learn in the course so far,you will able to practise the same.Mind blowing course from Master Class Leader in Auditing & Assurance.....
This course give you the basics and taught you how to think as an analyst.  Excellent lectures.I did not appreciate having to  review my peers coursework, but in doing this, it also taught me exactly what to look for and what to do, when i have a client.  I definitely don't like talking in the forum, I dont have the time for this, but i guess in the long run, it has a value i am still to learn.
This course has been helpful to understand the fundamentals of data analysis and tools used for it. This has given me a guidance for my further studies in order to take up a course for software tools (I have been searching for a long time, which tools to learn out of thousands in the market). This course has been to the point and crisp. Thanks PwC for putting up such a well structured course.
Great course. I learned a lot of high level concepts. As suggested in the course, however, I'll have to dig a lot deeper into other individualized courses to learn specific information better. For example, to really appreciate the pivot table, I'd say that you'll have to take a business analysis course on another platform like Linked Learning or through another course here on Coursera.
It was an excellent course on data-driven decision making. There were industry experts sharing their experiences. There also was a case simulation as an assignment in the last week. The reading materials were very good visually and also content-wise. Overall it was an amazing course and I would recommend this course for people who are interested in data analysis and decision making.
This course is very good in the sense, it had the basic tutors, the people from the industry, the consultants, everyone had their input in different ways in which we can absorb. However I expected the tutors to have an extra video or two and make a data analysis of a business problem or situation. Very good course, worth the money and everyone must take it!
A great module that has enhanced my knowledge and given terminology to data types and an array of available data systems  The final assessment really helped cement the syllabus.  Week 3 was a bit overwhelming. If this is new to you, like it was to me, recommend watching, reading the accompanying notes and attachments a few times over.  Enjoyed it!
Very outstanding course to help build a strong knowledge on data mining, data management, data analysis and next generation analytic tools and more importantly helps one in differentiating all types of data in order to gain value for data gotten and deploy this data in decision making to aid growth of business or make everyday living easier.
El curso está muy bien planteado, presentaciones cortas que no te mantienen concentrado en el punto que están tratando, permitiéndo así tomar apuntes y retener la información, adicionalmente al material que exponen cuentan con ejemplos prácticos que permiten entender el tema y como se debe implementar el conociemto adquirido en el trabajo

This first part of the specialization was 
surprisingly good, especially for people like me who did not have much 
data analysis so far.  Of course, it is in parts very related to PwC, 
why not.  So you can look behind the scenes, which is very interesting. 
 From me a clear recommendation for this course and for the

I thought the course was extremely valuable and on point with the type of information I needed to know.  I do ask that you keep newbies in mind and some of the videos went a little fast and indepth for newbies to the complete data analytics process.  Some more basics would also be nice to add.
