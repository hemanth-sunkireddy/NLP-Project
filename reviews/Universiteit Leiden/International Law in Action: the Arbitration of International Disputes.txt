The course is very intense and full of information. However, the course lacks practical approach on Arbitration. It tends to feed the subscriber too much materials under a very limited time.
The course is comprehensive enough to provide an insight to international arbitration. It covers significant provisions of the governing statutes, substantiated by case laws. The faculty for the course has worked well in terms of articulation and quality of course material. A highly recommended course.
First time taking and completing an online course. Surprisingly, it was very engaging and educative. I took the course to get a better understanding on International investment arbitration and an I got that and more! Brilliant!
For those who are thinking of starting the course be aware that this is not a light course. It is heavy but it will give you a great satsifaction in the end. Takes a lot of time and effort and it's worth it.
This course includes short videos that allow me to have a general understanding of international arbitration in 4 weeks. The content is concise, well structured and easy to understand.
Although I have learnt arbitration from a very different and wide purview, I wished it was a bit more interactive. Overall I am deeply elated to have opted for this course. Thank you!
Just a few of the facts concerning the case studies need to be updated according to the latest happenings. But otherwise a well constructed and interesting course.
It was a wonderfully crafted course on International arbitration, but i had to gone through some difficulties to access forum and assignments via mobile phone.
It has been really useful as an introductory course to my next Master's Degree.

The course International Law in Action: the arbitration of international disputes is explanation very good and starting one and two lessons are not so difficult. But third questions are bit difficult. May be fourth and final exam might be like third questions have to spend more time to answer.

Best wishers to the Coursera organization team.
