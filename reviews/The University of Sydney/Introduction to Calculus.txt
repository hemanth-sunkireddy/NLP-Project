Coursera woudn't let me unenroll from the course.
The Patterns are a bit lengthy but its interesting.
Many Quiz Question are not completely given.
wish they did practice questions with an example of how they found the answer.
It is a great curse to learn the basic topics about Calculus, but it really is an introduction. The exercises aren't dificult, so I can't deep into this topics. Even though, the way it pretend to introduce the topics was great; I like it so much.
its a very good learning process for anyone who is starting or already knows calculus you will get your fundamentals revised as well as learned.
This wasn't for me.  The pace was  either too slow and way below what I needed or when areas were on topic, they still didn't make sense.
I had a hard time understanding some lectures and the exercises were a bit tough.
This is an excellent course guided by a passionate and responsive instructor.  The course incorporates the best of online learning - explanatory videos, written lecture notes with examples, and live discussion forums where real students are asking questions and receiving replies in a timely manner.  Kudos to the professor and to Coursera, hopefully you can retain this course for a very long time.  A few points of improvement if I may.  I took this course as a refresher for previously haven taken calculus about three years ago.  There is no companion textbook, which I would have found invaluable.  I also wish that there were even more examples of worked/solved problems to draw from.  I believe that an inherent problem with math instruction is that through the use of symbology (by necessity), the student is expected to learn and understand all parts of written notes.  Instead, I strongly believe that plain language explanations of in conjunction with traditional lectures notes are most valuable.  If you do not understand a single portion of a problem, you are left (as I have been) at great length to try to find a comparable problem to digest what is occurring.  Lastly, I would suggest cultivating companion videos for the lectures from open sources such as Youtube that students could view in conjunction with each module.  Despite the very best of intentions and efforts, the video lectures move very fast and at times, I think there are clearer examples available elsewhere.  Often times the Khan Academy style of working through a problem while explaining it would be a great adjunct to the content here.  Again, I thank the Professor for his kindness and passion for math.  Well done!
Having had very discouraging experiences in previous calculus classes, this was a really great experience.  Between the very straight forward video instruction, and very useful written notes, this course is very attainable with the appropriate amount of time committed.  4 stars only because the time commitments that were posted were easily half of what I actually needed to complete the course.
good course, but the topics of module 1 are too basic, but they are may be helpful for people who have bad background in math, in general course was good.But there was a few practice materials, too much theory, give some more practice materials
Whilest I greatly apreciated the consise nature of this course, sometimes I found that ample explination on particularly difficult topics was sorely lacking. Often techniques such as partial fraction decomposition would be assumed which is a problem for people entering into this course relatively blind to mathematics.If this course is re-vamped then I think more depth would be a great addition especially in areas that are particular complex and require detailed understanding.
Highly recommend this course for those looking to boost their understanding in calculus. The concepts are well-explained and the examples gradually build up in difficulty. The pacing is rather fast, so being able to catch up can be quite challenging, but manageable nevertheless. The instructor is the most engaging and enthusiastic I've had so far, and the visual representations are helpful. Overall, this is an excellent introductory course in calculus.
I enjoy this course a lot it let me review my previous knowledge on calculus as well as learning more details about integrals and limits. The course pace was perfect and the provided material cover everything supported precisely. However, I believe the length of the material for each week was too high. It could be extended for more ease. Keep up the good job and thank for your services.
Though I will acknowledge in advance that I was already familiar with pre calculus but had lost the touch due to a few years gap. Course was excellent and I guess most of the concepts are reinforced once again. The notes at the chapter end will help greatly in revision.
Interesting and clear instruction, with a fair balance of basic and challenging review quiz problems. The (relative) brevity of the course meets the objectives of an introduction, and the clarity of instruction leaves one wishing for greater breadth and depth...
Very informative course and fast replies on the thread (FAQ) page. However, I would've preferred if 'sign diagrams' were explained more thoroughly, I didn't quite understand it fully. Anyways, overall a great course to undertake.
Very participant-friendly course with excellent teaching and gradual difficulty adding, but some parts seem to be too basic, especially for Chinese students in the pre-calculus part, which undermines the efficiency of teaching.
Well presented. I liked the lectures . Notes very helpful. The only 'complaint' I have is that there were too many practice questions and when I got one wrong there was no way to tell how to get the correct answer.
The instructor and pace is perfect for a refresher course.  the material is broken into tolerable chunks of information.  You don't have to remember everything at once, just a little at a time.  I really like this.
good course for those who want to refresh their skills in calculus. Although some part are more theoretical than daily use, it has tons of question which are considered worthwhile and carefully crafted.
Sehr guter Kurs, der gerade für Einsteiger gut geeignet ist, ich machte ihn mit jetzigen 15 Jahren und er war für mich tatsächlich zu einfach, aber da habe ich wohl Introduction unterschätz.
Part of the questions are not included in the UFSP course so it is hard for student to pass the course. However, the questions are really good and can prove the real ability of the student.
A great course all around. The final week seemed much more rushed than the first four and so harder to grasp from the course material alone, but definitely worth it overall.
Taught well, however I think they should do different courses for each degree as a lot of this I do not see being applicable in my degree.
The quizzes at the end of each topic really helped me prepare for the module exams. The videos were also clear and concise.
it is very helpful for the student who are beginner in calculus...all the basics are completed the course.
excellent review of major concepts. some of it required multiple viewings, but otherwise, it was fine.
Great Course! Would have been better if it included integration by parts and L'Hospital rule.
this course is nice, because they have application problem in our daily.
Good course, well taught.  Not for math phobias.   A good challenge
It is a great and efficient introduction to the basics of calculus!
An excellent way to cover the topics for better understanding.
i enjoyed it but i understood the notes better than the videos
I learned a lot from this course. Thanks a lot, sir David.
COURSE WAS GOOD,DEEP AND TOUCHING ALL ASPECTS OF CALCULUS.
Really a good course to start learning math skills
Tough as it looks. But the time was worth it.
It's a very good course and I learnt a lot
It is very useful in quarntine  days.
Best course in the world....😉😉😉
It's many hard, You can try it.
Very intense, but satisfying.
More details are required
Nice video and Quiz
simple and elegant!
Calculus
,
I've tried a couple of calculus courses on Coursera. The others i've tried, assumed too much pre-calculus knowledge and did not provide adequate quiz's and problems. Also, they did not ease into new topics as much as i liked.This course has not only been the best i've seen on Coursera, its the best mathematics course i've done fullstop. Everything is explained right down, right down to the simplest explanations. Many things are referred again to previous videos in the course if something is covered by another video.I'd really like to shake the professors hand on this course. Magnificent work.
Excellent introduction to calculus. Clearly explained, great to have some history in there (I'd like more!).It sets a cracking pace, so do set some time aside to really get the most out of this course. Highly recommended. Gives a great basis to delve into higher mathematics beyond high school.
This professor explained all topics covered in a year long calculus class in the span of five weeks. I highly recommend taking this course either to learn calculus or for a review.
Awesome Class.  I have much respect for the instructor. I wish he was my Professor when I was a undergraduate taking Calculus. I'm going to go back and practice, practice, and practice! This class was a awesome review!  I haven't had to use any of these concepts in my job for a LONG time. I will be using calculus now in my job. Most people don't use it. I will be!  This class is probably the best class I had, so far, in Coursera Platform. I desire to take another class from this Professor. This class was well presented and well explained.  I didn't have to look at a text book for this class.The readings were highly informative.Thank you, Sir  you helped me enjoy Calculus, Finally!
This is one of the greatest course that I had the pleasure to attend. I would recommend it to anyone, whatever their field of study or level; just to open their minds about the beauty of one of mankind's greatest achievements, but also to develop a more rigorous, rational and analytical way of thinking. The latter adjectives are exactly what characterize this course. The lectures are straight to the point, the additional readings are of higher quality than anything that you'll ever expect to find in the most classic textbooks on the subject (trust my words, I have an extensive collection of these). And of course, David Easdown's way of presenting along with the graphics in the videos are as clear as crystal.   This is not a full course in calculus but an introduction. So, it has the imperfections of any introductory courses and should be taken as a complement to more advanced courses tailored for your needs. Yet, this single course has achieved the phenomenal outcome of being interesting both to students working on their A level and someone like me who's currently doing a PhD in Economics. I learnt much more here than anywhere since I first started calculus 10 years ago; I came for a refresher before attacking more advanced topics, and I'm leaving with a deep understanding of how things (which I thought irrelevant) are interdependent and make full circle. For future attendees, have an open mind: go along with the pace of the course, attempt all the exercises and don't overestimate your understanding. At the end it pays off. Thanks to David Easdown and his team for their passion and for putting the full course free of charge.  I hope that the advanced course will come soon.
During this course, I figured out that my pre-grad included neither derivatives, nor integrals (schools in province are bad). It was not a problem during my bachelor's studies in Linguistics, but became a huge issue now, once I've begun my Master's in Data Science. Finally I feel my studies getting easier, and my skin becoming cleaner and smoother every day (not really).Seriously though, this is one of the courses (especially comparing to those from Russian universities) that feel like they were actually being meant to be studied by human beings. Furthermore, it does not require a full payment (or financial aid, at that) to take tests, which are also by far more numerous and frequent than I am used to (a huge plus).To sum up, one of the best courses I've had a fortune of taking (so far). It felt really beneficial, considering I have to virtually build up my base from nothing in a very limited amount of time: exams are coming, and I still have a whole "statistics" field to cover. Moreover, it gave me a solid foundation which now  allows me to (for now) selectively add urgent things like Taylor series and get into multivariate calculus. Still, when the times are better and less chaotic, I am most definitely looking forward to the other courses from the University of Syndey.P.S. Additional kudos to Mr.Easdown, you've made the course that much better. Thank you!
Amazing Explanations..... I love how the course is sequenced and it provides not only the mechanical solutions to calculus but also the theories behind each module and topics... Great Course
its awesome course... Mentor is skilled and explains everything clearly.But if anybody has little bit pre-calculus knowledge it will be more helpful.
This is a great course and anyone interested in getting into a more detailed study of Calculus should start here.  The only suggestion I have is to make the answers to the weekly exams available because it helps to know which ones were incorrect.
An Absolutely incredible course. Well structured, and David Easdown is the best math instructor I've ever had. Thank you University of Sydney, and Coursera. And Please make a more advance calculus course as a continuation from this one.
Well structured course, fast paced and very challenging. First three weeks were a much needed precalculus review that gave a strong foundation. Last two weeks on derivatives and integrals were gruelling but comprehensive. For the complete beginner this course makes the subject possible as long as you take each bit, one tiny piece at a time and understand it before moving on. Nearly gave up but glad I didn't. Just wish there was a next step. So many of the other maths moocs expect you to be a genius with too many leaps in explanations without explaining how you get there. This one is an exception in that it makes no dangerous assumptions about your knowledge. Calculus is a road block that keeps many out of science. This course goes a long way to removing that block. Please do more courses to build on this.
An Amazing approach. It's posible enjoy all thing in all modules because the course's prof. presents as much default Calculus topics as wonderful applications about the covered subjects.
its a very interesting course and i really want to learn this so thanks coursera community and specially the speaker for providing such a wonderful and handy knowledge and notes.
Builds the idea of calculus from the ground up. Explaining everything steps by step and giving great examples. Overall great course.
While the material is at an introductory level, it is comprehensive.  The exercises are well-structured and the lectures clear.
Easily the best Math course I have ever taken.  Offers the flexibility to stop and rewind the narrative, but unlike just reading a text, the instructor conveys his own infectious interest and excitement.  The instructor anticipates aspects that may be more challenging, and offers background material to help the learners understand.  I was supposed to learn all this thirty years ago, and it never made sense until now.  Cannot recommend highly enough.
This course was perfect for me as I hadn't taken calculus since 1970 as an undergrad. I needed the algebra and trigonometry tune-up that is provided at the beginning, and thereafter the material flowed beautifully. Thanks to Professor Easdown for his relaxed yet rigorous style. He incorporates just what I wanted, an appreciation of mathematics as an art. Bravo Professor! Michael Leahy, Chicago, Illinois USA
I want to thank Prof. Easdown (and SU) for an excellent course.  The material was organized and timed at exactly the pace that was perfect for me.  In addition, Prof. Easdown was consistently accessible and prompt responding to my questions and feedback.  I don't see a next course, but I hope there will be one and look forward to progressing with the next course in the series.Thank You Prof. Easdown!
Professor Easdown is an amazing teacher and made something that is often perceived as difficult to be fun. The course covers a great deal of information in a short time, but Prof. Easdown is thorough and breaks topics down into understandable sections. The addition of colorful examples and historical facts adds a relaxed tone to the course, which is exceptionally helpful.
An excellent course that not only teaches the fundamental of calculus, but also goes beyond a typical math course and explains why and how the equations arise, instead of merely asking you to memorize them. The instructor is phenomenal and helps to show the elegance of calculus and how all these applications naturally flow from a few basic principles.
This course was great and very well explained; it has given me a solid understanding of calculus as well as the tools needed to differentiate, find integrals, etc. I highly recommend this course.
Hands down the best class I've taken on Coursera thus far (my 5th).  Incredible instructor, superb video, amazing notes. Could not recommend it any higher. Will seek out again. Well done!
it was so informative and every things was planned intelligently all trough the course . I enjoyed and learned a lot of studying this course . Thank you for all your efforts.
I Loved how you could have the option to look over the notes instead of the videos to complete the course at a faster rate.
The teacher is great and if you are beginner this course is really for you
Great course .thanks for the efforts .
Excellent and interesting course
18 years ago, I failed grade 9 math with a 23%.  Today, I passed Introduction to Calculus on
Coursera, which is offered through the University of Sydney and taught by Professor
David Easdown. I wish I could say that I actually enjoyed the course,
but I feel like that would be doing a disservice to the version of myself that
has been pulling his hair out for the past 5 weeks.  Indeed, if I’ve learned anything during this
process, I’ve learned that Calculus is hard. 
Very hard.I will say, though, that this is in no way meant as a slight
against Professor Easdown and the style of the course.  Quite the contrary; Professor Easdown is an incredibly
engaging teacher and manages to make this very difficult subject digestible.  And while I wouldn’t say at this point that I
can ‘do calculus’, I would say that the course was very, very rewarding and that
it certainly provided a cohesive overview of the pertinent topics in the field,
as well equipping the learner with a thorough understanding of the symbols,
language, and relevance.  The notes that
accompanied the lectures were very valuable and helped fill in the gaps, and
the structure of the course was very smooth as you transitioned from one topic
to the next. I took this course because I have been rolling through
some courses in Artificial Intelligence and simply found that I was out of my
depth and simply coding along without any idea of what I was actually
doing.  And while memorizing algorithms
and formulas has its benefits, I decided that I want to fully understand this
field – and I don’t think that one can do this properly without a fundamental understanding
of Calculus.  This course provides just
that. The practice quizzes were more than a little challenging
(with the last couple of questions usually very, very challenging).  I found that I often had to supplement the
course with alternative resources, such as Youtube, Khan Academy, Symbolab, and
so on.  I had to re-watch lectures and thoroughly
dissect the reading notes.  As I
mentioned, it was a very difficult process that had me pulling my hair out and
I’m a bit ashamed to say that I nearly threw my laptop on several occasions.  However, as it is with learning any new
skill, you just have to keep pushing through knowing that it will be worth it
in the end.  Then you get to a module exam, and at this point you
realize how you’ve learned so very much in such a small amount of time.  It’s honestly incredible.  And by the time you get to the very end of
the course, which I did today, you realize that you somehow have all the
prerequisite knowledge to step by step make sense of equations that might as
well have been written in a different language just a month ago.  I don’t feel like I can describe that
particular feeling.  In all, this course was one of the more rewarding
things that I’ve done in recent memory, and I’m so very grateful to Professor
Easdown for putting it out there and making such a thorough overview of the topic
so accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it.  I coupled this with 1blue3brown’s series The Essence of Calculus on Youtube, and
between these two I feel like for the first time in my life I have a true
appreciation for the art of mathematics and I’m very eager and inspired to
carry on with my studies in this field.  Thank you so very much.  Jack
This course is great, I very much recommend anyone taking it! I took this course after almost six years since my last math course at the end of high school. At that time, I  was very happy that I would not have to deal with mathematics ever again. But professor Easdown opened a new world for me. He made me appreciate that math is a fresh and alive discipline that can be understood if you find the right tools and work with persistence. His explanations are extremely clear,  making students understand and appreciate mathematical concepts, and not only to mechanically apply formulas. He provides great lecture notes and readings which cover the topics explained in the videos, sometimes with deeper explanations and proofs. In the notes, there are also examples of exercises, which are very helpful for successfully completing the quizzes accompanying each module.  The discussion forum is a great learning place. There are many interesting questions posed by peers and you can post your questions there too. The professor is very active and very kindly replies to any query in a very timely manner. This course is amazing. I very much recommend it to everyone, especially if you think math is a dry and useless subject that can't be understood, this course will make you change your mind!
Took this course as a refresher since
it has been a few years since I bothered with calculus and pretty much forgot
most things. This course really doesn’t assume too much pre-calculus knowledge
and instead contains a pre-calculus refresher that lays the groundwork for the
calculus in later modules. Although a few times I needed to pause
the video lectures to give myself enough time to understand the logic in later
modules, overall the video lectures were presented in a straight-forward and
engaging manner. David Easdown communicated concepts concisely and his way of
speaking and enthusiasm for math helped keep me engaged with the video lectures.
The readings are also well put together and allow you to go over video material
(plus more for certain lessons) at your own pace. Practice problems were mostly
easily although a few could be a bit more challenging (but not too much). As
much as I would have liked a few more challenging problems, it is an
introductory course, so the current question difficulty makes sense to me. Overall, If anyone is looking for a
well-put together introduction to calculus course (even as a refresher), I
would highly recommend this course.
This is the best course on this platform, and perhaps the entire internet.It's very hard to be enthusiastic and passionate over a video lecture, but instructor Professor Easdown excels in this area and learners will fine the lectures very engaging. Everything is explained from the ground up, and it is clear that the course aims to provide a thorough and fundamental understanding of the topic, rather than simply learning by rote or procedure. If something isn't explained fully, we are told why (usually due to complexity) and are told where to look if we wish to find out more. The assessments are perfectly structured and strike the balance between challenging and accessible. If there is any trouble, Professor Easdown is very active in the Discussion Forums and provides excellent guides to any difficult problems. This course is substantial, but not overwhelming. I found myself doing around an hour a day on average. You really do feel like you're learning something to a significant degree, but you are not forced to make sacrifices to find time to learn.Overall, an excellent course that avoids all the usual MOOC pitfalls.
Excellent course! I learned so much in such a short amount of time. It's an excellent introduction to calculus and a good way to increase your mathematical skills. The lectures are great and the readings allow you to get all the information at your own pace and are a good way to get familiar with proper mathematical language and notation without being hard to read (if you have paid attention!). The quizzes and exercises are challenging enough to make you think and feel rewarded for being able to solve them, but not enough to make you want to quit them (in fact, I had a lot of fun doing them!). My advice to other people that want to take the course is not to rush it and to do all readings and exercises (try to get a perfect score in all the exercises and to understand all the questions before attempting each week's quiz). I am grateful to the University of Sidney and to professor David Easdown for making a calculus course of such high quality accessible to everyone. I feel more confident in my math skills and ready to keep learning more advanced stuff
This is a very well-crafted course that builds in a very systematic way. The algebra also builds in complexity. The quiz's are challenging and prepare you well for the module assessments. The notes are well written and will serve as good references for me in the future. The delivery of the content is done with enthusiasm, clear mastery of the subject and clear diagrams and explanations of the key concepts. Thank you very much for a beautifully crafted course, I wish I had understood Calculus this well when I was in high school. Highly recommend the course. However, for me, I found I needed to spend much longer that what is estimated in order to fully grasp some of the more difficult quiz questions. The notes and the forums do fill in the gaps when you get stuck. I feel an enormous sense of achievement and confidence in the subject. Thanks Prof!
This course was a ton of work and took me a lot longer than 5 weeks to complete, but I absolutely loved it!  The material is presented by a fantastic, well-spoken professor with a contagious enthusiasm for the subject.  The well-built user interface includes video instruction with accompanying notes and practice quizzes.  The user forum is also super helpful where the professor offered help to students' questions along the way.  I found the default deadlines helpful to maintain momentum, but appreciated being able to reset them in order to accomodate demands on my personal time.  Altogether, this course is world class and well worth the effort.  Thank you, Coursera and Professor Easdown!
This course was exceptional as a refresher for someone (me) who hasn't engaged in calculus in over 13 years.  Professor Easdown communicated concepts in a straight-forward, easy to understand manner.  It shocked me how he introduced so much material, so quickly, so concisely, and so thoroughly.  The readings followed and expanded on the videos exceptionally well and will serve me well as reference sheets for the future.This summer, I attempted 3 other processes to learn Calculus, each leaving me more lost and frustrated than the prior method.  I only wish I had found this course earlier!  If any seek a good introduction/refresher to Calculus, I recommend this before anything else!
I wanted to review pre-calculus and that's exactly what i found in this course.David Easdown is a great lecturer and conveys the best attitude towards mathematics possible. It was so much fun to listen to him explain everything. Also he's very active in the forums for this course, answering pretty much any question arising which is great if one has trouble with the exercises for which he has also provided general hints in the forums.This course was perfect for regaining all the knowledge i learned in school 15 years back. And this over a the course of 10 weeks spending just over 100 hours. (I was going a bit slower on my own terms)
I used this course as a refresher (I took calculus ~6 years ago in high school) and it was very effective as such. I prefer written notes to video lectures, so I cannot speak to the quality of the videos, but I found the notes to be concise, effective, and easy to follow. They provided several interesting and informative proofs and derivations that I don't recall learning about originally. I would highly recommend this course to anyone mathematically minded, whether or not they have taken a calculus course before. Many compliments to Prof. Easdown, who was very helpful in the forums.
I enrolled in this course a long time ago and at first, I did not go through because I saw a lot of exercises. Little did I know that those exercises were very carefully created to cater to the best learning experience for the student. Prof. Easdown is the best Calculus teacher ever! If anything kept me going throughout this journey, it was his enthusiasm when teaching. Thank you soo much sir! "Please read the notes, and when you are ready, please attempt the exercises", the enthusiasm is priceless. Again, thank you, sir, and thank you Coursera!
The lessons were delivered clearly and explained the content thoroughly, delivering both mathematical methodology and history, allowing students to grow and develop an appreciation of the mathematical concepts. The tutor was superb with his teaching methods, and often replies to questions on the forums when a question seems to difficult to overcome.Would definitely recommend to future students who are new to the concepts behind calculus, as the high quality of the content provided gives clear insights into what-seems-to-be difficult concepts.
I can not rate this course highly enough. The instructor has this contagious enthusiasm and genuine love for his subject. The accompanying lecture notes are really helpful and the quizzes push you hard. I would love to see a course on more advanced calculus from him. Although being an introductory course, it does not shy away from slightly more complex topics and leaves the student with a broad understanding of calculus. These were four very enjoyable weeks and I am now eager to dig deeper into advanced mathematics. Thank you very much!
This was a fantastic introductory course to the basic concepts of calculus.  Dr. Easdown is an amazing teacher able to distill the most complex of topics into simple and easy-to-understand language.  His passion for mathematics is palpable and infectious.  I would highly recommend taking this specific course to those looking to get an introduction into calculus or even to those looking for a refresher in topics before more advanced study.  It was well worth the effort over the five weeks.  Thank you so much, Dr. Easdown!!
I would like to thank Prof. David Easdown for the very good presentation and lectures that he had given. I took this class to refresh me with fundamental concepts of Calculus as I have taken the Calculus courses more than 40 years ago. The presentation is very clear and the reading materials enhance the concepts that are discussed in the presentations and provide clear examples that I used as guides in reviewing and taking the chapter quizzes. I look forward taking other courses from Prof. David Easdown in the future.
Really thankful for this wonderful course. Prior to this course I never had the confidence over the concepts of calculus. During my school days all I was taught was "How to solve the differential equations, etc." with not even slightest of emphasis put on teaching us what we were actually doing and why we were doing it. This course gave me the understanding that I liked. Guess I'll be one of those now spreading "Math is fun". Thank you Coursera and especially Professor Easdown.
This is the best calculus introduction course i've ever seen. The way David Easdown teach was very very good and easy to understand. He mixes history with concept of math so you don't just learn to use calculus techniques, but also understand the history and the concept behind it. Very very recommended for those who seeks an introduction to calculus. Though, a bit understanding of algebra will be helpful. Kudos to University of Sydney and David for making this course free!
Great execution ! I deeply think that the math presented here are affordable for everyone and therefore is a great way to get initiated to the calculus. The teacher is great and the videos, the sheets and quizzes provided are really good to improve the understanding of each themes covered.I'm starting new studies in mechanical engineering and it was really refreshing and educating to follow this course. Thanks a lot to provide such great content ! Definitely recommended.
The course is excellent on content and its Delivery. Mr. David's, the instructor, enthusiasm and energy is infectious (poor analogy given the time but still an absolute FACT). Covered pretty much the basics and introduction to calculus in a fun way. Content Delivery is awesome and extensive with range of examples. The course is designed like a continuous story, coherent with previous week's modules and his presentation is extraordinary. Please Keep up the good work.
It was my gretest pleasure to listen to the lectures of  Mr. Easdown. I liked Math at school, our teacher was very knowledgable and passionate about the subject. I've met just a couple of such great teachers like him. Mr. Easdown now is one of them. Even though I started this course just to refresh logarithms, I could not resist to finish it and always looked forward to the next lecture. Moreover, I would love to attend another course made by Mr. Easdown!
David Easdown is one of the best educators I have ever had the privilege to study with.  His knowledge of the material is clear, but what is more remarkable is his ability to explain the advanced concepts in a clear and concise manner.  Even more impressive and notable is his enthusiam for the subject - he has clear joy in studying the field, and he shares this almost mystical enthusiasm and wonder with his students.  Thank you for the experience.
One of the best course I have ever learnt from Coursera. David is an excellent instructor and explains the concepts thoroughly. The best part is that he himself answers all your doubts directly. If you want to have your basics strong in Calculus this course is for you. A very good course and I am pretty much sure that you won't be disappointed taking this course. Thanks a lot to Prof David and Coursera team. Thanks & Regards,Mohamed
Excellently presented course with a great instructor. David Easdown's enthusiasm for the subject helped keep me motiviated. It does require a lot of work per week to keep up with the suggested schedule of the course, but just keep in mind they are not hard deadlines and your progress is not lost if you do not meet them. If you want a great introduction into one of the most interesting and useful areas in maths, give it a go!
Fantastic! I hadn't taken calculus (or any other math) for over 20 years. But I will be taking Calc II for a data science degree. So I registered in this course as a refresher. It covered all the material my professor recommended that I review in preparation for Calc II. The lectures were interesting and well-timed. The exercises were great practice. And I'm saving the notes as a reference.
Marvelous and fascinating course. David is teaching this course with such passion and enthusiasm. Every small detail is explained with care and provided with examples which help students fully understand and experience why the theory behind works. The fully detailed reading notes and quizzes accompanied to each lesson are the icing on the cake. Highly recommended.
One of the Best Math Courses Ever!I Really do hope that  the university of Sydney make sequels for it  and Mr. David Easdown thank you very much for the effort and the entertaining way you offered this course in!really appreciate your effort  and loved your enthusiasm for math
This is a great course to take for people who are not at all involved in Calculus maths. I was new at it and I truly believe I have learned a lot. Excellent instructor and very comprehensive materials.
Best math instructor ever! Very engaged in the topics covered, so much so that he inspires it within his students, even those of us who do not share his love for the subject. Highly recommended!
Very good course. The teacher is amazing!
Great calculus refresher course!
This course is extraordinarily tough. I thought the illustrations were very helpful with connecting concepts and there were times I got excited seeing where things were going mathematically. The professor is very helpful and is very excited about the subject, which I greatly appreciate. My only thing is that this course is horribly misnamed, but maybe the US and AUS have different standards for what is considered to be an introduction to calculus. You pretty much have 2 weeks pre-calc and then cover all of calc I over 3 weeks, plus some extra things to where I found it a bit overwhelming at times. If you're looking to level up your skills, he gives you some very helpful tools with which to do so.
Thank you! This course was exceptionally well-organized and engaging. Dr. David Easdown is a passionate lecturer, and I very much appreciate how attentive and active he is on the forums supporting students and answering questions. As a person with a weak mathematical background who has been intimidated by calculus courses, I found the material provided the right level of challenge (the the video lectures/notes could move quickly through more advanced applications of the techniques we were studying, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the practice problems--it was a good balance). I have built some confidence in being able to tackle more advanced courses in the future. Thanks again!
El profesor es muy entretenido, sobrio, explica bien y se detiene en los conceptos. Se nota que "vibra" con lo que enseña. Los apuntes excelentes, sin grasa, claros y precisos. Los ejercicios destinados a la comprensión de los conceptos, no muy difíciles lo que ayuda  a entender la materia y no complicarse con artilugios algebraicos. Las referencias históricas y relaciones con matemáticos que construyeron el cálculo, notables. En Chile, estamos en plena pandemia (al igual que el resto del mundo), pero nos ha pegado muy duro. Tomé este curso para olvidarme un poco de la contingencia. hacía muchos años que no veía estos temas. Valió la pena. Nada  que decir. Excelente.
Excellent course materials and explanations for the most part.  Exercises were very useful as were the notes provided with the different sections.  There were only a couple of things where the instructor presented an idea which needed to be used to solve a type of function without adequately giving the origin of the idea and how it worked.  I would absolutely take another course from this instructor and this has made me interested in taking another math course to progress beyond the material presented here.
İnstructor David Easdown has been created a great course. The course is nourished with both so educative videos and notes. I also really loved instructor's sketches :) which are complete masterpieces. I had taken this course with some previous calculus experience and now with completion of this course I can easily say knowledges here developed my comprehension. I wish to thank David and other people who helped to create this course. I look forward to see new courses coming soon :D
I thoroughly enjoyed the course.   I have not taken university Calculus in over 30 years, and I thought of doing this for fun, and I must admit, I enjoyed the material.  My first experience at University was very tough, but I found the way it was presented very organized. The videos and notes are well done.  Professor Easdown does an excellent job of presenting the material, and you can tell his passion for the course.  Great Job.
It's a beautiful certificate course which enhance the level of highly polished mathematical instruments of calculus and it's various applications it's very useful for technical and non technical students. Specially thanks to prof.David sir who analyses each and every topic and contents in detailed and the notes was also well enough to carry on the practice quizes. Thanks to Coursera also for adding a beautiful course in it.
The Calculus is a fundamental tool for engineers and is incredible the ways this teacher approaches this introductory course, it is highly recommended for begginers, as for engineers who wants to review the fundamental concepts of this important topic. It is remarkable the way he teaches the basic concepts of algebra to reach the calculus, is outstanding!! Thanks to Coursera and to Professor David for this opportunity.
Its really wonderful courses and  It is very useful to my career.This Course will boost my
job. It will help perform better in carrying out my professonal and give me an
edge over my competitors. I  have to learn different types of ways in this course .Definitely  i have  to join  and learn different types of courses in coursera.I really thank to give an wonderful opportunity to join this course.Thank you very much.
I took this course to challenge my memory on many aspects of algebra / calculus. I am a retired system admin ( Linux systems ) and have always loved mathematics. Was definitely impressed and pleased with the wonderfully thorough and patient teaching skills of Professor Easdown. The videos and notes along with the challenging quizzes were absolutely fantastic! Thank You all at Coursera and especially Prof. Easdown.
The professor Dr. David Easdown is the very best Calculus instructor I have ever had! He is an excellent teacher who not only explains the concepts but also discusses the origin and use of the mathematics being developed. He does this is such an engaging style that motivates to not be afraid and jump in and learn more. I would love to take more courses with this professor. I highly recommend!
thank you for the option to do the course with all assignments unlocked.it gave me the opportunity to study at easy and Sir did a wonderful job.At first he sounded like an alien but then i paid attention and it turns out.it was 1+1,simple to the one who gives an ear.i failed so many times till i got it right.Calculus its still hard but i enjoyed this course.And i am looking forward to more.
It is wonderful visual and oral explanation about calculus. Even though I am Mathematics graduate, I understand the physical and geometrical explanation through this course. I recommend those who are like to begin their calculus class through this course. I heartily thank coursera for providing me a opportunity to learn.  This course prove that courser is the master of online courses.
This course was amazing! Had no prior knowledge on Calculus, however the professor really managed to make Calculus look like a fun and a stimulating course. He explained everything with so much detail yet clear, and his passion for Mathematics is really visible through the way he explains things in each video. Love this course! highly recommended. Thank you Professor Easdown!
David Easdown has a case of Mathematics Enthusiasm more infectious than any epidemic. While the course is obviously a top-notch intro to calculus, it is also worth a look for anyone who's had a rocky relationship with maths. You will come out of this course with a solid appreciation for mathematics as a whole and a stable foundation for learning more calculus in the future.
This course on calculus has completely changed my perspective about maths, I never get the concepts of function, domain, range,  limits, the derivative, the integrals, but after completing this course now I am fully confident regardings the fundamental concepts of calculus.

Sir, you teach me very complex looking concepts in very simple language.
 Thank you so much, sir.
This has been a really great course and I thank Professor Easdown very much for making this happen. This has been my first encounter learning calculus, and I joined this course for me to have an insight into calculus when I start Year 12 this year. But I have learnt much more broad ranges of concepts than I had expected in a very easy to understand and adaptable manner.
David has been incredibly helpful over the duration of this course. The process of videos and detailed notes before consolidating learning have been super useful! I highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to step into University math or who has an interest in calculus. Although it does get hard, I'm sure you will have just as much or more fun than I did.
Excellent course! Clear explanations, comprehensive (includes a module on pre-calculus so it is a great way to refresh memory for those who have had some prior education as well as beginners!), engaging quizzes and a very helpful discussion forum. Also well-paced - 5 weeks is not too long nor to short! Definitely recommend as an introductory course on calculus.
Very nicely organized introduction to Calculus. I felt comfortable taking this course after having been away from mathematics courses for a few years. The instructor is excellent uses some great applied examples of different concepts. I could have gone without a few of the proofs in the second week on derivatives and the week on integrals. Really good overall
This is without a doubt the best online course about calculus. If you are looking to build some strong foundations or get a refresher, don't think about it, you are not going to find a better course. Shoutout to Professor Easdown and the team that built this course, you've really done a superb job! This course is thorough, high-quality, and best of all, FUN!
Great course! Professor Easdown is so engaging - his enthusiasm for calculus and the material kept me going when it got tough. I had an introduction to calculus when taking a machine learning course, and decided that I wanted to understand the fundamentals better. This was the perfect course to choose to get down the basics! Thank you Professor Easdown : )
An excellent course, which provides great insights. Although I think myself as good at mathematics, it proves to me I am not.  Most of the quizzes are designed very effectively to test the understanding. I really sense the challenge while answering graded quizzes. The material instructor provides is  really helpful for understanding and revising concepts
Professor Easdown's obvious enthusiasm is matched only by his attention to detail. I'm thoroughly impressed at how well he breaks down each and every concept into clear, concise explanations that successively build on each other. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from calculus, but I now feel that I have a solid understanding of the subject matter.
Un excelente curso donde no solo aprenderás Cálculo, sino desarrollaras otras habilidades matemáticas a medida que se avanza en el curso y por lo menos desde mi opinión aprender a ver el cálculo desde otra perspectiva y sus aplicaciones de la mente de unas de las instituciones más importantes del mundo. La verdad me voy muy satisfecho de este Curso.
I really loved this course, with my bare Calculus knowledge from highschool. Thanks to the venerable lecturer, I have remembered all my knowledge from the scratch, and I think that I have done this by apprehending all the topics. Thanks Sydney University and Mr. Easdown, I am pleased for attending this priceless course! Greetings from Turkey.
This was an excellent introduction to calculus.  It was well presented, well set out and logically explained.  I really enjoyed following each step, I found the quizzes and assessments a challenge, but with careful attention to the videos and notes not impossible.  Thank you Professor Easdown, you have inspired me to dig deeper into calculus.
Thank you for this introductory course on calculus! I was not in touch with mathematics for a while now. It really helped me to recapture my memories of calculus from the school.  I am thinking of getting back to studies again with a master's course, hopefully on computational science. I believe this course would prove to be really helpful.
Must say , one of best courses I have gone so far.  Mr. David ( instructor) has such a passion while explaning concepts that you simply fall in love with his teaching methods. Thanks a lot Sir !!! His eyes , facial expression and breathing makes you feel  that its not maths you are listening but a wonderful story like Lord of the rings !!!
I was looking for a refresher course on Calculus and found this one. This course is just what I was looking for and it not only gave me a refresher but also gave me good ideas to solve tricky problems. So so thankful to David for this course. If you're looking to start calculus or need a refresher, this is a superb one to start with.
The course was more than I expected. All the instructions, videos and lectures were carefully designed, using the different representations of each mathematical concept, allowing me to interpret them geometrically. Also, each quiz evaluated the contents of each task in a very similar way to the way they were taught. Thanks for all!
Well, as a Chinese student who suffered so many hell-like math tests, I would say this course is extremely easy for me... But it really arouses my interest in math again! Can you believe once I was concerned that me myself was not good at science? Anyway, I am sure calculus can be helpful in my future study. Thanks professor!
The explanations of the instructor are very comprehensive it has filled in all the gaps the I lacked regarding the complicated concepts I still have not understood back in high school. I have gained a good foundation in calculus through this course. Thank you so much, the University of Sydney, and to professor David Easdown.
The course was quite thorough and rigorous for an introduction to calculus.  The instructor very effectively presented the material in a manner that was very easy to follow.  The supplemental notes provided helpful insight into the lessons including providing very helpful derivations and example problems.  Very good course.
I think there's a good balance in this training. Nice short video's with clear text and enough exercises. I found the material challenging t times at other times it was quite simple. The teacher is friendly and explains things in a peasant way. I think he is also very well to follow for non native English speakers. Thanks!
Brilliant introduction to calculus. I used this to help me revise A-level mathematics (core 3 and 4), and it did a very good job of that and some more. Lots of practice questions after each video and very helpful notes. The video lectures are taught in a compelling manner and take one through the steps of using calculus.
I learned a lot from this course. I never thought introductory calculus was easy until it was explained thoroughly by the course facilitators. There are some concepts where I need to rewind again and again to fully grasp the concepts. The practice quizzes and graded quizzes really helped me in understanding the topics.
The course i.e Introduction to Calculus is amazing. I would prefer all the students to take this course. the course which is taught by David Easdown is an excellent teacher. He gives a complete explanation of the given topic. Moreover, if you face any problem in the given question he helps you in the discussion forums
Anyone a bit rusted or wishes to have head start in learning calculus should seriously give this a shot. One of the best courses out there for those who aspire math. I hope Professor David Easdown continues to create more such courses related to advanced mathematical concepts. in the coming future. A 10/10 overall.
Professor Easdown is one of the most enthusiastic teachers I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. His love for mathematics is very contagious and will make this 5-6 weeks seem much shorter and much more pleasant. I highly recommend the course for anyone interested in calculus and mathematics in general.
Loved the course. Professor Easdown treats calculus as it ought to be treated  - it's magic! I took the class to brush up on my calculus after many years removed and it didn't disappoint. Thanks so much professor Easdown for putting together a well-structured and cogent class. I highly recommend you take it.
Most helpfull and very recommend for every Mathematics student who want to learn how to draw graph from curve equation and all type of graph....also helpfull for learn and create intrest in calculus..that topic will be good...and the professor is amazing in teaching..they make you solve problems easily...
Challenging towards the end, but the first couple of weeks really prepare you for it. Although the only flaw is that, it's so much content!! I do not regret it though, taking this course. I'm a high school student and I found this very informative and preparatory before starting Cal in grade 12.
Thanks Professor Easdown! You are the best teacher I've ever met. The course is always easy to comprehend and succinct and I can feel your joy for studying mathematics. It made me feel joy too, in studying mathematics. I really look forward to your new course in advanced calculus. Thanks a lot.
An excellent instructor and a very good course. It was tough, but I made it. I found the strategy of providing accompanying notes to the videos particularly effective, and something I suggest to all instructors on Coursera, especially those engaged in mathematics-related courses. Thank you.
Very, very, well explained, for everyone (even for me, without a strong math background). A lot of exercises that helps to fix the knowledges and a detailed notes for every argument. A lot of help directly from the instructor in the discussion forum. One of the best courses I ever attended.
This is really a super great course for both beginners or advanced learners. The instructor help clarity many important Calculus concepts from basic to advance level. I'll definitely review it again when I got time, really thankful for making Calculus easy to understand. Thank you so much!
I am a high school math teacher taking this course as review.    It was a great way to get back into Calculus.  The videos and notes help immensely.   The instructor does a great job of balancing practical examples while making sure to challenge those that would like to be challenged.
It is a long time since I have done such a course.  I found that it was really valuable because it did not spoon feed me and made me go away to revise things I had long since forgotten. Really worthwhile not just for the content but the way in which it made me go about learning.
The teacher of this course will motivate you to learn calculus. His teaching style is quite fantastic. He makes you feel like you are discovering new things. He is very polite and courteous and makes you feel comfortable learning math. Thank you Mr. Easdown for you great work!
The course arrangement is superb as it allows us to comprehend calculus progressively. As such , you won't feel overwhelmed and be able to appreciate calculus more. Highly recommend this course and it would be better if the audio for certain lessons can be slightly louder.
This course is very well designed and very intriguing. High recommend! I really like Mr.Easdown's lecturing sstyle, he somehow make math courses much more interesting than the ones I took before! Many thanks to Mr.Easdown! I do appreciate your help through out the course!
Me gusto mucho las explicaciones breves y sencillas, los diversos ejemplos y situaciones hipotéticas que facilitaba la comprensión, también agradezco que en los foros se proporcionara ayuda para los ejercicios prácticos. No se  me hizo pesado y lo disfruté bastante.
Exactly what I needed! Clear, concise explanations covering a wide array of topics. Moreover, the professor's visible mathematical passion and enthusiasm made the course all the more interesting. It is definitely the most structured and intuitive dive into Calculus!
This is a great course. The explanations are clear in each video and the notes give the level of detail needed to consolidate the material. Occasionally it goes a little fast, but the Professor is very available and helpful in the discussions for each practice quiz.
The course was amazing!! I enjoyed  watching the videos, reading the notes and attempting the exercises. Mr. David Easdown is a wonderful teacher and I enjoyed each lecture. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I hope to pursue further courses in mathematics.
Este curso me ayudo muchísimo a entender muchas cosas referente al calculo. Quiero agradecer a todas las Universidades y profesores que ponen sus conocimiento en pro de la comunidad y un  agradecimiento especial al profe DAVID EASDOWN de la Universidad de  SYDNEY .
Great teaching and notes, it helped me explore many basics in calculus that I couldn't understand in last 30 years of my life. Real meaning of what is calculus,why it is important. Thanking the tutor on this occasion, who transformed me to a better maths aspirant.
This course helped me familiarise myself with the wonderful field of Calculus and also introduced me to mathematical analysis and mathematical modelling. it also enhanced my problem-solving skills in a way that will benefit me in other complex mathematical topics.
A great course for knowing some basics of calculus. I only have high school knowledge of trignometry and functions but I still manage to understand the topics taught here. Its very good for the teacher to explain the rationale and good use of graphs to illustrate.
Professor David Easdown's calculus course is rather enlightening and insightful. More importantly, he showed the calculus in a fun and enjoyable way. Plus, his enthusiasm is contagious and makes me absorbed to his calculus world! Millions of thanks to David:-)
Very good course. Well designed and the assignments and tests are well suited for the content of the course. But then of course we need more than those to really master this subject. I particularly like the zest of the professor he presented in the lectures.
This a really wonderful course, which reveals the in-depth of the basic calculus. Hows, things are developed and are utilized in our daily life are the crux of the whole course. Besides, the convincing way of a professor is very pleasing and informative.
This is a totally legit course.....Although I,m an engineering student already familiar with calculus, this changed the way way i look at this subject.....Excellent teacher, intuitive approach to teaching math without compromising on rigor. Hats off sir!
one of the finest and outstanding professor ever seen..profund one. Truly a gem to university of sydney and this global field of education. thanks a lot from the bottom of my heart. may almighty always keep u ever happy. eager to learn  more from u sir.
This is fantastic course and I wanna thank professor a lot . In future I would recommend this course all who really  have interest on Calculus. Thank you coursera to give me such a good oportunity  to have this course and make my pandemic life worthy.
Thank you for the detailed information. This professor has a great way of explaining the material and even gives some hints and extra detail on how to do problems in a different way! I love the layout and the reading material. Thank you for the class!
The course was really a refresher but I find it very challenging for me since I am not teaching higher Mathematics. Thank you so much. I would like to go back and revise all the videos and note latter. Appreciate so much the explanations and notes.
The only problem that I saw was that the print on the computer was very light and sometimes it was hard to see if it was a minus or plus sign!Otherwise I really enjoyed taking this fast paced course.  Thank you David, you were an awesome teacher!!
Beautifully designed slides and useful sheets help me understand and consolidate every new terms and formula. Teacher is good at inspiring and leading me. I believe that this course will be proven helpful when I take the interviews. Thanks a lot~
Great course, amazing Professor who looks very passionate about what he does making the course very enjoyable to take. Great notes created by the professor and great support throughout the course.  Completion of the course set me up for success.
Fantastic course. I last studied calculus during my university economics classes about 12 years ago and had forgotten almost everything. David's lectures kept me engaged throughout, despite a fairly hectic work and home life. Highly recommended.
The instructor explains very well mathematical steps that are usually hard to follow as someone that have very little background in Math. I totally recommend this course to anyone, and I'll be considering taking more courses from this instructor
Quite good for people with no previous calculus experience. Focuses more on differentiation rather than integration. If you have previously done calculus and are looking to brush up (as was the case for me), this course may be too rudimentary.
Introduction to calculus course is a five-week course well organized by instructors. Very interesting course with video sessions and quiz problems covered the complexity of all levels. Thank you "The University of Sydney".Thank you "Coursera"
The course is nicely paced with a great blend of challenge and guidance. Prof. Easdown shows an infectious enthusiasm for the subject that excludes no one. Honestly felt encouraged to do everything asked of me. Just the refresher I needed.
Simply - lean way to become higher than average in calculus. Love the course with its subject and material structure. Lecturer explains all the stuff lovely and with passion. Music introduction deserves separate appreciation. Thanks a lot!
I enjoyed the course. Professor Easdown is easy to listen to clearly explains the concepts.  I took calculus nearly 50 years ago but never used it and found that in this 5 week course, I got a good handle back on the basics of calculus.
This has been a fantastic course. Fast paced and covers a major portion of the landscape. The passion of Mr. Easdown towards Maths and Calculus is amazing to watch and hear. Would love to go through a similar course in advanced calculus
This is an excellent course, with a lot of examples, exercises, and a great presentation from professor Easdown. Every topic is explained with a detailed explanation and the charisma of the professor. I really recommend this course.
Muy bueno este curso donde aprenderás todo lo relacionado con la introducción al cálculo lo recomiendo mucho para aquellos estudiantes que se inician en carreras de Ciencias e Ingeniería y quieren aprender cálculo de variable real
Great course, helped me build a comprehensive understanding of calculus. Highly recommended if you want to start learning Calculus. The practice quizzes after every topic helped build the concept which was taught in the videos.
Great Job, Introduction to Calculus if very important course, Functions and the applications with functions, derivation  and integration with this course clear and easy.I hope to complete to reach to advanced calculus.
Awesome instructor and explaining very well! I learned a lot. I wish Prof. David Easdown was teaching other more advanced calculus courses. I would take all the courses he teaches. Thank you very much, Prof. Easdown!
A very well designed course, topics were thoroughly covered and progressed in manageable (if sometimes tough) chunks. David's pro-activity on the forums was also extremely helpful. A model for how to do a MOOC well.
Prof David is a really good teacher. He provided vivid and concise course content, which make me insist to finish the course for basic Calculus.   Really want to say thank you to him, and wish to see you again!!! ;D
Very good explanation by professor  David Easdown . I would recommend in India whoever passed class 12th science stream to go ahead with this course this gives us intuitive idea about calculus atleast differential.
Very interesting and nice course for anyone who wants to learn Calculus. The course has been very thoughtfully designed. The first week is a bit easier, however it keeps on getting head-scratching towards the end.
The course is well designed and the contents are  beautifully explained by sir David Easdown. It war fun learning the course and I find the course useful for the person who needs to develop  basics for calculus.
I found this Professor's gets the attention of audience. Also I learnt many new interesting materials in math. If the students in his class are really interested in learning math, I can say they are very lucky.
Great course! Enables learners to learn at their own pace with plenty of support and additional information. Encourages critical thinking and mathematical development. Easy to follow instructions and videos !
VVVVV great course and VVVV great instructor. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about calculus and understand the principles and the underlying ideas of it. Thanks Coursera. Thanks David.
What an amazing course. I wish professor Easdown would have another more advanced calculus course. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and it really cleared up so many concepts that I rely on in Computer Science.
An excellent course in Calculus. I am glad to have taken this course. Professor David Easdown has made excellent and inspiring content to keep up the interest and motivation and in 5 weeks, I learnt a lot.
If you think are bad on basic math (High school) or you need some practice for the university, it´s perfect. Maybe it goes very fast but if you go at your time, you will remember/learn a lot of knowledge.
muy buen curso, a pesar de que el ingles no es mi lengua nativa, logré entender todo con claridad, hasta completar todo el curso, invito a todas las personas cuya lengua materna no sea ingles a intentarlo
For the first time, I was able to practice and learn Calculus in a clear way. This course gave me the opportunity to understand the applications of derivatives and integrals in a way I never did before.
I pursued this course out of pure academic interest. Though I took time to finish it, I loved it. All credit goes to Mr. David Easdown and Coursera for compiling and teaching the subject so beautifully.
Best course so far i had in calculus. Awesome.. Anyone interested in calculus or want to learn first time this is the best course to go for. Hoping to have advance courses in calculus by the prof soon.
I have completed quite a few courses on Coursera. This is by far the best instructor. I really hope David is going to do teach another Coursera course soon - I will sign up regardless of the content!
Exceptional course. Fantastic explaining by Professor Easdown, I wish more teachers were as clear as he is, and as kind and thoughtful towards their students. Many, many thanks in case you see this.
This is a great course. As the contents are arranged very well and the instructor teaches it very well. Also, the plus point is that after watching every video notes are provided and a exercise.
The course is amazing, the teacher is incredible that makes the course be cooler and easier to do it. I enjoyed a lot the experience and certainly will help me to develop my professional career.
Thank you so much for this course! I really like it. It smoothly take you into the world of calculus without any barrier. All you need for prerequisite is some practice in algebra manipulation.
Um curso lindo para aqueles que estão na universidade ou estudando a disciplina de introdução ao cálculo. Vale a pena, conceitos bem definidos e é o melhor curso de cálculo que já tive acesso.
An amazing course with detailed explanation of fundamental techniques in Calculus. I would highly recommend other students trying this course before taking any advanced studies in Calculus.
I took this course to brush up as I took calculus 3 many years ago. I am very pleased with the instruction and the course overall although it has been a humbling experience! ;) Thank you!
A good recap of important mathematical concepts and and different perspectives, providing interesting elucidation, to what is already known. Thank you for this course, it was superbe.
This is a fantastic course which teaches me a lot about a new topic-Calculus from beginning (Precalculus) to advanced calculus. Connections between the daily life are well developed.
I have taken this course to revise my knowledge and to learn in-depth about calculus. This course helped me a lot. The lecture was great and the instructor is very friendly. Thanks!
very informative and very conceptual course. Thanku very much to coursera and University of Sydney for providing this opportunity.Thanku very much or gratitude to course instructor.
Very interesting and innovative ideas of calculus have been taught. Really very good platform to learn calculus. All the topics are explained in very easy way. Thanks team Coursera.
Probably, one of the best calculus course that sparked my interest in mathematics. Professor Easdown did a great job of explaining it, and, the problems were never easy! Thank you!
This course teaches students from very fundamental skills to harder concepts in calculus. The videos are clear, and the teacher is patient. I feel sooo great after completing them!
The course is well-organized and easy-to-follow.  When I completed the course, I not only felt as though I had learned but also believed that it was time well spent.  Thanks.
David Easdown is a great teacher! Fantastic presentation and excellent communication made this once  daunting subject approachable! Hope to see more like this in the future.
Excellent course, with so much easy explained information. This will help me to remember all the Calculus basis. Congratulations to Sidney University and to the professor.
This was the awesome course not only for the beginners but also for the ones who have higher degrees but scares to read calculus. Interesting course with great lectures.
Clases en vídeo muy claras con notas de cada clase que resumen lo enseñado en las mismas. Lo recomiendo para aquellos que quieran recordar conceptos básicos del cálculo.
David Easdown is great. He clearly loves what he does and it comes through in his teaching. A worthwhile endeavor for those interested in the fundamentals of calculus.
Thanks a lot Professor David Easdown for the wonderful lectures. The videos were engaging and full of knowledge and the exams were challenging. Keep it up!!! Salute!!!

Well its amazing ,i have completed course and now my basic in calculus is much more clear ,i must recommend this course to all who have interest in mathematics.
David is one of the best teacher that I ever had in my entire life even though it's an online class but he still manage to teach us clearly and understandable.
I love this course! It covers all possible topics for the introduction of calculus. Quizzes are challenging but finishing the is still worth it... Thank you!!!
Really helpful course, the most interesting time I have ever had with maths. The instructor is passionate and  so helpful. I thouroughly recommend this course.
Simply loved it, i was able to understand calculus in terms of graphical thinking and easy mathematical principles, sincere thanks to Professor David Easdown.
From this course ,i was able to develop logical thinking about curves sketching and area under curves.Thank you so much sir..for your wonderful video lecture.
I liked the way the sir had explained the course with wide ranges of example.It was awesome experience to learn the wide topic with in short period of time .
Greatest course Ever! For an economics major this was jump into more fundamentals than in any economics class. Professor Easdown's enthusiasm is contagious!
Simply the best math course I've ever taken. The right amount of thoroughness and challenge. I feel like I have a much better understanding of calculus now.
Overall it is a good course, it has refreshed my knowledge about calculus. Expecting to get advanced level courses on calculus, in near future. Thank you.
I knew almost nothing about Calculus and after finishing this course I completely understand it, this course was a great help and I totally recommend it.
I’ve been teaching science for 31 years in a highschool. This course was really a good way to refresh my mind. Moreover, the professor was outstanding.
The teacher is really good and he proves every formula he uses. Also, additional material is provided so you can understand everything you are doing.
It was a great course...I had great fun learning...the professor's explanation was really gud ...nd it helped alot...On the whole it was wonderful...
Excellent module design. For me, 4th module was tough compared to all other module but for any problem refer notes. They are very helpful. Thank you.
Great Course. The material is super useful from a data science perspective. The explanation is thorough and made a lot of sense to me. I recommend it
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. David re-kindled in me an excitement for maths. I cannot recommend this course highly enough. Thank you very much.
This is a great course which takes one carefully and step by step through basic calculus. The instructor is awesome and always helpful in the forum!
Excellent way of explanation, as I am a professor so it is fine for me. For students, it will be good if you could provide some more study material.
Very well paced and provides plenty of support material, I really recommend this course if you're interested in mathematics and wants to get started
Hey this is Rajdeep, I really loved it. This course was very good and it's very easy to grasp. I would really suggest everyone to just try it out.
I have completed this course sponsored by my university Riphah International university. So why I have asked to pay 49 dollar to get certificate?
This was an excellent course, you never get tired, it is precise and the work material is always a great help. Thank you so much for everything.
That was an amazing learning experience, this course made calculus a lot easier and more fun!Thanks to the amazing instructor sir David Easdown!
This Course has successfully made me fall in love with calculus. I hope professor Easdown does more courses like this-Arnav Jayswal10th Grader
An excellent instructor, very well-explained examples and operations, and helpful exercises to help throughout the course.Highly recommended!
Thanks.For me, I learnt Calculus ten years ago.  This is a very good refreshment course.  Best wish it will have advanced calculus in future.
Taking the course was the best decision. I was able to brush up on my calculus while learning new concepts in the process. Great videos too!
