I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says "non-credit course". This is despite the fact that the course equates "35 PDU's" and "counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm"; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?
Unforyunately all the information is rather basic, most of the knowledge provided is intuitively understandable. Didn't learn anything new. Probably the problem is that it really is super basic and may be useful for somebody who is doing 1-2 year of Bachelor's.
WOW, I like this course and the way videos, lectures and power-points are organized. And am looking forward to enroll next course of this specialization. THAKS
Instructor is not clear and too fast!
Too easy to pass through...
I think there is a major thing that wasn't planned good. There has never been an available option of downloading the lessons of the Introduction to Project Management in a PowePoint/PDF document.Printing these lessons page by page takes a lot of time and moreover is a terrible waste of paper and trees!!! Even if I would like to save it in a electronic version I would have to save it page by page, for which I don't have time! This is ridiculous, sorrySincerely, Anna Wolska, MSc, PhD
The course is quite shallow and I feel like this course is just intended to sell the reference book ...
Very little interactive content what is presented is kind of boiler plate..
did not pertain to the work i do currently
The context is not strong
too basic !!
It has not enough content, you can just read the chapters 5 to 7 of PMBOK, and its the textbook that you'll use in this course.
The course itself is good. However the lesson does not always make it clear what the topic for the week is. There is a lot of external reading that is recommend, which means buying additional books.  I also miss real life learning. Having a case study to apply the learning to would be very helpful. Instead the course asks you to "think of a project you have done" and apply what you learned to that. The flash lessons are very helpful.
It's quite good. Ups - very detailed and teaches a lot of valuable things regarding the projects.Downs - everything goes by the PMBOK and the other book. More real life examples from the lecturer would be beneficial. Lectures are good, but in the end, not that detailed as most of the info is from the presentation.
Too much unclear, indirect language. Definitions are not concise. The entire course needs to be re-written in the active-tense and proof-read by a party not versed in project management in order to ensure that buzzwords, jargon and institutional slang are edited out.
Content is good. But more is there in Presentation that we have to self read. It would be better if somebody explains in video. Because reading we can do our-self and lots of content are available freely. But we spend money so that somebody teaches us those things.
Most of the material was straight out of the PMBOK. It would have been cheaper to just purchase the PMBOK. Additionally, a lot of the important material was contained in a Flash website, and is not available as a PDF for future reference and accessibility.
Too much theory, it is not good to learn so many terms without context and examples.. But still, it shows me how complex project management can be. It is actually more important to apply the knowledge in a practical way.
the course is great but we need to know the the answers for the wrong questions if we passed the test because I keep trying to solve the whole quiz one more time and keep getting wrong question after submitting !
It uses PMBOK 2013 as the basics for the course (please, update the contents !). It has more power point presentations than videos from experts in the area. The lecturer is good at sharing knowledge.
The quality of the instructor videos is poor and they are difficult to comprehend at times because the instructor is reading directly from a script rather than actually teaching the material.
Some of the videos are helpful but a lot of the information is just copied from the PMBOK and could use more explanation.
This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.
I think the Course touches the basis of Budgeting and scheduling but feels light on the information.
More videos/ audio sessions instead of slides would have been better for understanding the concepts.
I don't really like the format. I want lectures from the instructor, not animation and slides.
Much lighter than the introduction, leaves you wanting more... Maybe that's the plan?
It is better to merge the content of all 3 courses in one... very less content
The readings were marked for 10 mins but it exceeded more than that
The contents are very good to refresh my knowledge on the topics.
Wish they gave more clear information on the calcuations.
I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.
More videos would have helped me to understand better.
great as a beginners course
Good Work
It is a course that integrates basic concepts in project management
would have preferred more example for better understanding
Wonderful course. It was very well written with all major topics covered. Bonus video and Panelists Interview were also very helpful. However I would like to mention a small mistake in the week 4th's lesson, slide no. 3.23 has a network diagram, which has last activity written A instead of I. It changes the calculation for complete forward and backward pass. Also, Margaret explained the network forward and backward pass with the value of first day as 1. However in the lesson it was taken as 0, which again changes the formulas she described in the video. It's not difficult to understand the difference but it somehow breaks the harmony.
This course was slightly more difficult than the previous course in the specialization, which is expected, yet very informative and builds upon previous knowledge. The introduction of duration calculation was very interesting and actually fun. The budget estimation felt a bit rushed. But overall the course was very helpful and great introduction to the project management world since I can recognize and understand many of it's vocabulary and terminologies.
As I mentioned earlier, there is a lack of translation of this course. All text materials, of which there are many, do not have the ability to translate and even the ability to copy for translators. The course is good, but the material is very difficult to perceive, because it is presented in large parts, it would be more convenient and clearer to break all large videos and text materials into separate parts on separate subtopics.
This course if very helpful in learning the proper way of budgeting and scheduling projects. The discussions are precise and gives you a better understanding about the topic without dullness. The case studies and exercises really help to test the knowledge you gain from the lectures and readings. Would recommend this course especially to engineering students and professionals who would like to improve on the topic areas.
I really enjoyed this course and took my time to do the practical exercises which helped solidify the learning.  In my opinion, the lessons are long and wordy and I would recommend breaking them into smaller units to make them easier to learn.  Also, I think some important concepts were touched lightly and could have been done better by including scenarios or even some practical exercises.
After completing this course you'll have a good idea on how professional PMs schedule and budget complex projects. It will also teach you some valuable techniques that can be applied to projects you may be handling in your own work. I was unfortunately not impressed by the fact that the final exam was quite simple, simply borrowing questions already asked during the lesson quizzes.
Introduces helpful methods when it comes to estimating the duration of the project. The case study videos are fun to watch. The slides/lesson from the PMI are a little bit dry and formal, especially those depicting the different processes with their inputs and outputs. As in the preceeding course, I wish everything was a little bit more 'hands on'.
This course is very important as no project can exist without spending  and each project has programs which move on with time. Therefore this course is important for the projects to be successful.it can be rated to 95%.Great thanks to the instructor and Coursera directors for giving me this opportunity of pursuing a certificate in this course.
It was a great course! Two areas that in my opinion need consideration, are, one, I believe videos take less time than reading materials and people learn better from videos.  Two, I did not understand why there was a lesson on project quality management while the course was about budgeting and scheduling.
Helpful course to get a good understanding of budgeting and scheduling projects. Obviously, nothing trumps experience, however this course supported me in how to think about the budgeting and scheduling aspect of a project, and what are the key terms and ideas to keep in mind during that process.
Succinctly put course material. Lays down the key aspects and hammers them home. I wish the video lectures were more in sync with the reading material, though, especially the part where estimation of activity is explained. The plus one and minus one had me in knots; unnecessarily complicated.
This course is a good starting point for people who have never handled bigger project from start to finish. But, for managers and others who had the experience of handling complex projects might find it less interesting because the course didn't cover many real world examples in detail
As I become more familiar with the subject matter the more I'm enjoying the modules. I would like to suggest some more interactive content to help with different learning styles. Otherwise very informative and I like the presenter and the panellist discussion at the end is good.
While I found this to be a helpful course, some of the most helpful 'walk throughs' were imbedded in bonus videos. Would like to have been able to easily access slides in a pdf format since there was so much info on each. There were less lectures and more slides than expected.
A little more complex, good for someone who has already seen a company go through the budgeting and scheduling processwould like to see more information on the videos since I feel like there were points missing that you had to read through and guess instead what was important.
At first I thought the subject would be technical and boring, but gladly the wealth of clear knowledge, 
 the valuable insights, and the sharing of good practices and life experiences made it both 
enjoyable and highly informative.
Need to make it more technical with resources & Problems pertaining to Critical Path. This is a very basic primer - detailed problem sets with a higher complexity of scheduling add significantly to learning !
Course is quite detailed and insightful. Personally, i would have appreciated a detailed peer-peer reviewed assignment at the end of the course. Other than that, it was an amazing learning experience.
I really enjoyed taking this course to learn and understand budgeting and scheduling projects.  The course materials and case studies allowed me the opportunity to apply my learning to real life.
A good overview for budgeting and scheduling projects. The course focuses on the basics, but also does a good job of introducing more advanced methods for both financial and schedule management.
Tough course but a great amount of information. I already knew some general project management things and implemented them. Knowing more and of the PMBOK will definitely help in the future.
nicely planned, good use of real-life experiences. The lectures should be broader and made of several short duration videos. Too much reading content.Overall very helpful.
This course got me started in a nice way to understand the Budjeting and scheduling. Although it does not cover all matters, but now I am much interested to learn more.
It's better than the first course of this specialization. but as i mentioned in the survey, i think lesson 2 that includes 3 huge parts of PMBOK is not a great thing.
I liked the course, I find it really usefull. Although, I would like to have more reading material, as PDFs or articles of the subjects (material that I could save).
Very helpful module for beginners. Would be good to add a more practical and updated example for example using Microsoft Project Management. Thanks fro the learning!
This course is great knowledge for Budgeting and Scheduling Projects, and what I like most about its contents is networking diagram which is fantastic explanation.
I wish I could see actual budgeting process.  Will be very useful to see how to get the gross, net gross, and average revenue of the projects in different areas...
Margaret Pelloni is an outstanding professor and has a very good material. It would be better to have some kind of project to build and be evaluated by peers.
It was a bit difficult for me. Theory was a breeze but the mathematical aspect was a little hard, but I'll grasp it with a little more practice I guess. :)
I would recommend to add video sample of creating for example construction project from the scratch, to show connections, critical paths, predecessors etc.
I like this coruse and I hope to allow downloading the lessons as "PDF" for the students to get more benefits and to save these lessons as References
The subject gets appropriately harder in this part of the specialization, but the problems with certain parts seeming to have been rushed persists.
Thank you everyone on this course. The course is good. It should very good with more examples of phased oriented WBS and deliverable oriented WBS.
I quite like the course, except that I find its a shame that we can not download the flash presentations to keep them for future references.
Full of interesting consideraciones you are not aware when you are the one who participantes in executing a project but not playing for it.
This course wasinteresting amd quiet technical and the instructor was explicit is breaking it down to anyone's understanding. good course
The course has been of great help to me and I love how broken down the concepts in smaller parts that are easy to understand and learn.
I think this was really concise and packed with great information, but there was less of a focus on budgeting than I would have liked.
its a nice way to learn, for Indian students.i have difficulty during the interview session some of the words meaning i didn't got .
Well organized and straightforward. Would like to see more interactive activities for planning the schedules and network diagrams.
since i started the course i have seen and learned so many techniques and standards that i can implement at my place of work
This course is beneficial to my personal life and business career. Course lessons are explained well and easily understood.
Nice quick overview of Budgeting and Scheduling. Handy to read the two optional readings as well to gain more perspective.
Very good information and good to see current highly praised project managers being interviewed and giving their opinions.
Its a nice course, pefect for those who want to improve their scheduling. Here budgeting is not the strong part.
the final quiz should be more difficult, or questions reworded to help internalize information in a deeper way.
It's a good course, give me skills like resources identification, Project scheduling, Project cost estimating.
The Course was organised in a simplified manner that helped me to understand how to schedule a piece of work
this second phase (course) reallyt helps my learning about how to become a project manager in simple way!
A great course. Has increased my knowledge tremendously.I will willingly recommend it to others.
The course is very interesting and I have got a deep understanding of Budgeting and Scheduling
Good course for basic and mid level project management professional having practical exposure.
This is really helpful and reinforces what I have studied previously in my advance Diploma.
Excellent content, well explained. The flash lessons could be slightly better structured.
I  have got my PMP credential but I still need more learning to help me to do my work.
Good course with practical situations.  Just need a scenario for practicing the skills
Would like some reading materials and simulation for critical path to be practiced.
Amazing to understand the basics. Looking forward to the next part of the series.
Muy buen curso, hace falta que se compartan más plantillas y documentos de apoyo
Its a good course to start with for learning basics of scheduling and budgeting
It is excellent course... Its content/material and explanation are excellent.
Too easy. Making it harder and more realistic would have been better for me.
A unique explanation for a lot of points time and budget for the projects .
it's too overview with not enough details, as for me. But is usefull at all
it's ok. Thank you for your useful information that i have learnt recently
Great course! Would've been better if the lessons contained more examples.
Would have given it a 5 star if final exam questions were non repetitive
I learned quite enough to carry those aspects of Project at basic level.
Glad to learn and develop skills and knowledge from this course.
Well the course must be more enriched with real life assessments
some concepts are vague and needs more explanations and samples
good structure, but minor deviations between lecture and lesson
Overall good course. But more practical examples are required.
Good substantive knowledge, the delivery was somewhat lacking.
very helpful and practical course，lecturer is very interesting
course is good , it will be good if you add more case studies
Très bonne maîtrise et animation du cours par l'instructrice.
It's brief but it could help you for reviewing some concepts.
It is very good, but a little short on detailed information.
excellent course,good teaching materials and great lectures
Very good introduction for persons interested in learning m
Good overview of how to schedule and estimate the project
I feel I have a good overview/introduction to the topic.
I learned a lot! This was great, highly recommend it.
Learned the things which are use full for my career.
I would like to see more study cases in this course.
No regrets on taking this course, been worth while!
It's a little difficult to grasp certain concepts.

missy
I enjoyed this course, the mix of the video presentations and the powerpoints are well done. The instructor does an excellent job. the 'bonus videos' and 'panelist interviews' are very good as well.
Great material and well organized for the busy professional. I enjoy the interviews too. Thanks!
Excellect knowledge-based study
Doing this course 'Budgeting and Scheduling projects' gives learners, a practical approach to Project management based on PMBOK methodology. Prof Margaret Meloni is a great teacher. Students will enjoy her crisp and clear communication of ideas. Slides are  well designed. Video quality and sound quality is also great. You will encounter lots of good quality reading materials. Quizzes will help you to test your knowledge as you progress. Overall, an excellent course fit for project managers and project team members who work for construction projects. Also good for the aspiring project managers. Thanks to Prof Margaret and UC Irvine for the great course.
An excellent formation of the core topics indeed! I found it very informative & concise in terms of mastering the basics of Budgeting, Cost Estimations & scheduling; a panel interview led me to capture the hands-on approach from industry experts. Thank you Team!
Great course going into important details on cost and budgeting.  I really like the video portion which gives real-world examples that help reinforce and bring the concepts to an everyday audience.
It was very helpful to see estimation budgeting and scheduling processes.
Tim required is mre
As in the other UCI Extension courses, this one have a good structure and a complete set of information that makes its simple to understand the basics of Schedule and Estimating in project management.
time, money, and labor that are need to organize such a project are the main materials. we can learn how to use these materials in specific and efficient way.
The topics were broken down and simplified for better understanding. The case study scenarios were also apt, though 1 more for each model will be useful
Attention: Margaret MaloneyHelloMy name is Sajid Mirza and I am taking the course on project
management. I am really enjoying the course and it has been really a good
experience. During the course I have noticed a typo error which if my
understanding is correct, may please be modified. Details are as below: Introduction to Project Management, Lesson3 (Budget and
scheduling week4, lesson 4.2), during the lesson at CPM:  Duration and forward pass, section 3.23 the
figure shows “EF” of activity “b” as 4 same as “LF’ of activity “a”, However,
in the bonus video and in the PMBOK at page 176-177, it requires to add 1 in
the EF of the successive activity. May please correct if my understanding is
right.  Thanks and RegardsSajid Mirza
Great class with a great teacher. She explains the material using layman terms in a concise manner. What I also like about her is that she feels passionately about the importance of the work of a Project Manager and it shines through is very contagious. I highly recommend this class along with the previous one in this series. I'll post another review regarding the next two classes as I haven't taken them yet, but I am very optimistic that they are as high of a quality as the first two.
Learned a lot about Project Management, this course is aligned to all professional whether on different function of an organization. Margareth Meloni and the Panels are great - learned a lot from them. I also love the Reading Lesson on Project Time Management book, and I enjoyed each Case Study. I recommend this course to any individual as at some point or another, whether small or big, you may handle and lead a Project professionally or may even be personal ones. Thumbs up!
It was very good course. I learned lot of important information very briefly through this course. Video content and as well as documents are very well prepared. They are very attractive and make me interested to read. Further discussion which were in every week after the quiz and final interview gave me good knowledge about the practical scenarios from the expertise in the field.
In my opinion this is a very recommendable course. It's worth all the time one spend with it. The explanations are very good an also understandable for non-native english speakers.One gets ideas how to avoid pitfalls and, why some steps that are requested by the bosses at the very first moment ("how much, how long") must not be answered before other steps (mainly WBS) is done.
The course was very comprehensive and applicable. It was very easy to understand and the speaker is very engaging regardless of the recorded video format. The knowledge shared was especially valuable regarding the minimal amount of information discussing how to run an actual project. Now I have some idea how to effectively run a project based on the PMBOK.
An excellent course with professional tutors. The course gives an insight into the Budgeting and Scheduling projects. It covers most of the basic topics in an excellent, elaborate and understandable manner. The panelist interviews covered are a gold mine as you listen to the experienced people from the project management field sharing their views.
Participating in this course has been an illuminating experience. I have gained solid theoretical background and practical application scenarios on project cost management and project schedule management. The role of strategic quality management was also emphasized and driven home. I look forward to the third course in this series. Tank you UCI.
This course is definitely worth taking as it is very detailed and all the reading materials are high-yield and highly supplemented with explanations in the videos. It did not just focus on how to budget financially but also budgeting time and resources in order to not compromise the quality of the project and the product.
Excellent course.  The videos by Professor Meloni are greatly supported by follow on presentations and quizes.  Great information backed up by the interviews of professionals from the field ad to the learning enviroment.  I have already become an advocate for Coursera and reccomended to many of my coleagues.
All information is presented in an accessible form. You will have to read a little and understand the charts in this course, but there are enough detailed instructions and explanations on the examples at the end of the week. So you can figure it out. Perhaps this will have to review several times videos.
First of all, many thanks to creator/instructor Mrs. Margaret Meloni who teached and shared a lot knowledge from fundamentals to advances of Resource, Budget and Schedule planning as well as management skill sets. There was a lot attractive case studies, well-organized lessons helped me to learn fast.
The course highlights the key aspects of cost, time, schedule management. The course gives a good clarity of PMBOK 6th edition lessons. Miss. Margaret has done an amazing job of explaining the key terms very easily. The bonus lectures are worth watching and the case studies too.
The way you have paved the knowledge so systematically, it is laudable. An average student such as me- could easily grasp the spirit of How the Budgeting and Scheduling is done. Surely the panel discussion gave lots of insights in addition to the teaching by Ms. Meloni.
The "Budgeting and Scheduling Projects" course was very useful, with lots of hands-on examples and valuable real life experience based expert tips. I also enjoyed the level of interactivity and small tasks within the course slides and the case study videos.
enjoyed the lectures, presented in relaxed atmosphere, with easy step-by-step to understand, practice, and built project activities scheduling and assessment. I recommend even to non-Program managers, good to understand how pieces of the puzzle fit in.
Thanks to this cours, you will act more confidently in your business, you will use professionnal tools and knowledge. So you will bring security. This tool will change your life because you will do it your way but in a manner understood and shared.
The panelists interviews at the last week of the course is simply amazing.I love how this course not only teaches the theory, but also the practical part of the job and the daily problems that (beginner) project managers might encounter.
thank you so much for this course, i am sure i understand about budgeting and scheduling projects. its also has such a point that you can highlight for your knowledge. dont forget to watch the video from the lecture, it was so helpful
little confusing on week 4, not about the math, the math is super simple but whether I should use ES equal 0 or 1. Margaret says 1 but slides says 2. Apart from that, great course. Much more interesting than the first one.
It was very good , informative and covers all the essential information on estimating project budget, considering cost factors and techniques to  manage the schedule well which is eventually tied up tot he cost
This course has actually reinforced all the concepts I had studied previously in such a way that I won't forget again. I would highly recommend this course to all those who have interest in project management.
Excellent knowledge! I've always got in trouble with scheduling and budgeting. What a night it has always been in my project. Now with this Technics, I will be merciless with no guessing at all! Thank you!
Very interesting and insightful course, with practical information on projects scheduling. The instructor is increadibly engaging and cheerful making even the most hard things easy to understand.
Excellent practical advice given in the tutorials and videos that will help you avoid some of the common pitfalls of project management and make you look a true project management professional.
This course has really helped me in understanding my work better from a project's perspective. It has also highlighted the pitfalls in project's planning and executions we face everyday.
AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO LEARNING WITH COURSERA. THIS IS ONE OF BEST ONLINE STUDY SITE IN WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THIS TYPE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARNING COURSES. KEEP IT UP....
Budgeting and Scheduling helps you to attain the budget needed for the project itself. It also helps to monitor you cost versus your timelines in order to minimize the overtime and over
A best-elaborated course and quality group discussion of the panelist in last, A lot of learning inbuilt with this course. Thank you for the quality of information and certificate
I like the Coursera way of teaching.  Course content was right for me and the assessments were of a standard which meant I got the recognition I required to achieve my objectives.
It was a great experience. one thing i has to suggest is to check the answers of the quiz. a question about float. i thing i had marked the correct option.but it shows wrong
Loved the course! Simply excellent professor! I've taken other courses as well but found this the most interesting. Recommend it to anyone interested in Project Management.
For me, a perfect mix of delivery, exercises and quizzes to give me valuable learning experience. I enjoy the combination video / reading format of the material delivery.
Very helpful big picture overview of critical competencies for budgeting and scheduling projects. Immediate application for numerous projects I'm managing or co-managing.
The course was really helpful in understanding the importance of scheduling and estimating costs. The course also gave some good mathematical approaches to map the plan.
Great tools to use in real life! Good depth over the different strategies for budgeting and scheduling projects.  This course reminded me of why I am taking this course!
Great course as the others in the specialization. As mentioned before, the emphasis on having the PMBOK Guide available for the optional readings should be emphasized.
It is a well thought and well understood that really threw more light into all the areas seems so difficult in my earlier  earned master degree in Project management.
Madam was excellent and very much involved. Excellent course design and teaching methodology.I felt that I am studying in the classroom.Thanks to Madam and cousera.
This course is sound.  I found it easy to navigate, full of valuable information and the tests were unambiguous and relevant to the material presented.  Well done.
Great course for the people seeking out to learn about Project Management. Margaret Meloni has done an amazing job. The course content depth was perfect as well.
Amazing course. My fault it took me too long to complete but I totally recommend it to people interested i that subject. The content was so clear and targeted.
This course is very informative.  It provided an overview of the project management structure. I also learned about budgeting processes and useful techniques.
That was definitely grate but that was also a lot more information. I had to sit down and really concentrate to make sure that the information was setting in.
This is an amazing course! Big thanks to Melanie for her great efforts! I really learned a lot from this course, and find it very practical and interesting!
Great course! gives you a great perspective of how to start scheduling and estimate your budget for new projects!I love this course and how it is presented.
Accessibility, quality and clarity of instruction, good graphics, useful discussion from a variety of experts. All reasons for my high rating of this course
Cost Estimation Techniques are explained nicely. The scheduling concepts are simplified as never before. The faculty and the expert teams are mind-blowing.
The topics were broken down and simplified for better understanding. The case study scenarios were also apt, though 1 more for each model will be useful
I liked this course because it contained enough information. information had a complex perception in some places, but i understood everything. thank you
Great course to understand budgeting and scheduling of a project. I especially love the tips on how best to manage stakeholders throughout this process.
This course definitely helps a candidate to gain knowledge and skills bout budget , project cost estimation, and budget management. I love this course.
I really enjoyed the quality of courses offered by Coursera. Simple structure and effective methodology is the key to the success of suggested courses.
It was a pleasure for me to take part in this course. The lessons are quite well structured and the video lectures are great. Thank you for everything!
Good practical lecture and coursework on variables/requirements on accurate budgeting and scheduling.  Offers both good theory and practical examples.
Its a great initiative by coursera in this pandemic condition that  this helps who are looking for imprpvising there technical knowledge and skills.
Great course, good overview. I can take the info that I'm still a bit fuzzy on and dive in deeper. The instructors pace is good, clear and relevant.
Course is really great. It has strong theoretical knowledge, but focused on practical experience. Cases told by teacher and panelists are awesome.
Excellent program design, and it was interesting to understand how to construct the network diagram. Thanks very much Margaret. Thanks Coursera!!!
This course was really packed full of useful practical information and I felt like I got a lot out of it despite years of experience in the field!
Now I can predict and estimate the budgeting for my project and also scheduling the project with some consideration in order to get better result
Course contents were good and easy to understand. A slightly longer video lectures with a bit more elaborate teachings would make it even better.
Great Project Managment principles course.  Some good sample opportunities to flex your knowledge and lots of reinforcement of PMBoK terminology.
The honorable instructor briefly showed in Bonus videos the Forward and backward process which is really excellent. This course really helped me.
Excellent course for beginners, especially if you want to learn more about project management and creating project network plans and budgeting.
The course is really enjoyable to take. I can follow along with the instructor and understand what it is going to take to be a Project Manager.
It is the best course which explains all the relevant details to budgeting and scheduling. . The instructor are explains very well every topic.
the syllabus is clear and sharp. I got what I need most. the videos also made me easy to understand, with added graphic and artificial visual.
Excellent overview of the subject matter and how PMI approaches it.  I believe it helped me tremendously in getting prepared for the PMP exam.
The class was something bigger than expected and I’ve gained so much knowledge about Project Management. Thank you Coursera for this course.
I like the course a lot. I would highly recommend to do the optional readings because show what you learn in the course in much more detail.
It is quite informative course and we learn fundamentals of budgeting and scheduling projects. Thanks to instructor and Coursera as well!!!
Great course for those who just started to study project management and for those who want to improve their performance. Thank you Margret!
This was quite very tough, challenging and mind-engaging. Nonetheless, it was very interesting for me.Thanks to Lecturer Margaret Maloney.
Great videos and information. The terminology wasn't too complicated and everything was easy to understand. The pace of learning is good.
Great course that introduced me to the best practices a Project Management can use as they approach Budgeting and Scheduling of projects.
Sticks to PBBOK material and get's your required education hours for PMP exam without costing thousands.  Materials are presently well.
Excellent journey and fantastic learning during the course completely binding with the lectures and readings full of  knowledge gain.
I am still practicing how to create Critical Path, but i exactly understood how to do that. Thank you for super detailed explanation.
This a great course with an even great instructor. The coursework is very easy to understand the way it is delivered is very good.
I am very pleased with the content of this course and the professionalism of Margaret Meloni on all her explanations. Thank you!
Very detailed course. I recommend this course to those who are practicing project management in their career and personal life.
I loved the course layout how it was developed to ensure that every detail of scheduling and budgeting was covered efficiently.
