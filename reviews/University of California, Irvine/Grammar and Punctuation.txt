You should tell people before they enroll that, to take the quizzes, they must pay. It was a waste of time...
The course is great, but I am very disappointed that after spend 3 hours watching the videos and practicing, I can only submit my answer if I upgrade. This should be said before I enrolled in this course.
the peer grading system is poor, considering that they are learning just like us.the grading should be done automatically or by a professional .
Its a very basic course and I regret having paid 44 USD for it. I was expecting something more advanced. It goes at such a low pace, I would recommend it for someone who has no clue about english grammar or who is just learning the language. Not for someone who is looking for a more complex grammar used in academic writing.
A very weak course, gives very little knowledge of grammar, doesn't really explain quite a lot of things. If you are a first year primary school student, this course might be helpful, otherwise a complete waste of time.
I dont want to pay money .why the hell is it asking money😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😢😢😢😢😡😡😡😡 i want my certificate
This course has been very frustrating.  I have posted but  have not received any peer reviews.  I am auditing the course so I don't expect a certificate, but to not be able to have quizzes marked is annoying.  Now in week 3 I am expected to change my online viewing platform part way through the course.  These annoyances are such that I am withdrawing from this course and will look to another source for this information.  I have really enjoyed Coursera programs that I have taken in the past, so I hope this course is anomaly and not the norm for other courses.

Le doy una estrella porque los cuestionarios están cerrados a no ser que pagues, así que eso de "todos los contenidos del curso gratis" es mentira. Y si es un error, tampoco responden.Aun así el curso es muy interesante y muy útil de cara a mejorar nuestra redacción en inglés. Vale la pena realizarlo aunque no podamos saber los resultados de los test y por tanto no podremos cerrar el curso, una lástima.
This is awesome. every thing is so amazing, but the one thing I didn't like is the people who are not american or understand English well don't understand what the teachers are saying. the next thing that I didn't like is the test can be done only three times and if we didn't pass in three times then we need to wait eight hours to re do the test. the test are also too hard.THANK YOU
I expected more from this course than what I can find on websites. It is disappointingly shallow. The course is very slow and fails to give a fuller picture.  It is nothing like a university course should be. This sure doesn't help me become better at writing in English.
Nothing as I was expecting. Courses need to have more exercises rather than peer graded assignments. No one does the peer graded assignments properly which makes it a complete waste of time. Don't waste your money and time here.
Horrible subscription policy....You stole my money....How can you continuously extract money? Even I didn't take this course continuously. You should inform and stop the credit card billing... What the fuck worst policy!!!!
Course is good, but even I got free enrollment, I can not pass any quiz because it's locked. They said we need to pay to could take exam, but I'am still student without scholarship and can't pay.
Really disappointed you have to pay to be able to do the quizzes.  I thought the whole point of Coursera is to enhance our skills for free and chose to pay for a certificate if we wanted to.
mal me siguen cobrando cuando ya termine el curso hasta el certificado ya lo tengo desde el abril 11 del 2020 y ya estamos a junio 18 2020 donde me siguen cobrando cada mes
Great experience, but I am feeling the problem to receive certificate. You are asking for id verification. So I am giving you 1 star.
O certificado não é carimbado então não posso usar em minha universidade, fiquei decepcionada, mas o conteúdo de aprendizagem é bom.
It's really very effective course for me.Thanks a lot to authority for giving me a scope to attain this kind of course
i dont know why, but it's so frustrating that i have problem with this course. i can't start every quiz in week 4.
İt is too simple, and it is too short that all course content can be finished in just one day.
I enrolled accidentally to this course. Now i am not able to un enroll. Please help me.
material was good but it doesn't tell you to pay for the course until you take the quiz
They charged again even the course was completed and there is no option to cancel
This course only works if u pay, which is shit coz most people dont have money...
I don't agree with being forced to have peer discussion  on a remedial course.
I can't get my completion certificate and my free trial ends today!!!!!!!!
Course could have earn my stars.Money, money, money is not the way to go.
Me gustaria cancelar este curso, me pueden ayudar
i really don't like this course... time waste
I am happy for participating this  course
very very very very very bad
It most be more effective
It has no continuity.
Kevalamana course da
Monótono y aburrido.
Hard course.

I think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course. The students with very basic level of English have to study with advanced non-native speakers and with natives. The exercises can be too challenging for the first category, sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third.
This course is pretty basic. As far as grammar goes, it really only covers tenses and parallel agreement. I'm also pretty there is more to punctuation than the semicolon and the comma, although I didn't realize how complicated comma placement could be! The professor talks like she's on tranquilizers and it's difficult to do peer reviews when 90% of the class apparently doesn't speak English as their first language. I learned some things, but this course should really be called "How and when to use a comma". Would anyone really pay money for this?
In fact the course is fantastic. I'd say that is perfect, but it is not because requires payment to be assessment in the activities.
I believe this course might be helpful for English learners who have not yet grasped more specific areas of the language (such as different types of sentences) and for natives who haven't had much writing advice throughout their lives. I did learn new things, but they were often presented in a monotone and vague way, with few exercises and a weak approach. Moreover, the editing of the videos was outdated, which, as shallow as it may sound, contributed to my disengagement with this course. There were, however, useful tips and rules I was not aware of, mostly because I tend to apply my native language's punctuation practices to English. Those were certainly a delight to learn, and I'm happy to have had access to it. Even so, I still believe most of it could have been taught more quickly through articles than a whole university-level course.
Fair, if English is your first language. Overly complicated if you are learning English as a second language. The examples are overly complicated using negatives and irregular verbs. The video of Therefore vs Therefore was an improvement over the barely animated videos before it. The one after is overly animated. While the instructor is clear, her examples are difficult to follow and combine many features of English that are not explained. I am passing over other course offerings from this instructor.
Contents are interesting and useful, even if the course deals with few topics. I think it is too expensive! A good grammar book is cheaper and more complete.I would not enroll this course anymore.
Poor visual communications, it should be better since it is the only way to follow the course.Should be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about.
Very good course! All explanations are clear and too powerful for understanding.Two stars because all tests you can submit if purchase certificate.
The class itself is quite good. However you can not submit the Module Quiz without purchasing the certificate, which is quite annoying.
This course is very interesting and enjoyable .I advise any one wanna learn english grammar to start with this course.
The theoretical part is good, but a lot of exercises just haven't opened. I don't feel like I've had enough practice.
It was a good course. But it doesn't worth the money. Paying $69 is just too much for this elementary course.
It is good, but still needs an improvement. It should be able to train the students in their profession
None of the practice exercises worked.
Extremely boring and not really useful
Great and free.
satisfactory
Review comments:What I learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in Week 4.[Parallel Structure]It uses some conjunctions like and, but, both....and..., not only...but also...[Sentence Variety]Use the different 4 types English sentence style, simple, compound, complex and compound-complex to enrich your writing. In addition, adverbs, prepositional phrases (like in the morning), other transitions (furthermore) could be used to create variety. At last, combining the short sentences, medium sentences (10-15 words) and long ones (20-40 words) will also make your writing alive. Some other    tips will also help like repeating key nouns, using synonyms, saying things in different ways.- Use different sentence types- Start sentence differently- Use different sentence lengths- Use synonyms effectivelyConsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay, so do not do it in the begining.
Good course, although no proctor or supervision at all. No place to go for questions or help. Please be aware this is primarily designed for non-native english speakers. This was not clear to me when I joined. And although the content is thorough, it is dull and the assignments uninspiring. If you want to know more about grammar, good  (be sure to bone up through, because she assumes a lot about what you might remember from high school and for those of us over 40 ... hmmm).If you want to feel inspired to write something of value and interest to yourself or others, not so good.Over all I would not recommend this course or series of courses. And would suggest seeking out a course that has some kind of proctor or supervisory help available.
This course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tenses contributes relatively little to typical academic writing. Rather, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review. But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to pracital writing. It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to "the" or not to "the"). It is helpful to include this component too.
Good Course for examining some English Grammar closelyThe course breaks down some aspects of English grammar and punctuation very nicely and has relevant practice exercises. I wish the course covered a slightly wider variety of topics or went into slightly more depth of explanation. The title "grammar and punctuation" is misleading in that only a few topics are covered. However, I believe someone learning English or reviewing academic writing would definitely benefit from going through this course. I am a native speaker, and I certainly learned a few things. :)Thank you Professor, TA's and Coursera!
It's a good course with some interesting resources. Most of the practice resources use Flash and one of the assignment submissions is inconsistent with the other submission formats. The content of the course itself is 4.5 stars. For me there is one element that I wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it. Instead I'll need to search the internet for an answer and hope what I find is correct!
I think this is a good review for someone who has the basic in English grammar; however, if you're an ESL student or English-speaking person (who need to start over in grammar). Study first before starting this course. A lot of the feedback in the forum, I found to be poor except when it came from an English-speaking person.You get a lot of: " OK, Great, etc..", no real feedback.
I would have liked some more depth in the course.  While the course name says "punctuation", it deals only with commas and to a small extent, with semicolons.  The assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher.  Also, given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe, it should mention that the "serial comma" is not mandatory in all writing styles.
The course is helpful but incomplete. It does not mention dashes and colons. It also misrepresents the usage of semicolons. I have seen the idea of using a semicolon followed by a transition word taught before, but I do not think I have ever seen it done in published writing in my entire life. It strikes me as being pretentious, something to be discouraged.
Very good in punctuation and some points but it doesn't teach a lot of grammar as the title is, the training links are pretty old, and they use other sites, so it wasn't easy to use them. Good course for writing skill, anyway, it's so good for good English talkers, who doesn't trust their English writing skill.
A good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar. The lectures are well presented and the exercises useful. The element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review. This seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).
A solid course for those who require a refresher on certain grammar rules. But, in my opinion, the course should go deeper in the different parts of the English grammar. For example, what are gerunds or infinitives? Still a good course though! I really enjoyed the teacher, as well.
The level of this course is way more basic than I expected. The reviews left previously did not succeed my expectations. It might be an interesting course for someone that is starting to write in English and wishes to have extra knowledge in a very collateral way.
The course is well structured, but most of the features in the exercises' pages were not working properly. I tried to access them via both my computer (macbook) and mobile phone, but in some cases I could not even complete the exercise or check the answers...
This course was informative and valuable although lacking in character and not particularly engaging.  (a Ben-Stein-Bueller aura if you know what I mean). But if you have the patience and desire to really learn this stuff, it will suffice.
Very okay. I would have liked to see more video content and quizzes, rather than reading. This is a good review on the basics of grammar and punctuation, but I think you should already have some background in this before taking it.
The course is conducted well. But it can be improved better. Some reading materials, however, is not that useful and some videos are useless... More useful tips can be put into this course, it is kind of easy...
Some exercises were freezing up despite using firefox as recommended. Some long questions were not completely visible, as they slide cut them off. Otherwise, the sessions were beneficial in everyday writing.
It was great but I can't continue it because I am from Iran and living there too so I can't pay and enroll next courses :( It was just like a great starter with no purpose for me.
Esta bien el curso, pero hay cosas que no explican del todo y muchos links externos para leer, no se motiva realmente al estudiante a escribir y que otros estudiantes corrijan.
The information was quite was good, but the practice and assignments were too easy. Thanks for providing full explanations and a set of in-video examples for every rule.
Algunas funciones no trabajan adecuadamente, envío mis tareas y no se registra, eso hace que no pueda avanzar.  No existe un soporte que ayude a resolver los problemas.
It provides essential information neither about punctuation nor about grammar. I would say it is too superficial. Advanced learners will not gain new knowledge.
Nice brush up on some long-lost grammar rules. Could have been a bit more challenging considering it was created by a University of California school.
It could review some aspects from conditional sentences. In addition, there should be the option of doing the practice exercises in Safari or Chrome.
I wish that the lessons could have gone a bit more in depth and have more abilities to give the students practice or interactions with instructors.
Although it should be simple enough, i found it hard to understand the material and sometimes, the videos would end without finishing the content.
I couldn't finish it without purchasing it, in spite of active participation and high scores on all the assignments I had access to.
Great explanation of punctuation rules. However, upgrade costs too much given the amount of materials covered and their complexity.
Lectures must be more interactive. The practice sheets must not be limited to Firefox users, it should function on Chrome as well.
I had a good time learning new things which are generally not told in your academics.Thanks to UCI for offering it. Best wishes.
It was alright. Thought I would learn more than that, but I'm very thankful for learning about comma structure and so on.
In my opinion, this course needs more space for English grammar, or make a new course for grammar only.thank you
The practise tests were only compatible with firefox. In this day and age, very few people use firefox.
Thanks a lot for all things i already learned from this course. Really, l filtrate this to all people.
More detailed explanation is needed on the course, and if a teacher is available it would be good
The examples and teaching videos are excellent. But, there should be more exercises for practice.
The course doesn't cover some of the punctuations but overall its a great course to start with.
Acho bastante monótono e tradicional. Contudo, é explicado de modo simples e funcional.
The content was best but supporting supplementary reader doesn't worked at all.
It was overall, alright. All of the group assignments killed it for me, though.
Most of the practise assignments didn't run either on Safari or on Chrome.
It was a good start, but I wish the assignments were a little bit harder.
It was a good course. Now, I am very much confident about punctuation.
i recommend making a video at the end of course to summary the course
I have acquired a diverse knowledge on grammar and punctuation.
Good videos on grammar and punctuation but not much on writing.
Very good course. Interesting tips and summaries. Very helpful.
American English as opposing my knowledge of British English.
Very good; however, the training apps did not work on my Mac.
it is very nice course, and improve my english writting style
It was really helpful for me to advance my punctuation skill
It would be useful if we get feedbacks from the lecturers.
Must pay to sign up in order to submit final quizzes, etc.
It's a good course, In the last lesson miss more examples.
Very useful and the information taught are well presented
The videos are really boring, however the course is good.
good to learn it's easy and useful i like it very much
very good platefrom  to learn grammar and Punctuation
A good basic course with some great exercises in it.
The first week I liked, but the last week doesn't.
The exercices didn't work ,and I could not do them
Some of the lessons aren't clear enough to follow
Good teaching and making every topic practice
Verb tenses could be explained more detailed.
got the idea of using punctuation in writing
EXCELLENT COURSE. I HAVE ENJOYED THE COURSE.
Short course.Please add more content to it.
Not very challenging, but well constructed
need more material.. course is too simple
Requires payment to complete the course.
Good for a starter.Thank you professor.
It was ok but not so clear at the end
I think Punctuacion is the main topic
Too too too too too TOO repetitive.
Feedback from teachers is lacking.
good way to go back to the basics
it was interesting and helpful.
Short course but well organize.
Some of the apps did not work.
Kind of... too basic?
It is useful course.
I HAVEN'T ENJOYED

Please add a forum so that people can share their thoughts; this kind of course requires lots of general discussion!
First of all, thank you very much for putting this course together. I have just finished it, and I decided to leave this assignment for last since I wanted to share some general comments.Overall, I have learned a few new details here and there, including certain new ways of explaining the use of some structures and punctuation rules. It was very good for me to review the notion of "sentence compound" and "verb compound".My general observations about this course are:(1) It offers a very basic notion of verb tenses without any in-depth analysis of certain special or more complex situations. I guess I was expecting the chance to explore some more details in this course.(2) There were different moments where I disagreed about the use of commas recommended by the instructor. My disagreement was based on the writing guidelines I have learned throughout my life while attending courses/workshops offered by professional editors and university professors as well as while studying different materials (grammar books and writing handbooks. (Please see a list with some titles below.)(2.1) One case refers to the use or not of commas with Relative Clauses. As you may be well aware, commas should only be used with nonrestrictive clauses whereas restrictive clauses are never separated by commas. However, some sentences shown in the video "More Uses of Commas" as well as in the quizzes failed to make such distinction.Two examples from the video:(A) "My roommate, who hates seafood, doesn't want me to cook shrimp." [In this example, the use of commas is correct if I assume that there is only one roommate in this situation, which is clearly identified. Therefore, the relative clause is nonrestrictive as it is just adding extra information about the roommate.](B) "The dress, which I bought for tonight, is too tight for me to wear."[Here we have a very general subject "the dress", and we need the relative clause to help us identify which dress the speaker is talking about. Therefore, the relative clause is clearly a restrictive clause and should not be separated by commas.](2.2) Another situation that I somewhat disagreed with was with the rule about adding a comma before "and" in a series of three or more things/people/phrases etc. This last comma (aka "series comma", "serial comma", or even "Oxford comma") is actually "debatable" among many different authors. In general, it is considered an optional case, not a mandatory one.(3) In the video about Present Perfect and Simple Past, we were shown a table divided into two columns/sides: on the left, there were words normally used with Present Perfect, and on the right, words that were used with only Simple Past.(3.1) Among the words normally used with Present Perfect, we had already, ever, yet, never.However, as we all know, we can perfectly use either Present Perfect or Simple Past for new or recent happenings, especially in North America and in informal situations.For example:- I've lost my keys. Have you seen them?        OR    I lost my keys. Did you see them?The same applies to the words previously mentioned in bold as well as always, just, before:- I have already called Martha.   OR   I already called Martha.- Have you contacted Martha yet?    OR    Did you contact Martha yet?- I've never spoken to him.       OR   I never spoke to him.- Have you ever seen anything like that before?    OR   DId you ever see anything like that before?There would be some other things to say, but I believe that is enough for now.Thank you very much for this course in any case. I am sure most of my peers are learning a lot from it. :)
This is a great introductory course for refreshing one's memory or learning basic grammar rules. Unfortunately, the 7-day free trial option does not allow the same level of access to the discussion board assignments as those students who pay for the course. Based on my experience, my classmates were unable to see the content that I posted; however, I was able to provide feedback and add private comments to their posts. Also, with the free version, some of the supplemental practice exercises did not open, but all of the lecture videos, quizzes, and course assignments functioned properly. If you are taking the course as a refresher, then you can make it through the class before the free trial period ends, just note that it does take some time to watch all of the videos and complete the assignments. If you don't want to rush, the course is inexpensive, and the content is worth it.
This course is really helpful especially for people wanting to write English articles better. The course outline is well laid out, videos are easy to understand, and exercises are very helpful for practicing your punctuation.  The only negative point for me is how the teachers use a very strong American accent that some of the letters in a word are not pronounced anymore, like 'meanin' instead of 'meaning' and 'writin' instead of 'writing'. It doesn't really affect the teaching, though. All in all, this course helped me a lot and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their punctuation and review their English grammar knowledge.
Even though the course was pretty basic, there were many new things I learned, especially certain tips and tricks. The lessons are simple; the examples were good for understanding and to the point. The course-content, video and audio qualities are good. Links to extra materials are also provided towards the end of each week. I felt the assignments were too simple. They were reviewed by other students and not by the course organisers. Though peer-review is a good practice, comments from the teachers would be much appreciated. I would prefer more options for discussion on a topic, other than through the assignments alone.
It was such a nice decision to take up this course.  I have had a desire to know more about punctuation , and this was exactly what I have wanted. The study load was fairly enough, so it was easy to manage my progress on my own even if I got off work late.If I am allowed to talk about downsides, I wish there was more active communication with the professors. I felt comunication with students was not enough.Moreover, some study material was not able to be opened. I presume those links were expired.Overall, it was satisfactory.
I really liked this course. It helped me to understand about some grammar rules that I didn't understand before, and also made me learn new things. The methodology is so interisting, it made me search more and more information about the English grammar before I submit or analyse any classmate activities, because I wanted to make sure that I was doing it properly. To be honest, it is not 5 star, for me, because I believe that if it had  a specialised tutor,  I could feel more confident about my learning.
This course is very good with helping the learner punctuate, use the correct tenses, and form sentences with appropriate sentence structure. I would suggest making the practice exercises available in Chrome, as well. I would also suggest external monitoring of the peer-graded assignments, because if everybody is a learner, it is not necessary that everybody will critique correctly. In addition, I think most people would do the assignments out of obligation, and not out of the need to learn and review.
This is should be your go to option if you are looking for brushing up / learning fundamentals of english grammar. The course material is simple , to the point and accessible to a all regardless of the level of your English fluency levels. However, this course lacks a an active discussion forum and the peer graded assignments are designed in such a way that often it is impossible to discuss doubts or explore further nuances . Other than that, the course meets all that it sets out to achieve.
Instruction was clear and helpful. The practice questions were useful while learning. Some of the practice sessions were not available to me because I use Google Chrome as my browser. I also thought one of the peer review sections should be changed to match the others. The one lesson asked us to upload a file instead of just typing our responses in a box. Overall, good class. I definitely needed a refresher course, and this helped me to remember what I had learned.
It is an excellent platform to improve our English with enormous number of examples and practice items. It is a good way to improve the communication with people all over the globe. This improvise the confidence level, too, for a non-native English speaker. However, I was expecting to interact with the class teacher, as I wanted to confirm my understanding with her too. There is no option available where we can ask our doubts, except the initial week.
Very useful and straightforward course on the basics of grammar (but just the basics of Verb Tenses; was expecting more of it in terms of grammar topics - Passive voice, Conditionals, Reported speech etc.)It's basically a Punctuation 101 course which focuses heavily on proper sentence structure and syntax - got a great deal a good stuff out of it, though. Warmly recommend it to everyone who is not confident in his basic writing skills.
The course makes you learn:a) when you have to use Simple Past or Present Perfect;b) punctuationc) how to write in clear way.There are problems with IT platform: video often stops suddenly and sometimes it is difficult to understand where you are arrived in the course. Besides, sometimes you don't immediately understand what you have to do for passing to next step of the course.To sum up, the teacher is good. IT staff could do better.
I would rate this course with 5 stars; however, I think that an introduction to verbs, nouns and adjectives is a necessary component. In order to grasp the first module about verb tenses, I had to do some background research on different grammatical structures. I wish that this had been covered in the beginning. I have found the given resources to be quite valuable, and I am looking forward to enrolling in the essay writing course.
I appreciate the comments from other students (it helps me a lot), but I dont fell like I'm either very  or well prepared to avaliate the work of others. So, this is my only one negative point. Despite the fact we needed to move to another page or navigator, I  really enjoyed doing the extra exercises. At last, I think would be better that those extra exercises were here on coursera platform. That's all.
Before I started this course, I used to do a lot of guess work while editing my essays. I relied on proofreading program to get review my essays. This course has helped me understand crucial parts of sentences; thereby, enabling me with greater confidence to edit my essays.Although this course is intended for beginners, it would certainly help experienced hands refresh their skills. Try it!
This was a very helpful course. I learnt punctuations, transition words, conjunctions, essay writing, parallel writing and various other topics that will improve my writing style. Initially, they asked an introductory question which I was facing some trouble to write. But after this course i feel confident in writing, not only an introductory paragraph, but any paragraph or essay.
It's a pleasure to thank UCLA for teaching for everyone to learn to acquire a new language.Secondly, I thank all the working teachers who carry on their shoulders the most honorable message throughout history, hoping that knowledge will reach the corners of the earth.and a next times we are want to courses about information technology for develoe our skills until find job easily.
Paced perfectly for me.  A great review as my knowledge of what underlies our language system is well hidden after years of use.  As I embark upon a class in Spanish, I hope this thorough look at English conventions may help me in learning this second language.  My motivation centers on my grandson's enrollment in a dual immersion school; helping him with homework is a challenge.
It was great. But would have been better if watching additional videos was not made mandatory for firefox. And providing extra material for practicing would be nice, for we could make our base on grammar & punctuation stronger that way. Overall I am happy with this course and Instructor. The course was well organized. Only lacuna I find is post material for practicing.
This is really good. I expected a tedious review of my grammar subjects from grade school and high school. I am pleasantly relieved that the emphasis is on the areas that will be commonly used in academic writing; that is, sentence constructions. I have learned a lot and have also discovered that my compound and complex sentence constructions do need some work.
from this class,it made me  proper man on doing in making the sentences right, like this is this and that's that; however, this class was cool where i got more knowledge than the school in LTC ( grammar) subject! by seeing the videos that this class had made and i understand,but something i didn't then also i got more knowledge than i thought . THANK YOU !
This course was great. I only subtracted 1 star because coursera’s peer review system was a little clunky. I wanted to ask follow up questions or thank peers for their feedback but didn’t seem to be able to. I’m also not sure The “discuss” button underneath the lecture video rectangle also didn’t work so I couldn’t discuss any of the content with peers.
Overall, it was good. This course has cohesive content, but, what I feel, something is missing. It is a very short course, they have another intermediate course on grammar, though. They should include some faculty interaction in this course, as we all are at the same pace. We can't judge other person mistakes as a teacher can do this job better than us.
A concise review of punctuation and (some) grammar associated with punctuation rules in the grammar. A perfect choice for anyone wanting to review punctuation rules swiftly. However, those who would like to review grammar of the English language might not get all what they wanted from this course, which covers only what is relevant to punctuation.
A really helpful and detailed course. You really can go trough it for four hours and gain quite useful knowledge about the punctuation and the correct way of structuring your essay. The only recommendation  I would have is to give up on the adobe flash technology for the practice tests and use java script and simple html.Thanks for the course.
Very good step-by-step pedagogy! Learn a few things, that I will keep in mind. But, I believe this is for beginners, or people who have big issues with grammar. I can imagine this is also very good for people whose native language has nothing in common with English. I was playing the videos 2x faster, as I had understood where this was going.
I enjoyed this course. Highly educational and useful. I had so much fun following the videos and completing the quizzes. I'd say I had improved a lot since I started. The problem is, some of the practicing apps in the course don't work, which made me frustrated. I hope they fix them, so the students can get the full potentials of the course.
I was looking for a course that can sum up my knowledge regarding grammar and punctuation. For this purpose, I found the Grammar and Punctuation course is the best fit. The whole program was great; I liked the interactive learning section. The video contents seems a bit brief to me, except this, I loved this course. Thank you.
This course is a great refreshment about Grammar and a helpful guide about Punctuation. The materials are very easy to understand. What i really like about this course is that it is very informative without being too long. The quiz could be improved since it is only fully accessible via a certain browser. Thank you, Coursera!
A good course for everyone who already knows grammar but wants to revise everything. Also, it does an amazing job at clarifying your doubts regarding the most difficult aspects of English grammar. However, this is not a course for zero level beginners because it does expect you to know basic concepts already before enrolling.
The course is very helpful, and the instructor communicates very efficiently with the students. There is only one problem that some of the links in the course are only accessible through desktop and not through smartphone. But that's only a miner issue, which I am certain that the technical team would resolve quickly.
This is a good course for learning English as a second language, and I learned a few things, but if you're looking to learn advanced grammatical concepts in English, I would recommend other classes above this one. This course has a lot of useful exercises and interaction with your classmates, which are very helpful.
The best feature of the course is that it was well organized and of highly advanced level. The material in tutorial was appropriate and it increased my interest in the given field. At - last, but not least the instructor deliver the course contents in an efficient wy. She also dealt the problems of all the peers.
It was an excellent refresher course. The course included a lot of student reviews. In my opinion there was a plus and a negative to this. It was great at inspiring student interaction; however, because the teacher didn't review the work after, if the student had a misguided interpretation it may lead you astray.
I enrolled hoping to learn more about other punctuation marks, such as: how to place periods when you have a quote, since in Spanish these rules are different and I keep making the same mistakes, or how to use the dash. However, it's a nice short course where I learned a lot about Parallel Structures and commas.
There's some room for improvement, that's for sure. The last video was really bad, not because of the content, but because the Professor was very sloppy in her speaking. I also think there should be more practice exercises and a better way to know if the answers were correct. But overall, was very happy with it.
It was not what I was looking for, but it helped me review some of the basics that I had forgotten. Explanations were very clear and to the point. However, the practice activities didn't work, so I had to then practice on the other major Grammar-based websites. Thank you for the effort in putting this course.
It is a good course; gives an overview about tenses and a detailed training about how and when to use punctuation correctly. It also talks about the 4 types of sentences and how to use them effectively while writing. It enhances my understanding of the subject matter and boost my confidence for the same.
Maybe, I missed the information about this course being focused towards non-native speakers. Was this course focus to that target audience? As a native-English speaker, I found this course a bit easy. However, I enjoyed the refresher, and I will use this information in future courses. Thank you!
I enjoyed this course a lot. This is my first course in coursera, also I am very confused with English sentence formation. Now, I learnt a lot and will try to apply the most of this knowledge practically. I, also wished to have prepositions part in this, which is only disappointment for me.
Thanks for providing us this opportunity. It was a very nice course. There are few things which might help improve the course:- For a four-weeks course, I feel the material was not enough. I feel there is room to add more items like the use of hyphens, colons, and determiners.Thanks again.
A beginners course for writing correct English sentences. The course carries a good amount of examples to practice which proves really helpful. Though some of the exercise through the links are not loading. Overall, a great course to start with if you wish to revise your basic English.
The course was excellent! But I think you can focus on other important aspects of punctuation or grammar (like run-on sentences). On the other hand, when doing the peer assignment, I think the way students give feedback each other could be improved. Above all, I'd recommend the course.
The material in this course is super helpful, but I wished there would be weekly discussion forums to discuss the problems with the weekly materials. Also, the practice exercise links do not work most of the time. Nothing is displayed at the page after clicking on the link.
This course provides a very good introduction on punctuation and parallel sentences. Also, it introduces how to write good essay. My suggestion would be that the course could reduce sometime in the week1 learning and add more content in the sentences writing. Thank you.
I can see the improvement in myself and in the other students in the peer reviews. This course took me a little by surprise by how fun it was, I hadn't expected it. I recommend this course, especially to foreigners who want to learn how to use the English language.
The course was very good, but we are missing the help center and the discussion board.I finished the course and still didn't find the Group discussion icon. The help center is not active at all. Also, I have no clue why the search engine in the Arabic language.
It was helpful to review the grammar I have accumulated throughout the years.The punctuation rules are surprisingly interesting. I never really looked into the stuff so this was also useful, especially since I'm really particular about my essay presentation.
It’s a very useful course, but peer-graded-system is not a good idea for English beginners. Some people give good advices, but others don’t have skills to give correct advices. Some advices were rather confusing. Taking quiz is better than peer-graded one.
I wished at first they will let you practice before asking if we have any questions, also i never  knew if what i said to the others students was correct or no, regarthless i really like the structure of the course and the lectures were also very helpful.
Great course on the basics of good grammar and Punctuation. I feel there is a lot more to grammar than what is provided; however, this is a great start for anyone looking to polish up on verb tenses, basic sentence structure and punctuation.
I would be better if we can interchange comments with classmates when someone grades a task. Because, they can leave a message about the mistakes but you can't reply them. Which doesn't allow us to make feedback or ask them about the grade.
Good course! Don't be leave the course if the pre-course test results suggest you may be too good for the course. The grammar part was a review for the most part, but the punctuation section taught me a good deal of the rules I didn't know.
This course is simple and easy to follow. The lesson that had a great impact on me was about commas. When I learned about it's proper usage, I realized how long I'd been using commas in the wrong way! Thank you UC Irvine for this course! ;)
I found this course very useful and instructive. I finally could learn some rules which my teachers were never able to clearly explain to me. It is only a pity that I could not receive a certificate of attendance without paying the fee...
It was fun learning however, the criteria should be strict when us learners are answering questions and not give us second chances to correct ourselves. Secondly,Would the certificate be useful if I want to apply outside my own country?
Well taking this course helps me a lot in my academic writing and it's full of knowledge. As you know am a writer and that course is really interesting and I gain skills on that. Now i feel comfortable and i enjoy writring. Thank a lot
This was a great refresher course for me. It has been quite a few years since I studied grammar and punctuation, and I found that I had forgotten certain rules. My only problem was with some technical glitches. Otherwise, great course.
The course focuses on some of the most important aspects of English grammar which are used frequently. Also, these are the topics where students tend to make mistakes. However, few additional topics could have been added to the course
It was a good experience. Even though I'm an undergraduate student, these were some basic knowledge I was not completely aware of. I might have forgotten many rules. This helped me to strengthen my foundation. I do had a great time.
Thoroughly enjoyed and it helped me reconnect with some of the theories taught many many years ago. It took a few attempts in some parts.there were some technical issues with some of the practice modules. I reported these. Thanks.
I found this course very helpful. I didn't know the 99% of the information before taking this course. I highly recommend Grammar and punctuation for all whom need to improve their writting skills in a easy and understandable way.
This was a very well done course with many different ways to practice the skills being taught. There are a few bugs in the assignment section, particularly in week 4, that impacted students' ability to review one anothers' work.
The course has been very useful in writing sentences correctly and using different forms of sentences. Although fluent in english speaking I was weak in grammer. This helped me a lot to get through and gain information.
The course is well explained and covers the topic nicely, however, a prior knowledge of grammar and punctuation is required. The instructor has clear pronunciation and a smile on her face that makes learning enjoyable.
I found it to be enjoyable, the teacher lectures where well understood and I also enjoyed the test. I had enough information that also helped me to take down notes. I have recommended few of my friends. Thank you all.
I enjoyed this course very much. However, I miss feedback!Maybe it's because I did the free course and did not pay. But, sometimes I still don't understand why I did something wrong.As an introduction this is perfect.
Excellent course to refresh the English Grammar and its Punctuation. An overview to students who want to understand the fundamentals of the English Language and utilize the content as a reference for upcoming studies.
Course is very good but there are few things I want UCI to improve. Include discussion forums, update those practice links since they are outdated and not working and finally, I wanted last week to be more elobrated.
Hello,The overall content or education on English grammar was good. It made me to correct lot of things which I used to find difficult or project it wrong. Thank you for educating me correctly. Appreciate your work.
It was an good experience by learning this course ..it will help in my career ..and also for others ..thank you the instructor who explained very easy way to understand all grammar andpunctuation ...good course ...
I liked this course, but it required some explanation. To be more accurate, the last week in the course needs more effort to look perfect. However,  I have learned a lot from the instructor, and she added me much.
I liked very much this course. I had forgot many of these grammatical rules, so it was really good for me. As in any other language, English is not easy, you have to practice daily, even that be just a little bit.
I love it ,thank you so much for your information.I just want to comment a bout one thing, I couldn't open some links during the course, by the way , I am using laptop so I think the problem is technical problem
Thank you, Coursera, for this beautiful platform of enhancing our knowledge and understanding. This was the first course that I completed. I am glad to say that it was a great help to extend my understanding.
Great course for students who need to polish their English or refresh some grammar and punctuation. I'm a teacher of ESL,  and I got new sources to explain punctuation, conjunctions and tenses to my students.
this course is very organized and helpful. I learned many important things, indeed. In addition, writing is always a tricky part for me, but now I am confident that I will do good, after doing this course.
I liked it, you will get an introduction to grammar rules with a focus on punctuation.
I had expected more writing practice. In a couple of
weeks, I might sign up for the next level of this specialization.
The course is well structured. It focuses on the key aspects which one needs to learn and focus on for improving his/ her English writing skills. The focus on verb and tenses can be a bit more extensive.
On week 4, one of the assignments did not allow us to write in answers directly and had to save it as a word document etc. This was very inconvenient. I hope you change this requirement in other courses!
This course provided the basics in English grammar and punctuation. The lecturer gives a lot of good examples and provides the learners with enough opportunities to practice whatever is being discussed.
it was a great course, it helped me a lot reviewing my English grammar. I appreciate for everything and I will recommend this  course to everyone who wants to write better the English language. Thanks
This is the perfect course for either people who want a refresher on grammar and punctuation or for people who speak english as a second language and were never taught sentence structuring in school.
I am really satisfied with this course. With the help of this course , I have improved my English writing skills. I have learned a lot of new things, and I am really glad that I took up this course.
The terminology is likely to be difficult for ESLs, and the guidance is likely too easy for native speakers.Spent most of the time on 2.0x speed and multitasking because it wasn't nuanced enough.
This is my first time in Coursera, and I am amazingly impressed by this toolkit. However, some features for the commas and sentence variety practice test did not pop up. I hope it can be fixed.
this course really helped me increase my knowledge about writing  grammatically correct sentences and paragraphs , if you are looking to increase your level of writing , this course is for you.
Very good, But I missed some more practical exercises on writing. For us, non-native english speakers sometimes it is very difficult to identify our mistakes. But the whole module is very good.
As beginner in research area this is first milestone in academic writing, I have read and done lots of online courses. This provide better understanding with proper style and learning method.
It is really exciting course though I failed two times to complete it. I think the instructor voice should br mo cleared.This is informative but need more clear the section. Thanks, Coursera.
The course is so helpful which reminds me a lots of grammar and word uses. However, I find it inconvenient when I need to use Firefox in some lessons. Chrome will be preferred, in my opinion.
Very Much Useful to Student Community, particularly when these are given in form of assignments to student groups. the videos are interesting at the same time it gives a joy of Fun  Learning
Instructions and actions in some of the practices are neither intuitive nor are they clear.  It appears that some are written with the assumption that a student has taken the class before.
It was a great experience to go through this course. It gave me more insight into the sentence making. I really learned the use of commas and other punctuation, really enjoyed the course.
In my opinion, it was a good course because it was well structured, understandable and easy to follow. Even tough I found it useful, I would like to find more content on english grammar.
The course is great with basic knowledge about the grammar and punctuation.However, it is quite difficult to do the exercise (some files are good, the others have to be done in Firefox)
I recommend this class to anyone willing to know how to punctuate and use correct tenses in English. The grammar rules are clearly explained and illustrated with many helpful examples.
The course is quite informative and useful. However, I think the charge of 60e is too high since the skills introduced are both elementary and limited. 10e would be a proper price.
The course was short and to the point which helped me understanding the use of punctuations specially Comma and semi colon and different types of sentence structures and variety.
The coure is amazing and really helpful! However, not everybody has Firefox, and it is hard to download on the internet, so they may miss the opportunities to take some quizes.
The course is apt for the people who are adept at speaking and amateur in writing. The course definitely improved the way I frame and put out my sentences for readers to read.
I'm very glad to this course, but I suffered to open the links as I'm a mobile user.I request Coursera to work on that issue;provide the links which can be open in phone,too.
It was well categorized and objectified course with proper assessment test. It was great to interact a few of the people from all over the world. Thank you MOOC and Coursera
A simple introduction to grammar and punctuation that is well laid out and easy to understand. I explored this course as a refresher, and it served that purpose quite well!
This course is very useful as It covers the essentials of English grammar. It's help me out of the explosion of grammar rules by presenting them in a combinatorial manner.
when i started this course , i dont know much about conjuctions,transitions,parallel sentence formation ;however, now i am able to understand those grammer punctuations
This was an excellent review of previous grammar courses I have taken, covering information that will be useful in continuing with the Academic Writing specialization.
Good enough for students who know a little about English writing, but it is a little too easy for international students who have already begun their study in America.
Mostly basic stuff. This is well structured and easy to follow and understand. However, if you are looking for advance grammar and punctuation course, this is not it.
The course didactics it is very good ;however, it is not easy for beginners the exercises are difficult to understand for those who do not have a good english base .
Great class. Some slides show awful colors. I think that could be improved. Also professional transition betwixt slides could give the course a more "polished" look.
one of the most amazing courses as I've learned a lot . I did not face any problems understanding the teacher or the info. Thank you so much for your great efforts.
I was an awesome course. Week 1 and week 2 was the most helpful. But, I found week 3' and week 4's contents to be given more time than it should be actually given.
This course is really useful, clear and well-organized.It is not only teaching me how to use punctuation correctly, also developing my logical thinking in English.
A very good review on punctuation and tense.  However, I think the course is a little too simple.  I hope that the class could cover more grammar topics in depth.
Content in this course is explained very well and gives one the motivation to learn many skills in a very short time. The quizzes are short and easy to complete.
When I studied English, I didn't give too much attention to puntuation, and this course emphasizes on that. Also, it gives you a complete verb tenses' review.
I enjoyed this course. In order to plan the next step, however, I would like to see a video explaining how all the courses in the Specialization fit together.
I have learned a lot with this course! It's like you are really attending a class, and socializing everyday with your classmates. I really had fun. Thank you!
It was useful to identify my mistakes when using grammar. And i love the way of exercises. But sometimes repeating the same thing. totally I love this course
It was a very useful class for me. A lot of topics, in which I was confused, were clarified during the course. However, not all punctuation rules were given.
I am glad to have learn and understood better what was covered in this class. I think there would have been opportunity to explore grammar even more, deeper.
I think for the homework part could be more challenge, and some of the exercise pages could not be opened. Overall, it is a great course, and I recommended.
I decided to enroll in this course, and it has been a great experience. Definitely, this course met my expectations, and set my knowledge to keep learning.
Very simple and easy to follow instructions. The lessons, exercises, and peer reviews are all interesting. I learned so much from this module. Thank you!
Although the course was too easy for my level, I still liked it. The videos were short and relevant, and the instructor knows how to keep you engaged.
It si a great course! The minor comment, combining the subject of variety of sentences with commas and parallel structures could be a bit overloading.
Great course. I definitely learned a lot. If you have a good grasp on grammar, a lot of this should be review. Overall, a lot of useful information.
The course has been very interesting and useful; however, I would have liked that my homeworks were reviewed by both the teacher and the colleagues.
This course is suitable for beginners. So if you want to start writing and do not have skills, Learning the grammar and punctuation is your answer.
It would be better if you leave more space for the student to communicate with each other, by that, we shall create more opportunities to practice.
Great course for english learners who wanna develop their writing and, especially, for those who still have problem with tenses and punctuation use
Punctuation and basic grammar rules were very beneficial, on the other hand, it would be more essay practice on this course Thanks for this course
The course time was entirely good, and i got the correct grammar once I finished the course. It had been always a pleasure with coursera.Thank you
Good one , some parts was even useful for what I was seeking for - IELTS General WritingFlash Practices and in-Video Questions was interesting too
Some types of assignments and quizes are not comfortable to use. But thas is just about technical issues.Educational part of this course in great.
It's a short and concise course for all learners and teachers of the English language. I've recommended it to my fellow ESL instructors.Thank you.
Excellent course! You can make it even better with concise handouts for every lesson which highlights all the main points for personal future use.
I really want to appreciate all the teachers and Coursera management for such a plate form to provide knowledge and enlightenment beyond borders.
Very helpful course. I liked a lot. Although I would prefer for some quizzes not to be locked unless paid.Thank you for sharing your knowledge.E.
The excellent course I ever found to improve your basics in English. thanks to course era and the excellent team member of this particular class
Very helpful for anyone who hasn't done many grammar courses; However, if you are familiar with grammar rules, then this might be rather boring.
I got a chance to know some types of basic rules of grammar which i didn'tknow. The journey was good. You just need to be patient and confident
This is the best course . I have ever seen before.I am very thankful to my professors of this course and also thankful my peers of this course.
Course , that i throughout enjoyed and learned a lot from it. Only thing, I missed was it do not cover all of the topics ,but only few of them.
It is a very complete overview. It is very helpful for reviewing English grammar and punctuation. The additional resources are also very good.
Good course . This course will help you to learned a lot about grammar and punctuation. And also how to use them in a sentence appropriately.
I loved that course. That taught me how to use punctuation correctly and use sentence variety in my essays. I am proud to complete the course
Some practices did not show up on my computer. There needs to be more examples for each point being presented and more additional resources.
I really liked the course. I thought the instructor could have used a little more excitement or enthusiasm in her delivery but that was it .
This was a very good class and helpful. I only had some issues with not being able to see some things on my app like the practice exercises.
It's interesting. I am unsure if the feedbacks that I give or receive is correct. It would be helpful if someone moderates and verifies it.
The course is good, but I think it will be even better if it covers more about the 16 tenses, more punctuation, and capitalization. Thanks!
If you take this course, you will be able to use commas effectively. In addition, you can know the steps when you write an English essay.
I would have bought the course, but it was very expensive for me. Because of this I didn't have acess to all content and I could't enjoy.
Good course. I would have liked to do more practice excersises since it is different to analyse sentences than to write my own sentences.
The course is great and I improved a lot about the gaps in my English knowledge. However, the additional works sometimes don't work well
Of the English grammar courses I've enrolled to, this is the easiest to understand, not to mention enjoyable. Don't hesitate to enroll!
i have learn a lot from this course. i have an excellent experience of this course.really wonderful i don't have words to define it...
The faculty has explained everything clearly, and the preparation quiz had helped me a lot in knowing how much i learned the concept.
Focused too much on commas. Could have incorporated other grammar elements as well. Nevertheless, a very good, easy-to-follow course.
This course helped me review some concepts of writing I totally forgot. It also introduced me to simple ways to improve my writing.
I like the course. It explain a lot of Punctuation, but I rather prefer that the course have more grammar and Punctuation exercises
It was a great experience. Peer feedbacks were great, and I learnt a lot of things. A lot of other grammar doubts got cleared too.
The overall of this course was great ! Just a pity that the practices provided was often cannot be opened and crashed. Thank you !
I like this course very much! It just shares some simple principle,  which I didn't pay much attention before! I did learn a lot!
Generally, the course is very good and was really useful for me. I just expected that it covers the use of all punctuation marks.
The course content is good.  However, I experienced several technical issues and was unable to access the  practice worksheets.
Very good experience and also went through some tough times to get this job done.So i thank you for this wonderful course time.
I LOVE IT ...THIS COURSE HAS HELPED ME A LOT IN MANY WAYS I WOULD LOVE TO THANK COURSERA FOR GIVING ME THIS BIG OPPORTUNITY !!!
Very helpful as introduction and review of punctuation and verbs. Some technical issues appear for the additional exercises :'(
It is OK if you have learnt grammar and punctuation systematically. Quite glad that it solves some of my doubts in punctuation.
After completing this course,i have a good knowledge on the types of sentences.I have learnt a lot from this course.Thank You..
Great syllabus and useful content but unfortunately some links of the exercises were not working. So please check these links.
This was an easy course, the videos are short, but the suggested material helps to remember lots of "easy to forget concepts".
My only complaint about this course is that some exercises are only available for Mozilla firefox. Aside from that, all good.
This course was really great and I learned so much about different types of sentences and where to use commas and where not.
Thanks for setup this course for learning grammar and punctuation,i hope i have learnt some thing which i have not aware of.
It would be grate if they can offer a course about explanation of more English grammar and Tenses (especially Perfect Tense)
Simple, fast-paced and cohesive. If you want to know your shortcomings in writing, this is the course you need to enroll in.
It's really awesome course. At first, I thought I am wasting my time, but it's worthy. And thanks for this dazzling course.
Many of the links in the practice modules did not work. But otherwise, the class is very informative and a great refresher.
Great course to learn about types of verbs, conjunctions, punctuation (commas), sentence varieties and, parallel structure.
Its a very helpful experience. Highly recommended to others who encounter grammatical and punctuation problem occasionally.
Thanks a lot. I learned some solid stuffs that I mistakenly thought I'd known already. A real eye opener. Thanks a zillion.
Altough I have an intermediate level in English, I have learned how to punctuate correctly sentences. Thank you very much.
Very helpful for students who wants write essay very efficiently and to recollect the grammar in a short time.thank you .
I would rather have been reviewed by a teacher than my peers, and get a real feedback.But i have learnt a lot. Thank you.
This is a good refresher on one's grammar and punctuation. It's an absolute bummer that the quizzes are behind a paywall.
It is a good course for polishing skills; however, excludes usage of several other punctuations which are often confused.
Good lesson for me! That's great! I understand about grammar and punctuation. I am improving my skill. Thank you teacher.
It's a good course that help to know verb tense and how to punctuate correctly Thank's for everyone who made this course
This is a good course for improving writing, specially parallel structure and sentence variety improves writing skills.
Great starting point for grammar and punctuation. The teachers point out essential information to understand the rules.
My suggestion is that the sentence structure section should be precedes section involves usage of semicolon and comma.
I think that the instructors should try to be more energetic and be on camera more for more face to face interaction.
Everything is excellente but you should check the complementary links that go up because sometimes they are disabled
The course is a well thought one .The material can be enhanced to accommodate more rules and usages into the course.
I really enjoy practicing with this course. It contains clear explanations and a good variety of practice exercises.
It's a very nice course if you want to correct your English grammar, and you want to punctuate sentences correctly.
It's very interesting course in easy wayBut it's better to get a pdf file containing the the material in the course
The course material and lectures were simple and understandable, but some practice materials do not work properly.
The Course is delivered very well. Also it helps learners to easily get what the exercises and lesson it delivers.
At the beginning it starts a little bit slow, but later on it speeds up and it becomes interesting and educative.
It is a good course to improve your skills ( Grammar and Punctuation). The way that the course use is brilliant.
Cleared the confussion for commas and semicolons.Great course for beginners who want to start exploring writing.
Basic but useful cause. I've learned something new that my Enlish teachers never mentioned back in the college.
It's not content many information, but it's useful, especially about the comma and semicolon usage. Thank you!
I like the explanation of the chapters. However, something else could be used instead or peer-to-peer review.
This served as a good reminder of the basics in English which are easily forgotten and overlooked. Thank you.
Not bad, but I want to more information about tense. i hope the tense course need to put lots of information.
It explains various grammar rules in a very clear and concise manner. Eager to learn more of English grammar.
It is good for people with intermediate people. have many tricks i never know before. i have enjoyed my time
I mostly feel satisify with this course, but actually speaking, it seems that we can add more content in it.
Course structure was really good. It would have been better if there would have been more practice problems.
I had a good experience with this course. It'll be even better if there can be a review plan for the course.
This was a great refresher course for basic grammar. I would love to take the next level up if there is one!
I'm still a little confused on some things, but otherwise great course! I really think I have learned a lot.
I like the course materials, but I think it will be great if there are more practice sentences and quizzes.
I didnt expect the understanding and learning, that I had when I started the course online. Thank you Team.
This course is a good review of what I have learnt before, and it clears out some confusions. Quite useful.
The explanation is simple, so that you can understand the rules of punctuation easily through this course.
This course is very comprehensive, especially if you want to learn where to put commas in your sentences!
The quiz sections was not that much easy, needed some terrible focusing and complete idea on the topics.
Content was very well structured and helpful. However, multiple external practice resources didn't work.
It's a good course, and it has a good structure to push student forward to improve their writing skills.
simple and effective tips on the writing, I have learnt few rules which i can use in my regular writing.
It's a really good course when you are trying to understand more of the grammar and improve your writing
It's a very good course. I suggest everyone to learn from this online course, it's very helpful for me.
Every thing was good ,but I wish if the English teacher corrected my assignment and gave me a feedback.
Very good! But I think it's more suitable for high school students, as the course's content is simple.
It was my first Coursera course. Exceeded my expectations with the way how the lessons were explained.
this is a very good course,
I was able to learn a lot about the sentence structure, and punctuations.
I really like to take this course, but I would have liked to do a reminder at the end of the course.
needs more example's and need to explained it morebut it's great course i know too much thank you <3
Very good course for the beginners,especially those who remind tenses and basic punctuation's rules.
Gives a good review of the most important parts of grammar and commas. I can recommend this course!
This was a really great course to start with, and I would definitely recommend this for beginners.
This course is very effective platform for achieving the skill of creative writing. thank you all.
should provide more practical exercise of writing, not exercise selecting which answer is correct.
It  be shocking what ain'ts leant good, however - and this is true but - this course helps, intit?
It was really helpful. Learned a lot from the course. Mostly, because of the way it was designed.
I wish it was more in-depth at times with some grammar that is slightly relevant with the course.
This was a very helpful One to understand the specific punctuation uses that are very important.
Its a good initiative course if you are looking up for enhancing your article writing abilities.
That was a wonderful experience. Learnt a lot from the course which I had not understood before.
Useful for improvement of grammar and punctuation.Helps in enhancing the skills and usage of it.
the course is pretty good, but the present of the teacher at the moment of corrections is needed
The course is useful especially for individuals who are trying to improve their writing skills.
I liked the practice part, it helped with understanding the videos and clearing any confusion.
The explanations are short and to the point. More practice test would be appreciated, however.
Some very useful points. Would recommend to anyone who struggles in understanding punctuation.
I am not happy with the final quiz because some answers I choose A and it came out showing B.
Great course! However, some of links didn't work (they were reffered to non-existant themes).
It is valuable course you will find the answers of many questions that you are searching for.
This course is fundamental and helps to understand how to constrac a sentence and paragraph.
Me parece que faltó un poco de retroalimentación por parte de algunas preguntas de los quiz
For me, the topics were short and easy, so I think you should add more items to the course.
I am happy after completing this course. This course has improved my punctuation knowledge.
I would thank the staff of the university for this useful courseand I appreciate your work.

Hi, Learn the basic of the English grammar and the rules on writing, which so important to writing.   Enjoyed and learn so much that will help overcome fear writing.   Thank You, AgainRobert Perea
A very useful course, specially designed for those who either forgot the grammar or  did not study English grammar properly in the journey of learning English. It is a  path way to good writing skills.
I am very satisfied with this course. It really helped me to improve my writing skills, and I am feeling more confident than I used to be.After this course, I am planning to take up the next one.
This course had an outstanding syllabus and i have learned a lot about punctuation rules and regulations  in English Language; which will excel my capabilities for my future endeavors and study plan.
This Grammar and Punctuation course should be taken by anyone who is interested in professional writings.
This course is absolutely amazing by all means. It has good and specific and accurate information regarding punctuation and grammar in English. The focus and the way the information is presented is excellent too. I have no negative comments for this course. Excellent! 5 stars.
The course is really great and helpful. I really appreciate everything the professors learnt.
The course did not review all basic English grammar but specify tense, sentence type and punctuation. At first, I thought I would have known how to write a appropriate sentence, but only after took this course I find various way to rewrite my sentence in a more correct and natural as native people. I realised some minor mistakes I have always made before and knew  how to fixed it. Now, when it come to writing I feel much more confident. Definitely, I recommend this courses for someone would like to review their grammar, and I will considering studying the next courses about Business writing in this program.
This course is a great little course. I loved the instructor, who I found to be articulate and engaging. I found the guidance on sentence structure and parallel sentences, constructive and beneficial. So, thanks!
A great couse filled with great examples.
i  like this course
I believe this course is simple and straight forward. The learning material is quite good and easy to comprehend. However, I found the topic relating to tenses a bit more confusing. I would request if more practice could be added to the existing list. Also, animating the course materials might add real beauty to the course. I would like to say thanks to all the course instructors, and I am grateful to the experienced faculties for introducing this short English course.
I will recommend every beginner level students, interested to improve their  Academic  English Writing skills, to take this course. There are many cooperative classmates who will review your assignments with constructive information and will help you improve. It helped me a lot and I have decided to enrol for the second course in this specialization.
A very intelligently designed, and exceptionally smart program to train learners on grammar and punctuation. I fully admit this course was far more useful than I had initially thought of it to be the kind of, and never in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would turn out to be this much professionally rich. I’m equipped with a masters degree in English, and have a very valuable experience in teaching high school level & college level students. I wanted to brush up my own academic writing skills so I could guide my students more effectively. I’m so happy I joined this course. I must appreciate the quality of the instructions I watched in videos lectures which all had excellent content and had easy-to-follow examples. Practice exercises before the quizzes and the quizzes themselves were all very smartly designed stuff. I truly believe it couldn’t have been any better. My heart goes out to admiring your efforts. In a nutshell, I had a more than wonderful experience. I now strongly intend to going for the next course. Thanks a million, indeed!    ndFr�
This grammar and punctuation course filled the gaps that I had on punctuation. The structure is very efficient and clear; it was easy to remember the rules and practice them. Though I was skeptical regarding the peer reviews, they proved to be a good instrument. I would like to see more participation of the instructors: for example, proofing the peer reviews. I understand that it would increase the cost of the course, though. In addition, I feel like we didn't learn all punctuation cases. I haven't seen anything about the colon or dash uses, not even mentioning the direct speech. However, in spite of said above, I would highly recommend the course to those who would like to know or revisit the punctuation basics. I will definitely look at the other courses by UCI Irvine
I've learned so much in such a small time in this Grammar and Punctuation course, that I'm still processing it in my mind! The videos and texts are concise and creative. It facilitated my understanding of the words, since English is not my first language. Through the exercises and extra resources, I practiced a lot. Here are some of the things that I studied: simple, compound and complex sentences; dependent and independent clauses; comma and semicolon; transition words and adverbial phrases; introductory and interrupting phrases; parallel sentences; variety of sentences. Thanks to the instructor Tami Chapman, she is the best!
What an amazing course, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to improve their writing skills. This course will not only enhance your written communication but also will boost your confidence. In order to do best in verbs, punctuation, and sentences, you can enroll in this course blindly.Subsequently, individuals have to complete the assignments, which are part of the curriculum, with full dedication, and they have to spend some time on a regular basis to get the best out of this course. I wish all the best to everyone for their future endeavors.PS-If any mistakes in the above sentences, please let me know.
this course has helped me a lot before joined this course I didn't know how to use comma but after this course, I can understand how to use conjugation.
This course was very helpful. It refreshed my memories and made me go back to so many things I thought I would never remember. It  helped my writing skills a lot to. A big thank you to the instructors.
I highly recommend this course. This paves the way to keep a note higher in my English skills  particularly in grammar and punctuation. What a remarkable experience ! You will definitely learn a lot .
This course is AMAZING! I learned subjects I had never heard of in other courses and today I can write essays with the correct grammar. I want to finish all the blocks of the course to become a writing expert. It was worth every minute dedicated to this course. There are excellent teachers and there are several examples and exercises to do you understand the subject discussed.
This was a great introductory or refresher course for English grammar and punctuation. As a native English-speaker, there are things I knew intuitively, but I did not understand the rules. This course increased my confidence as I am not able to identify verb tenses, use current punctuation in my sentences, and construct parallel sentences. It has improved my writing skills.
Absolutely brilliant. I really recommend this course if you need to brush up on your grammar and punctuation.  I didn't study grammar at school, (many years ago) as it wasn't in the curriculum, however, this is an informative and yet interesting way to learn.  The course provides you with videos, quizzes, and tests which help to embed the learning at your own pace.
Excellent course. However, I suggest having mentors to answer questions through the course in a forum because students are not able to answer all confusing points themselves. In addition, in the practice exercises, it is better to add an explanation to clarify why one result is right and why another one is wrong. Thank you. .
amazingly good
It is very helpful  to both  the teachers and the students as they  have been in the process of learning. The beauty lies in the style  of imparting which  is clear and lucid. It motivates the  teachers to adopt it readily. Similarly, it makes the learning of students easy. The course designers and instructors have indeed done a marvellous job. Today those who are in the  field  of teaching  should be innovators looking for creative ideas, new approaches and methods . Here I found in your course a scientific way of teaching supported by  great research . This course will really make a great difference in teachers and students. After this course, they will start  looking  at this language differently. When they use this language either in writing or in speech,  they will use comma and semi colon at proper places which makes thier more  sensible. My son suggested  these courses to me,  and  I got 100% in my second course. Thanks to coursera.
This course is meaningful for those people who are not native speakers, which can help them to review the details like the correct usage of commas. Thanks a lot for this course.At the same time, I think that it can be better if those Peer-graded Assignment and exams can be designed to be more ingenious. For example, correcting wrong sentences may be more effective than just writing some ones. In this way, teachers can use some typical examples and let students look for mistakes and correct them in a variety of ways. After that, peers can communicate in different ways and they may learn more about "Grammar and Punctuation". From my perspective, simply asking students to make a few different types of sentences does not help them understand the grammar better.
This course enables you to overcome a lot of minor and major grammatical errors which we usually do in our life. I am happy that I decided to take this course for revising my present knowledge of the English language and for learning something new such as Parallel Structure and Sentence Variety, as well. The contents and the study materials that have been provided in this course is very informative, brief, and simple so that anyone, who knows little bits of English, can easily understand it.Thank you for creating such an informational and worthy contents here!
The course help me under standing review helps with writing skill. I am a noob in this web site and this course too. I hope in the future that I master writing as well with the English grammar. My communication required grammar so the listener would understand me saying. Writing is more different than talking because you can see what you wrote. Right now my first lesson is introducing and review other which I don't know the finishing line. Probably two hour long. This course would teach you punctuation and maybe all writing skill to be a writer.
I enjoyed this course very much. Going into this course, my goal was to review English grammar and improve my writing. After finishing it, I feel like I accomplished that goal. I enjoyed concise and clear style of the videos and clarity of examples given in them. Assignments and exercises, although challenging at times, were of comfortable length and fun to do. Personally, this course helped me to become aware of the sentences I write, and gave me the tools to revise and edit my writings more efficiently on my own.
For me, this training
course has clarified that how to use correct verb tenses, correct punctuation,
good parallel structure, and good sentence variety ,better than before. Really participated in this session makes significant impact in my writing skills. In addition,
driven by an awesome constriction of the lesson modules  and excellent explanation of
the instructor, I have became very passionate to enrolling in any advance classes. thank you very much for making education available for people across the world.
This course was wonderful. 
I learned new things about grammar and punctuation I don't recall
learning in grade school while blending and improving my known knowledge. A tip
for those thinking of just enrolling in one or two random courses of the five specialized
courses, enroll in all.  It is worth it
even if you think you know. For instance, some of the papers in Advance Writing
expect you to know some of the previous courses info and that could lead to
some misunderstandings or struggles on quiz/peer reviews.
I really enjoyed this course! It was a lovely, concise, quick summary of the skills I wanted to get up to speed on. I already knew grammar rules intuitively but needed to revisit how to formulate and provide rationales for my choices, particularly when I work with students. This course fit the bill entirely. It also helped me to tweak some things that had fallen into disrepair. I'm looking forward to the next course in your series on academic writing. Thank you for the excellent instruction and format.
I would Like to say that this course has been amazing. I have learned things that I thought I knew but I did not actually know. I have learned a lot about all different kinds of sentences and how many there are. I learned about punctuation. I was able to properly teach my kids how to do their writing and what they are doing wrong. I still need to work on these skills some more. But without this class I would not have gained the knowledge that I know now. Thank you very much. this was amazing!!
First of all, I am very thankful to the Coursera team and the University of Colombia that they give me financial aid. Due to the financial aid that I received from the Coursera, I was able to learn a new skill that I wanted to learn for so long. This course is quite good and I learned many new things in this course. I requested to the Team Coursera and the University of Colombia that they give me aid for their next course so that I can learn the new skill fully.
With instructors delineated; easy to understand and well-designed lectures and numerous learning resources, from the very beginning till the end of the course I was able to learn a lot of things; moreover, I interacted with a very active and curious peer group, sometimes they corrected my errors and sometimes I did the same for them. looking forward to learning new things from this engaging website and to implement them in my life. Lastly thank you, Coursera.
This course is beneficial for a person who wants to write well or to pursue career in writing. The teacher is very good. The course is very informative and productive. She prepared the course very well. Assignments and exercises will help you to learn things easily.  Each and every second of lecture is worth to listen and they are very precise also. The professor has provided useful material which you can read later. I'm so glad that I took this course.
In this course, I've learnt many things, which will be very useful, if not essential, when I'll have to do the writing part in my exams. Learning how to punctuate correctly is the key to succeed in the accademic world, so it worth the effort doing this course; besides, it isn't so long, so you can easily go through it and, therefore, learn at you leisure. In conclusion, I would recommend it, and you can take this review as an example of its usefulness.
It was a wonderful course. I not only enjoyed the course but also learned a lot. There are a few suggestions I would like to make:1. Instead of using green or red color for correct or incorrect, please design tick for correct and cross for incorrect.2. Quizzes don't have any explanation for their answers. I would be very beneficial for students if the correct version of the answers is also provided, which will help to clarify any misconception.
This course was sweet and sour for me. It was sour, because, after each lesson, I came to know how shallow my skills were in English. On the other hand, it was sweet, as it guided me to overcome my mistakes in a non-intimidating way. Sometime I felt like, this course understands me very well. The lessons were well organized. And, there were additional materials after each lesson; they were instrumental for learning.
This course was really awesome. This course cleared my lots of confusions like how to join sentences and that would be helpful for me in my academic life. But it creates lots of confusions that generates interest to take another course. The teaching style and presentations of Instructors of this course are really awesome. I enjoyed the course very much. Thanks to my lovely instructors and Coursera for this course.
Most of the people for whom English is secondary language and are working in academia, writing a standard article whether it's a research article or usual report is a tough job. This course which is a part of a specialization course: Academic English writing starts at a very sweet introductory topic punctuation. Believe me, after attending this course you will surely see the drastic changes in your writing style.
it was very interesting course, I learn ,briefly , the verb tenses and some comparative  between the similar ones. Also I learned how to form a compound and complex sentences by adding conjunctions and transitions. Finally, I learned about how to make the parallel sentences when we use the conjunction and transitions; In addition, I learned how to variate my sentences to avoid repetition and write good essays.
This Course has been really Amazing. I enjoyed it and I learnt something new and as for the Grammer section, there were things that I've forgotten but that I've been thought. but as a result of taking these classes it has rekindled in my spirit and has even given me a deeper understanding. Thank You, Coursera for this Great Opportunity to learn on your platform. I really appreciate it.Respect!!!
Thank you for all the information in this course. This is the first time that I clearly understand what is compound sentence and how to use comma. Even though I am still not perfectly flexible in controlling my sentence, I believe I have already improved a lot than my past.  At the same time, reviewing peers' work is an extremely helpful way to test what I learnt and help to strengthen my study.
The course was fantastic. Even though it seems simple and clear, but it includes all the essential elements in writing which I always have not paid too much attention to that. A perfect review on verb tenses, different types of all conjunctions, correct uses of punctuation, and a variety of sentence structures make the course unique and useful for everybody who wants to start academic writing.
i would have liked to have received feedback not only from the other students but also from the teachers , but in my opinion the explanations were clear, the activities were easy to comprehend, and the comments i was able to make on the classmates works helped me to understand better what i was doing, and not just because the way i was writing felt right. overall it was a good experience
This course was very helpful and beneficial. I've required a lot of important skills and knowledge that can help me produce correct and effective writings. I strongly recommend this course for anyone who'd like to improve their writing skills. In addition, I found the practice exercises were very related to the course material and very helpful to clarify what you've learned. Thank you.
I have learned English for a while, but the learning process was not systmatical, and the courses was not taught by native speakers. By learning this course from Coursera, I knew both how to use comma and how to puncuate the sentence.  Besides, my classmates were very friendly since they review my practices very patiently.
I like this course, BIG thanks for teachers and classmates.
This is an amazing course and I am going to take the next one in the same specialization. Through this course, I have learned four types of sentences, which helps us to have more varieties of paragraphs. Also, I have learned parallel structure and, basically, the formal use of punctuation. I believe that it is a lovely start and I will do better in my writing. Thanks a lot!
Excellent course! This really helped me professionally since I teach business English globally online to professionals and managers with multinational corporations. This course was a major asset for my professional development regimen, along with the other UC Irvine related course. Videos, quizzes and exercises are interactive and ideal for learning! Thank you!
It may sound ridiculous, but it is reaaly difficult in Russia to find out about English punctuation, so this course was very useful for me as a teacher. It allows me not only to improve my writing but also to develop my professional skills. I hope, it will help me to teach my students better.Thaks a lot for this course and specialization!All the best,Anastasia

This course teach us many grammar rules which we haven't learned ever. One of those rules is punctuation. After completing this course, you will be able to not only write English sentences better but also understand documents written in English easily. This course is definitely useful for everyone who know the grammar well but cannot write sentences well.
This is an excellent refresher course to brush up on grammar and punctuation. Prior to taking this course, I was an overzealous user of commas. Now, I know when to use certain punctuation and how to explain it to others. I definitely recommend this course for anyone wanting to revise English grammar and punctuation for the purpose of teaching or tutoring.
Without a doubt, It is an excellent course. Although I have done several courses on different platforms, I didn't learn enough about writing skills. Luckily, I found this course on Coursera, which is help me a lot to improve my writing skills. I am very happy to learn from this course, and I really thankful to the instructor. She is a fantastic teacher.

So, I've decided to take some classes to fill my blank spots in grammar and punctuation, and I couldn't find better way to do it. I highly recommend this course to everyone who has any problems with the understanding way the punctuation works. Thank you, Coursera!
I strongly recommend this basic course to everyone who wants to improve his/her writing skills in English. The course content is beautifully and easily designed that will motivate you to move forward through the course. Therefore, I was able to complete this course one week before its scheduled time. Thanks to Coursera and thanks to the course makers.
The course was very helpful. At first, I was skeptical on what I could learn from it since, in general, I feel confident with my English level, and the program seemed rather simple. However, upon completion of the course, I believe I've learned quite a few things on how to structure my writing in a correct way, which in turns makes it more efficient.
This course is engaging, fun, and very informative.  I would suggest everyone should take it even if English is your native tongue. It will help you understand how and why our sentences are structure and deeper understand of the language.  I am thoroughly enjoying this course.  I really enjoy interacting with the other students that is most fun!
Firs of all, I have to thank coursera for get this practicing. It was smooth and flexible with my work and time. Another cause of this high rate, is the way of lectures presentation which they are given simply. Coursera helped me not only have new tips, but also order my adeas and study plans.

I enrolled in this course to fine tune my writing skills for work. I enjoyed this course because I was able to unlearn some bad habits and simple mistakes. The lessons are simple and move at an even pace. If you are a native English Speaker, some of the lessons will be easy for you. In my personal opinion, this course was a great refresher.
Excellent course. Very complete and clear explanations. I believe that you should have a very high level of English and know certain rules as regards punctuation precisely. Otherwise, it can be very challenging. Still, if you are passionate about the English language, I would say it is one of the best courses to polish your writing skills.

I am Brazilian, and I have been studying English since 2011 as a second language. So far, I have not found I course like Grammar and Punctuation. What makes the difference is that it explains the content in a simple way so that students can learn easily. Besides, I learned things on the lecture videos that I had not learned until then.
Actually, It's difficult  for me to finish even one course in Coursera because I'm lock of good quality of persistence of doing something. By the way, I am so happy and grateful for my accomplishment and insistence, and I am so proud and cherish for I could have a such opportunity to take this lessen . Thanks all of you teachers here.

I loved this course because it was very thorough, and took a very complicated and confusing subject and made it easy to learn.  I thought I was a champ at grammar and punctuation, but I soon realized that there were more options and rules that I did not know.  The examples given were really good to use as reference in the future.

Thank you for all your effort in making this course possible.I look forward to taking some of other courses in the same specialization. Thank you again!

En este curso aprendí a formular enunciados más complejos de forma correcta y a usar las puntuaciones mejor. Es fluido y bastante entendible, lo recomiendo ampliamente.
There were couple of things I was always confused during the sentence making. After this course, I was able to use interrupting phrase, transition words, parallel structure, and sentence variety much better.

This is the best course I have ever learned before, so I would like to learn more courses. It is heaven for a student like me, who lives in a far place, and where is not a good English environment. For my side, I advise you to add more examples in the video lecture, and I have found some exercises not opened correctly.
I give 5 stars to this course because the materials of this course are very basic but very important, Such as Verb tense and Punctuation which I did not full understand in the past. But now, after finishing this course, I am more confidant about my writing. Thanks to the teacher and my classmates, you help me a lot !!
As a college level academic English teacher, I've learned quite a lot from Tamy's lessons. Tamy's instructions are very clear, systematic, and effective. This course can be a very valuable supplementary resource for EAP students' self-study. I will definitely recommend this course to my students. Thank you very much.

This course has helped me explore the techniques and areas which shall always remain useful to me.
This is a very comprehensive and useful course. Since this is a beginners course, the difficulty levels have been maintained accordingly.

This is the first course that I have finished in Coursera, and I am very impressed at the way you made this course engaging. I never felt boring and the exercises never got too challenging to lose interest. I wish all of the exercises were graded. But the ones that opened in a new window were good but not graded.

This topic was mostly ignored during my studies previously, so now thanks to this course I feel much more confident in my writing skills. I really hope now I will be able to pass my IELTS Writing with a high score.
Es muy bueno. Empieza con lo elemental, lo cual me parece que es el mejor inicio para el tema. Prosigue claramente con las explicaciones sobre el uso correcto de la coma y el punto y coma, y finalmente brinda una orientación eficaz sobre la estructuración correcta de nuestras creaciones narrativas en inglés.

Even though I took similar classes back in school, this course is the most effective one by far. I feel more confident to continue taking advanced writing course; moreover, writing seems less stressful.
This is a really great course. It takes you, to dig a little bit more into the, English Grammar & Punctuation concepts,  which many of us learned in the school level. The Quizzes are really interesting and require a lot of your focus & memory, thus they are lot of fun. Great course,enjoyed it, thorough! :)
That was an excellent course. Though I had learnt my grammar while in school, I had never learnt how to use it properly. I just went by the feel and made my sentences based on whether they sounded right or not. This course gave me insight on what was actually happening while writing a sentence. Thank you.
To be honest, this was the very first course I have accomplished on Coursera.This was simply amazing! I express my utter thankfulness to the Almighty, the instructors, my university and Coursera.Give it  a try, you won't regret. Have learnt several things which I was confused about.Thank you very much.

This is a very good course to revise one's knowledge on grammar and punctuation. it covers significant portions of grammar and punctuation in a simple way with lots of examples. Even if one knows the language, this course helps in going through grammar to recollect what all learned earlier.
I am so thankful to the coursera for offering this course. Especially, I am indebted to the coursera, because they helped me by sanctioning  financial aid. I learned several fundamental aspects in this course, like about tenses, proper punctuation, and about usage of parallel structure etc.
The course is very well designed with practices and quiz for the learners to check their knowledge. The forum also offers a very good platform for us as students to discuss about out confusions and share and evaluate some of our learning results. I benefited quite much from the course.
It was simply Brilliant. Every video lecture was not only easily understandable but also entertaining because of examples; however, there was some technical issues in practice exercises because they needed heavy internet to run, but at the end it was so far best online course for me.
I am really grateful to the Coursera team. without your financial aid, it was not possible for me to complete this fruitful course. I will prefer my folks and friends to do this course. thank you for this wonderful course. hope, I can confidently write my English without hesitation.
I haven't purchased the course itself, but as a free course to learn grammar and punctuation, it is great. It is the best of its kind. Though it was not as extensive as I would have liked, it covers all the essential grammar rules that anyone needs to get started with essay writing.
I loved this course an the instructor. I got my confidence back on my grammar and punctuation, however, need more practice to reach the perfection of my writing. The flexibility to take the courses for free of charge is very much appreciated. Thank you Tamy and UCI for your effort!
This is really helpful course. If you have already some knowledge on grammar and punctuation, but you are not sure about it yourself, you should take this course. You will have more confidence when you write in English.

The course notes and videos are concise. They are extremely helpful in setting fundamental skills besides correcting misconceptions I had about punctuation and usage of commons in writing before. Thank you very much for the efforts the coordinator and the team had made thus far.
Hi, everyone. This is the best course I ever read in my life because it has the best contents with the best instructors. I am thankful to UCI and Coursera team for providing such a great opportunity. A special thanks to Maam Tamy Chapman for making the most difficult parts easy.
Starting with the training of basic and important grammar and punctuation knowledge, this course literally make us prepared for the following essay-writing courses. The professor elaborate every and each grammar through numberous examples, which is more than easy to understand.
Even if you are fluent a review is always helpful to remind you why things are done a certain way.  If you are not rusty, it should take you no time to finish.  But if you are rusty in some area, and just don't realize it, this will point to where the problem may be and fix it.
I enjoyed this course, as it gradually leads you through the core issues of the grammar and punctuation. Every subject of the course is clearly explained, and, what I personally appreciate, there is enough guided practice to check on the understanding of the matter. Thank you!
Not only was this course extremely helpful, it was also quite enjoyable.  The lectures are well structured, the quizzes fair, and the peer assignments fun. So, if you think you could use either an introduction or a refresher, go ahead and take the course. You won't regret it!
Thanks university of California for this course. I had learned much stuff about Grammar and Punctuation rules, and different types of sentences in English. This course helps me to correct my mistakes about tenses. Now it’s time to dive into the next course. Highly recommend.
This course was really helpful and did refresh my rusty grammar. The lectures were ordered so perfectly that most of the learning process was passive. I assuredly suggest taking this course because it is a perfect blend of simplicity, conciseness, concinnity, and usefulness.
I loved this course! All the videos and exercises are clear and understandable! I learned more than I was expecting. I had to take a grammar class at my college last year and this course taught me more than that class at the college. I am really grateful for this material.
I really loved this course! It's not difficult and the lessons effectively refreshed what I have learned back in grade school. The modules aren't boring and I was so into it that I finished everything (from week 1 to week 4) in just one day. Thank you for this experience!
Amazing! Can't believe that an online course could offer such detailed lectures and progress tracking experience. I put in everything and earned my first certificate on Coursera within three days. Thanks to the lock down and the friendly learning environment offered here.
I loved this course for its simplicity, precision, style of teaching and the variety of practice questions plus quizzes. It kept me on my toes, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is ideal for anyone wanting to learn basic English Grammar or anyone needing a quick refresher.
Really worth giving course! I was not so confident about benefits of this course but ,at the end of the course, i have learnt many rules of punctuations and tenses and parallelism of clauses. I recommend all participants of coursera to join this course. Happy learning.
If you are interested in making essays, it will be the best course you´d ever take. It has the main rules of writing. By the way, the better English level you have, the more advantage you will get for it. So it is better if you maybe have an intermediate level or more.
Loved the course.  It enlighten me on both grammar and punctuation that was not conveyed clearly at school as a student growing up.  I love the English language and would love to write a book someday.  I am happy to gain this knowledge through this course.  Keep it up.
