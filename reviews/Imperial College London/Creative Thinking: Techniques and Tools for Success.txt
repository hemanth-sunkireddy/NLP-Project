The course does not update properly... so many people are not getting the certificates that they pay for .... Including myself. . . I completed all the work, the peer reviews, the peers reviewing my work... Yet no certificate. . . The material on the course is quite good however, AUDIT .... DO NOT PAY FOR THIS COURSE     I had tried to contact Coursera many times to no avail !!!      Very disappointing to what could be a really good course with good material. . .
I am not happy with the structure of this course. I tried a couple of times to send a comment after every discussion round. However, the system doesn`t send my text and didn`t complete these stages. I am very dissatisfied with this result.
I completed this course in one afternoon. No reason for it to be seven weeks long. A few useful concepts are presented here, but rather than prompting you to use them yourself (except for 2 exceptions), you get to watch a video of engineering students using the concept. Detailing and practicing how to use specific tools would have been infinitely more useful than watching others do it.
Not a course but more of a series of vague presentation videos suited for blogs or YouTube. I am shocked of the lack of quality in this course from the Imperial College London. I would not spend money on it.
It is more like a series of blog posts, but not a couse. Take it if it is free, but don't buy it. The most useful part if the videos with technic example with students.
The teaching material is fine, though I found it a bit inconsistent (explanation on some topics are a bit basic). The online experience itself is appalling, with so many bugs and poor explanations that I was put off from many tasks. Pages were you are asked to upload or download files that have no download or upload buttons,  logging in and continuing from where your left is challenging as the systems opens any random section for that week with no logic, forums (not mandatory) are full of pointless 2 words postings that do not follow prompts, it is impossible to go back to your own forum postings to check if anyone replied or commented, hardly any details on file formats you are supposed to upload or download, explanations on some mandatory tests are so poorly written that I wondered what was I supposed to submit. This feels like a cheap course shabbily put together just to make money out of the Imperial College London 'brand'.
There is not much content, professor is somehow annoying and people in the videos realy looks like they were forced to do this. Overall my impression in very low.
I didn't personally like the course, it provides different ways to organise thoughts,but the examples were uninspiring.
Choice in assignments would have been better!
its was very long more than it should be
Material not challenging enough
Sadly this course wasn't for me. The tools and techniques covered are not ones that would be necessarily useful or feasible to use on a daily basis in my career and I felt that these techniques would be more suited to a teacher or university lecturer who needs techniques to get the class involved in creative thinking.
The video production quality was great. The course was too stretched out for simple concepts and tools. There were also far too many discussion prompts, something almost no one participates in. Loved a few of the tools, hated a few others. Overall, I had a decent experience.
A lot of the videos and articles were shared as links. I wish they were directly embedded in the course itself, making them easier to download and view whenever we could. Apart from that, the content was great and a fair mix of theory as well as practical applications.
Interesting, enjoyable, I could recommend to provide material to follow the subjects. I think the second part of the course is more complicated to understand or apply, including how to use TRIZ, SCARSE, Morphological system.overall I will recommend it.
Learnt New ThingsBut the course could have been shorterAnd the application examples could have been easierOverall good course.
Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I have to withdraw from the course, may I know how to do it?
Videos are very less. Only readings. It would be better if the videos were more elaborate
The course is nice just that I couldn't get my certificate
Course is good. I couldnt find the free certificate link
Good !But teacher speed on some subjects was fast.
Some good parts, some very fiddly annoying parts.
i have learnt so many thinks in this course
Let's have PDFs we should work on, to Doc.
It’s good to take extra knowledge
The course gave some good techniques for creativity and problem solving. Most of it is for groups and require time but will yield good results. The assignments do ensure you put in your brains something that I haven't seen on many other moocs. Overall a good course, maybe they can involve tools that are quick to yield results and easy to implement.
well designed and useful course.Conducted effectively,organised scientifically.
Really creatively thought provoking course, well worth doing!
Excellent guide to the introduction of creative thinking. Specially the 6 hats, Morphological charts and TRIZ are well explained.
Very insightful and overall great. What I did not like was the huge amount of typos that even occurred in assessments which resulted in wrong answers. Reviewing documents submitted from the course creators would have definitely helped.
This course offers a glimpse into the tools available for creative thinking. I believe it provides a good basis for usage of the tools and also points you to areas that may be of further interest. The assignments are combination of weekly exercises, readings, quizzes and projects. It also showcase how the different tools are applied in practice which is great help to understand how to start using them. The course could be further improved by adjusting some of the weekly exercises as some involve drawing and it may be difficult for people outside of the art space to complete them. Other than that highly recommended course!
While the content is generally good, there were some technical issues where it was not possible to upload assignments in the requested format. I have already written in to Coursera separately regarding this.Also, there needs to be a more robust control or regulation system when it comes to graded assignments - as during peer grading, I encountered several incomplete assignments - or with no content at all. As a leader in the field, Coursera should consider the impact this has on the overall credibility of online learning.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It teaches several creativity tools and brainstorming formats that are applicable to group settings. I think this course is ideal for anybody looking to tackle problems in a  different way and thinking of taking a more leadership-oriented role while working in a team.However (I am not certain if all other courses in Coursera work like this) I have not been able to contact the teacher, nor appear to be able to ask any questions to the instructor or moderators.
Very interesting course, expanded my curiosity on the subject and the desire to learn further. I discovered technics I had never heard of before (Six Hats, TRIZ). My only frustration was the streaming with videos (possibly because I am in China) and the access to the B-Link site (not able to connect thus far.I definitely recommend the course. A big thank you to Professor Child for setting it up and making the knowledge accessible.
The course overall is very interesting. For me the most interesting are the tools that are shown. Though sometimes along the lessons the subjects can be not that "hooky". And also some text and exercises are written as giving for granted that you already know certain information that is not included in the course. This certainly could be improved. As well a couple of the exercises that also do not work could be fixed.Overall 9/10
Regardless you are working adult or student from any discipline, creative thinking is one of the most important skills to help us propel further. Peter has summarized wonderful list of techniques and shared with us through this course. Contents are superb and it also requires us to keep on practicing until we can perfect technique. Thanks a lot, Peter and the team.
An Excellent course wherein the principles and methods can be used in any domain. As I am in teaching, the creative tools can help me teach the concepts of any subjects at ease and this could help my students learn the subjects without any difficulty. I like to explore more concepts and try to learn and use the same in my teaching.
It was a really great experience to learn about the different approaches for the creative process of generating new ideas and look for solutions to everyday problems, and also for more specialized subjects. Definitely a must take course for anybody who is studying or working at any branch of engineering or sciences.
A very great course as I received lots of information and lots of useful strategies .My head is ready to burst, but in a good way! This new tools and skills  will help me implement a new way of creativity  thinking for my career! Thanks Peter Child and Coursera Team for this amazing learning experience!Cheers
I really enjoyed the content and activities.  Unfortunately a link to Blink did not work and probably outdated.  That seems to be the case with some of the content as well.  It would be good to update some of the case studies and articles. Thanks for offering this for free during a difficult time.
The course is very relevant to almost all disciplines, especially to Engineers who deal with challenges at every moment daily. The best part of the course is practical Quizzes/Assignments/Puzzles. Thanks a lot to the instructor (Prof. Peter Childs) for designing the course.
Before this course, I thought I was creative. During this course I found new ways and tools to improve creative thinking. After this course I know better what "thinking creative" means  and I think I could become more creative. Thanks for everything, Peter and Co  !
Good course! I only give it 4 stars because some videos are listed as texts and, in this case, it doesn't offer subtitles either transcription. It affected some of my notes. I think that it can affect the experience of some people who aren't fluent in English.
It a was a good and interesting course. The only thing I missed was more opportunities or help (maybe more this second) to practise the tools you learn. Of course is a online course and this is more difficult to achieve, but I think more things could be done.
I enjoyed this course a lot. All the videos are really relatable and amazing along with every assignments. I learned lots of things from it which can make my life easy and help me to think in a creative way.                                  Thankyou!!!
Overall the course is interesting though there were some links which are impossible to open, the tasks were mostly connected with technical and eco areas and this is no my area of interest. Great tool and I will use them in the future for sure :)
The course was worth my time and I am glad that I was able to learn about new ways of coming up with ideas. In addition, problem solving doesn't look like a big deal anymore with the several techniques that was taught in the course.
Excellent videos and application activities. However, some forum discussions for certain weeks are lacking an 'add image' function. In addition, B-link doesn't seem to be working. Overall, the course is still worth a try.
The course was good. I felt like there's no much attention to the course because of some typos I found and outdated content regarding the B-link software. I learn a lot and I would recommend this course to some friends.
I loved doing this course. It made me work, think, apply knowledge and helped me in bringing out my creative side. I would like to thank Sir Peter Childs for providing us with such an enriching experience. Thank You.
This has really helped me channelize my creativity to solve daily life problems (not just related to work but otherwise). These skills are very handy if you are involved in projects professionally and personally.
Really interesting course with applications in all fields. It was much more work than I anticipated, but really thought provoking. I underestimated the power of (and thought/work needed for) creative thinking!
During COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging students and people who are currently unemployed, is highly appreciated. The course, helped me understand so much in a very theoretical as well as in a practical way.
the course could have had detailed explanations on the methods shown. The assignments are tougher to upload as there aren't any directions given. Apart from these two short comings the course is brilliant
Interesting course. I knew half of the methods explained in this course as I have used them in college. The other ones were knew to me and quite interesting. It is clear and doesn't take too much time.
Very interesting course! I especially liked the different e-tivities that allowed me to put the theory into practice. Great tools to stimulate thinking, association and creativity. Recommended!
I really enjoyed and learnt many new techniques and tools with examples and assignment. I would love to apply these techniques in my personal and professional life. Thank you so much.
The course material was good and I'm equipped some good creative thinking techniques. I would have liked if it was geared more towards individual creative thinking than group.
Very detail and wide perspective. Definitely, worth 5 stars but only able to give 4 because certain surveys must be done via a PC or laptop. Other than that, it is good.
i really enjoy the course i'm sure i will use de tools in my carrer, i think it would be fine if you develop a little more the SCAMPER tool. Thanks for the opportunity
I have learned through coursera so many skill techniques also I learned lots of knowledgable thinksThank you so much for guid me for new skills and techniques
This course is really mind-blowing. Course will give a way to your thinking. When you follow the path you will automatically lead towards creative solution.
In general the course is great but maybe the last part, one with webinars, should be optional as they are quite long. In general, I really liked it.
Very good course, useful techniques and very well produced with short videos. Examples and role-plays could have been better in most instances.
It was a great experience to complete this course.I am thankful to Dr. Peter and the university for providing such a great course.THANK YOU 😊
The topics are interesting but the lectures were very boring that I feel like I am enrolling in a course that needs creativity in teaching.
Great course! it gives many tool to think about certain things differently. I enjoyed all the quizzes and assignments while learning!
nice course and awesome tools used to teach creativity, daily life problem solution topic should also be included rest all is fine
Amazing resource, with a massive amount of content delivered in a variety of formats (videos, downloads, examples), and all free!
Good education material and explanation, but for me not enough additional information like books, articles, etc. So only 4 stars
Loved the activities and discussions and the videos where the students were practically using these creativity tools.
It was a very good experience for me overall. I have learnt a lot of new concepts that can be used in any domain.
Giving me an insight on how to get new ideas to solve some of the problem. Different way to generate new ideas.
Everything interesting and stimulating but, unfortunately, the link to b-link platform not worked. So sad! :(
Useful and practical techniques. Wasn't really what I expected, but I will apply the knowledge anyways.
Awesome course! It is informative and engaging! I am looking forward to future additions of materials.
I am so happy to finish this course, it was exciting to me to learn new ideas from this course.Thanks
I enjoyed the course very much and feel that assignments is different and very good I feel enjoyable
such a wonderful course that provides important tools for the develop of ideas at any environment
This course is very useful because this gives me success points and ideas and much thing.
Excellent course! I  loved it. Looking forward to make the world better by being creative
Some examples can be more generic instead of being technical for a better understanding.
Presented tools are great. But 'mind maps' or 'lateral thinking' would be nice to have.
Very precise knowledge.my most favorite part is the definition of creativity!
Nice course providing interesting insight into the area of problem solving.
Good materials.  I really appreciate the work and the information provided.
Good course. Maybe a bit short but the material covered is well covered.
This is a very interesting course that will surely help me in my work.
A great course very well taught and a great instructor to learn from .
a fun and informative course on creativity tools and how to use them
A must do course to learn different kinds of tools to solve problems
Es un curso muy bueno y muy atendible me gusto mucho lo recomiendo
Good, you just clearly need to learn the tools that's it !!!
A good course with much needed tools for our daily lives.

a very nice course
Foi um bom curso
Learnedabunch
good not bad
well
This was my first online course and I loved it. It was very detailed, crisp and clear. Would recommend this to my friends. Thanks, Peter and Team, and Imperial College.
The course takes 7 weeks but I finished it in 3 full days over the easter weekend. It starts out easy then slowly increases in difficulty, challenging your critical thinking and understanding of the topics in a practical way that you can use them in real life. Video lectures were interesting and succinct (never more than 5 min long). I especially like the videos showing practical application by students as it gives you a good idea on how the creative techniques can be applied in real life. These videos are shot from a viewpoint of you sitting among the students so you feel like you are attending a class. The additional readings were never unnecessarily long (no more than 3 pages), but carefully chosen as they are packed with important information that will improve your understanding of the subject.  The online tests, e-activities and peer assignments are very helpful for you to master the techniques taught, if you do it seriously you will really see yourself grow. Discussion board sessions were less helpful due to students at different timezones which meant when you type a comment, you don't necessarily get a reply. However it is still helpful to read through comments by other students to get different perspective, although quality comments aren't many due to this section being optional so many students pass up the chance to give any comment at all. Overall I found the course very fulfilling and I will definitely use the knowledge and techniques at my personal and professional life. I highly recommend this to people from all specialisation background.
An extremely knowledgable course. It helped me learn some creative thinking tools which I can apply in my personal and professional life. If you think one course will make you an expert at creative thinking - not true. Practice is required!
This course has pushed me to think beyond the normal and finding ways to solve any problem ina much more creative manner.Thank you..
Very practical approach to an usually overlooked subject in STEM courses. Highly advised for all students, essential for engineering ones
One of the best courses I came across on Coursera, the content provided in the course top-notch. And the way, methods, principles taught will benefit me throughout my life. It will definitely help me in thinking about solutions to the problems I encounter in a very different way, which would ultimately increase my efficiency.
I would like to thanj you for yhe interesting details given to explain creativity. Kindly, may I  ask for a free certificate. Thank you.Sincerely, Hana Abou Hassanein
An excellent course for a systematic exposure of some interesting and widely used creativity tools! Thanks for increasing the awareness and confidence to use them in professional and personal domains!
This course was really amazing. I enjoyed a lot and learned as well! This course helped me to enhance my creativity.... Thanks to Prof. Peter for his amazing lectures with illustrated examples!
An excellent course which got me to think on many different plains, specially when using the tools on issues and topics that I didn't think needed creative thinking skills. Would recommend it.
Very nice course! I have learnt a lot and that allowed me now to see the
big picture about creativity.  I become
now more enthusiast to learn more about creativity and apply it in both my professional
and personal life. What an inspiring course!I wish to extend a huge thank you  to Professor Peter Childs and his team.
Amazing Course. Thank you coursera.org for this course and thanks to Imperial College London for delivering such an amazing course.
helpful course and gave me many ideas.
Very good course and the professor
I'd like to thank Mr. Peter and his team for this informative, valuable, and interesting course. I believe the course will be a true worthy of money. I suggest others to take this course if someone really want to learn about creativity and its techniques.
I enjoyed this course right from the start. The videos are relatable and exciting as so were the reading exercises to get a better knowledge of how to think and easy, fast steps to get to those ideas.
Really enjoyed this.  I've completed some Creativity courses before, however I learnt lots of new tools and techniques that I will actually be able to use both at home and at work.  Thank you.
Had lots of fun doing this course.Learnt a lot of techniques regarding brainstorming ,TRIZ,Six hats(my favourite) and morphological analysis.I hope I could apply this knowledge in my field.
Wonderful Course. Fantastically designed and smartly executed. Loved the whole concept of activities and engagement through various means. Enriched very nicely with good knowledge. Thanks!!
The course was fun! And I learnt a plethora of techniques that have immediate real-world application to all types of challenges I encounter in my everyday and professional life.
Prof. Childs is a great Instructor and teacher. He will explore you to different creative exercises and will help you to come up with your own creative solutions to problems.
If you would like to nourish the sleeping "creative thinker" in you, this is highly recommended. Don't take my word for it, take this course to believe.
Quite interesting course, I've learned new techniques I wasn't aware of. The number of practical exercises with peer review gradings might be increased
U people do a lot of effort and time really what can I say Thank You together will make the world progress and living
Creative thinking is very great skill to learn any thing in simple way.
Great Course for Creative Thinking: Techniques and Tools for Sucess
I loved the course. It clearly made me learn how to think.
I loved the course and assignments. They are very useful.
Really informative. Ideal for people of all ages.
it was a good cource  its really healped me
very applicable in real life
Great course that opened my eyes on the tools/techniques that will help me further in my career on a higher level and solve problems efficiently and be creative to find out more paths of solutions.Professor Peter Child has presented the knowledge in a very clear and systematic way, which encouraged the motivation of learning and stop the boreness before it happened.  There are a fair amount of combination of videos, readings, quizzes and forum to show everyone's work.  I have done another online course from another institution at the same time in the similar topic.  This course is way better structured and enable students to learn in an interesting but rememberable way.  And also they do follow up webinar as well to up catching the reality with the skills in the course.Thanks for all the effort to the team involve in this course :) I'm very impressed and appreciated.
El curso es bastante interesante, creo que hay algunas técnicas que no deberían aplicarse porque son muy específicas a las ingenierías, como TRIZ, en vez de eso hubiera sido genial abordar el pensamiento lateral. Sin embargo, creo que valió mucha la pena y agradezco al profesor por su valiosa contribución a mi aprendizaje. Bendiciones y saludos desde Colombia.The course is so interesting. I think there are some techniques that must not be applied because are so specific to engineer fields (like TRIZ). In contrast, it would have been amazing to learn something about lateral thinking. Nonetheless  I think the course is totally worth, I appreciate the teacher contributions in my learning. blessings and greetings from Colombia.
I consider myself as a beginner in this kind of things, like problem solving or planning. i found this course specifically, veryy useful to learn how to solve problems in a creative way, generating useful ideas without relying on istinct alone but using specific methods.  The videos are somethimes a bit lengthy but if the argument is somewhat hard to explain in few words or without specific examples, in my humble opinion I fund it really useful having someone explaining me well instead to have to search myself to better clarify a specific subject.Why should you take this couse then? I learned I can use this principles in everyday's life too!
This mooc was really excellent. The quality of the course was really great, everything was really interesting. Today in most schools I think we are so taught to be problem solver more than being creative. Being creative doesn't just apply to art and literature, but really everything. Sometimes great thinkers can't manage to come with some ideas, even though they are great thinkers and they could have come with it, just because they were so closed into some point of view. Creativity really enlarges your point of view and helps you to reach your full potential by coming up with ideas you already have but didn't have the tools to reveal them.
This course  will help you to build declarative and procedural knowledge about creative thinking process, tools and techniques. As mentioned in the introduction of the course this will introduce you with tools and techniques and build your understanding around usability also. Helps you to build your thinking connections that in which situations you can implement the tools and how to implement. These tools and techniques have super wide range of usability from personal to professional, from IT, Product creation, Writing script, finding solution, building solution and more. worth to invest time and energy.
It was a great learning experience. The way the course is designed gave me a boost to delve more into the topic, it was super interesting because of course instructor Sir Peter Childs. He did his best to keep to the course interactive with full of knowledge, even every task that we have done were filled with creativity. We got a fair chance to describe our views and to show our creativity. I would surely recommend this course to all my mates. Once again thank you to Coursera for providing such a platform and course instructor Peter Childs sir for delivering the course so nicely.
This was my first online course i have enrolled (not just specifically in Coursera but overall, in my life) and i have to admit i am amazed how interactive and effective it is. And by attending this course i am even more eager to embark on more and more of the online courses.  I truly enjoyed it and found it very effective in terms of materials given, structure and way of presenting the knowledge. This course enlightened me to go deeper into certain specific subjects i.e  TRIZ and SCAMPER. Big thanks to Prof. Childs and the whole team for creating this course.
An excellent program. I have come across a few of these tools and even undertaken techqniues like brainstorming before but it was very good to learn some complex new ones, and to see them described and applied in one place. The video sessions with students of the college especially helped to illustrate how these could be used. The case studies helped to provide additional examples and the aassignments helped reinforce through use, the techniques we've learnt. Excellent effort on the part of the team lead by Peter. Well done! And thank you!
I wasn't sure in the starting about how this course is going to turn out but the day I started this course, I have spend more time working on it than I thought I would be. I must the creators have done a great job on this online course, it's just too much fun to do the quiz & assignments. I have learned a lot from this and also the content and quality of the lecture videos are too good and nice. It was a excellent experience for me & I am definitely going to use these techniques in my future wherever possible.
Excellent course with exposure to many practical applications of many techniques.
It was a great learning to 
complete this course. I am developing a program to integrate Triz, 
Effects Database and idea generation as a fertile ground to nourish 
creative problem solving process. This course is very useful for that 
too.  I am grateful to Mr Peter Childs for the excellent course so well 
designed that all professionals can learn something which can last 
forever to be a creative person
Excellent course and excellent instructor. A simple course touches upon the basics of several creativity tools. More tools exist than this course teaches; however, the instructor Prof. Childs explains how these tools are complementary, and thus chosen in the syllabus. An excellent refresher for someone who already knows the field or introduction for new comers. One may consider taking the course even if it is not immediately relevant to one’s life. Everybody can learn valuable insights
This course offers systematic and practical knowledge in terms of creativity. Thanks to the eloquent professor, explanatory videos, compelling assignments and intresting discussion prompts the course offers thorough knowledge of creativity tools. The tools provided can be implemented in both personal and professional life and each of them offers different approaches and ways to reach creative solution. An overall engaging and helpful course which I cannot recommend enough!
It's been such a pleasure to complete this course. Before taking it, I am an emotion labour and don't know whatever it takes.  I have been refreshed myself and worked with intelligence mind. During almost my university-driven learning times, I can't solve any problems related to my job, that is to say I have to ask many people about it. Shame on me! Now a few questions about myself are answered and it leads me to a new revolution. Thanks Professor Peter Childs so much!
This is an incredibly useful course for developing creativity! So much valuable, practical information was provided in this course. I thank the founders of this course for their work, for the really working tools for developing creative thinking that can be used in any field of activity, both individually and when working in groups. I am happy to be a student who has completed this course and, at the same time, I am sorry that this journey has ended.
i am really happy to undertake and complete such a wonderful course on creative thinking - great videos and wonderful demonstration by prof.Peter with his students. It gave us more understanding on the concepts. i am a professor in design school and this course has helped me to learn lot of new concepts. i assure these will be applied in my teaching lifelong. once again i thank the team for designing such a useful and fruitful course in "creativity"
The course was very enriching and an eye-opener to a world of multiple tools for thinking techniques. I was spell-bounded to the course through the duration. Every moment was a time of new discovery. Oh, Prof. Peter Childs was a joy to listen to. His profound understanding of the subject and practical application was a well of knowledge to me. The knowledge i have garnered from this course will no doubt aid my decision making in my profession.
Everyone should take this course to boost their creativity! I love the mix of theory and application leaving learners to really practice all concepts. One thing that needs to be improved is the filtering in the discussion area as some people are not submitting anything or non-sensical phrases or sentences. Overall, if you want to improve creative thinking, this course is a must take. Thank you to Peter Childs and the team for this course.
i really love this course as i gained more than i expected. also it opens to my eyes and gives me a clear understanding of creative thinking. learnt the different tools of creative thinking, good visuals, clear sounds, interaction with other participants. i really love this course and i recommend it to everyone looking forward to think out of the box with the everyday challenges they are faced with.
Beautiful. When you realize that even the simplest technique is really powerful tool that helps in Idea creation. This course will help you realize that you too are a creative thinker. Our mind is a powerful tool and we need just to make it believe what its capable of. This course can help with that. Don't forget to actively engage in the given tasks. Your participation is an important factor.
Very useful course for someone who is working in the marketing or agency field where new ideas are essential for work. Highly recommend for someone who wants to have a techniques to generate creative idea not only by themselves but also in team. I have to be honest that It's been a tough 7 weeks with several assignments & quiz on what we actually learn from the course.
FIRST  OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU TO GIVEN ME OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN BUTT IN THE DIFFERENT WAY ,SECONDLY THE CREATIVE THINKING TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS FOR SUCCESS REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME AND THE RECENT CAREER . BEING A CONCIERGE MANAGER IN PEARL CONTINENTAL HOTEL IN LAHORE PAKISTAN , THAT THE REALLY STRONG  TOOLS FOR MY HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY
This course is great to keep challenging ourselves with right tools and mindset to traverse through randomization, combination and systematic approaches for creativity.As rightly mentioned by our mentor Peter Child, creativity is imagination with responsibility. Thank you so much for opening the doors towards this path for success.
The entire course was really amazing and it gave me a wonderful experience in understanding the various ways of creative thinking throughout the course. I Thank coursera for this wonderful experience and opportunity. My heartfelt thanks to Peter childs the course instructor for his wonderful way of explaining the concepts .😊😊😊
The course was great! It teaches many different techniques which can be used in our daily routine. I'm sure I will be able to use some these techniques in my working also. Regarding other techniques, such as TRIZ, I'm curious to learn more. It was a pleasant experience, I could learn and also have fun with some tasks!
I had an excellent experience participating in this virtual course! The instructor's enthusiasm for the topic of creativity was very evident in the video lectures. I learned a lot that I can apply in my personal and professional life. If you are at all interested in this subject, I would highly recommend this course!
Creative Thinking Techniques and Tools for Success is a very interesting and useful course. It is complete with clear instructions, examples, videos, opportunities to use the techniques learnt and evaluation and feedback. What I learnt is very versatile and can be used in personal as well as professional situations.
This course is fascinating!! The techniques you can learn in this course is priceless!! No matter who you are, if you are a human being, you have to attend this course for enhancing your creativeness so that you can come up with better solutions for the problem you face. This course is fun and eyes-opening!!
It gives me great pleasure to announce that I have passed course "Creative Thinking: Techniques and Tools for Success" with Grade 91.50%.
I do recommend this course to my colleagues, as it has lots of benefits, new skills and new thinking concepts such as how to think creatively and innovatively.
Thank you very much for creating this chance during these days. I am very happy for taking part in your course. I have improved my knowledge and experience. I think my lessons will be more productive in future. I wish the organizers of this course good health, happiness and success in this life.
I have discovered a lot of powerful and useful techniques for creative problem solving. Now I feel that I've got a couple of smart decisions for my career development and the development of my YouTube channel. The tasks are very interesting and unique. Thank you our dear professor Peter Childs!
Well thought out course of instruction that starts from the beginning indeed and carefully guides the learner in the knowledge delivery. Exercises and videos are introduced to enhance understanding. At the end one has a full understanding of what has been sought to imparted. Good time spent.
I love this course. It's my first course in Coursera and it was very challenging. All the brainstorming, sketching and listing down of different ideas are fun and exciting! Although it was a little hard on my part since my internet connection sometimes fails. But overall, it was very good.
Thanks to the creator of the course, I am able to learn new techniques about creativity which is something unheard of at the first place. I hope you could create other courses not exactly for creativity but more resemblance to it like cognitive behaviour, psychology, art behaviour, etc.
This course is very well designed. The contents are concise and easy to navigate through. Demonstrations of activities were really useful for completing assignments. The quality of the course is beyond my expectation. The instructor was fantastic. Thank you for delivering this course.
I enjoy this course . I am not a English native speaker so its takes a little time to understand the concept sometimes. and the quiz and assignment are challenging for me. with the help of peers i can complete tthis course! thank you Imperial College London for offering this course!
This is one of the best MooC I have ever taken. It allows anyone to be creative through its systematic approach of thinking. This course also tells about the thinking process of mind at different level, time and situation. I heartly thank to the instructor for this wonderful course.
A challenging yet practical course, I was pleasantly surprised to be introduced to creativity tools in fields like mechanical engineering and architecture. At the same time, it's very applicable and relevant to our daily lives. I love the new creativity toolkit I have. Thank you!
Even as a senior level exec, I found this to be crucial as the tools discussed gave me methods to look at problems from different perspectives in order to make better decisions. TRIZ and SCAMPER may benefit from more time and/or more examples to explain as they are quite complex.
It's an outstanding course for learning these creativity tools. The tools are useful in many domains, and I will put those in use very soon. If you are interested in these tools to expand your knowledge on solving problems, this is a recommended course for all of you. Enjoy !
Really amazing course, delivered by a very sound instructor, Prof. Peter Childs. I feel very privileged, and would indeed recommend this to anyone who would want to consider. Thank you very much Imperial College London and Cousera. Looking forward to claiming my certificate.

This course provides theories and practices in creative thinking. I am personally a person from the social science side, but this course develop a systematic process of thinking to help us for better creativity to see the problems clearer, and solve its smarter.
This course catches your eyes from the very beginning. Not only does it teach you from scratch to implementation of the creativity techniques but also shows how to apply them by doing some activities alone and with peers. I learnt a lot and highly recommend it!
An excellent way to spend time becoming more aware of your own creativity and learning tools that can be used in your professional and personal spheres. I was able to immediately implement the tools and skills learned each week into my work and my time at home.
