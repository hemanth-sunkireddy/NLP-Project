It is really slopy and for experienced users, you just waste your time, and for new users, you do not learn how to actually do things, also, there are some mistakes like spelling and repeated options in the exams.
ARE ONLY QUESTIONNAIRES
The coresponding files to the videos where missing components and elements at times.The course could have been more effective if it focused on all design aspects of a single project .
The quiz questions were not as challenging as the ones I got for my Atkins interview test.
it will be a lot helpful if we get the videos in details about the topics
Good course, teaching a lot of useful commands and general understanding of the Revit aspects. Unfortunately, some of the Quiz questions lagging (even if the answer is correct it was showing that it is wrong). but it was my be 2 times. Some of videos did not provide clear answer for some of the quiz questions. However, overall course is really good!
The videos were excellent and provided full and clear explanaitions of every topic, easy to follow and at just the right length, nor short nor too long. Very complete files and materials downloads provided though.I found some answers to the questions not correct nor suitable for the topic asked, and that wold confuse me a little somtimes
This course is very educational,especially for professionals who want to upgrade their knowledge about revit architecture.I am grateful for learning this course and want to thank coursera and Autodesk for providing this opportunity.
complete and challenging it gives a good example of what the exam related can be. Pleased to have had the opportunity to follow this course and -proud to have been able to get the certificate at the end.
I found the course to be very educational and useful. I only wish there had been more peer-reviewed assessments, as that was very helpful.
Beautiful, informative. But it needs some review because there are some language mistakes and other unclear questions.
Awesome course great coving of subject and organzation could have been more explanatory and resourceful.
It is really helpful for those who are begginers with Revit and want to improve their skills.
Site detailing could be explained more, like to place roads and other landscaping elements
This course is quite helpful to enhance the knowledge.
Contain some mistakes in the tests.
Revit is the best for architectural

Excelente curso, ayudó a mejorar mis habilidades utilizando Revit. Muy conforme con los videos y el proceso de aprendizaje.
It is one of the best online learning platforms to get better knowledge with variable certificate
This course was really of intermediate level as I found myself struggling at times to get my knowledge of Revit design software correct. I reviewed the course material(video and practical solutions) more than once to answer the multiple choice questions and arrived at a good score. Having previously used this software for office work at a real estate company I am contented to be now certified by Coursera also.
This was a great experience personally for me. Though I had experience in designing models in revit this program provide me such great knowledge which are not very familiar  with most number of studemts such as documentation, work sharing, detail components and etc. So i highly recommend you to follow this course without any doubt. Cheers!!!!!
El curso fué muy útil, aprendí muchas cosas en especial las herramientas que se tiene para hacer un trabajo profesional y con mejor manejo se tendrá cada trabajo en el menor tiempo posible.
Honestly, this course has been even beyond my expectations! I learned things that I even did not know that we can do in Revit! Revit has everything that designing a project needs!
This course is really good ,it helps me a lot . I learned a new software from it and it help me to upgrade my skill without going to any academy and institute Thank you.
Excelentes ejercicios, pero debería tener un traductor en español o subtitulos en español, muchos términos no se traducen de la misma manera al español
¡Es un gran curso! Bien estructurado y muy profesional. Es una gran introducción y guía para la certificación desde un enfoque básico

I feel satisfied taking the course. The instructor is good at his job. I recommend this course to you.

Great course for learning and understanding all about Revit concepts in architectural modelling.
It covers all the things about it and now you just need more practice to upskill further.
I really liked it! It goes trough several important topics and explains it in an easy way
the way of explaining is good and it needs to improve according to software improvement
