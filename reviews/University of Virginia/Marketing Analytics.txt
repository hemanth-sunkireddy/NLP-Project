This is one of the most terrible courses on Coursera. Thank God I received it for free and wasted no more than 3 days. The instructor cannot impart knowledge well. The course itself is not meant for beginners. So be careful before wasting your time and (money). The presentation is sub-par. What the instructor writes and speaks can only be understood by him. Somehow you will be able to drag through two weeks of material. But when you reach the third week, you will realize that you have wasted your precious time. The formulas are just rushed through. And the new terms are not even explained before being introduced. If you are not fond of complex calculations, kindly opt-out. Don't believe me? Check out the discussion forums, the people there have no idea either. They just type random stuff to see what others are typing. The instructor's accent (Indian) makes it worse. And trust me, this review is coming from an Indian. I don't know what's it going to take for me to convince you, but the fact that it was pretty low on ratings on classcentral.com and other things should give you a clue. Also, I wouldn't waste so much time to convince you guys. It's not worth it, even for free! To be honest, this course makes a mockery out of Darden School of Business. Check out other courses from lower-ranked colleges, you will be surprised how fun it is to learn using MOOCs. Thank you for reading such a long review but I think everybody should know what lies ahead!
Quiz questions are filled with misspelled words, incorrect & thus confusing grammar, additional random words or letters that add to the confusion. Also, questions are vague and answers are specific and visa-versa. This makes the corse not about learning or testing one's knowledge, but instead about guessing what the question writer was thinking at the moment they wrote the question. If the material was presented with clearer communication, the quiz questions and answers used correct grammar, spelling and appropriate parallelism, this course would be educational. Until those changes are made, this course fails to be educational to those of us who are not clairvoyant.
In short the instructor seems himself packed in a heavy dust of confusion. At the very onset, I vehemently took patience in listening to what he was saying. But gradually in the week#2 module I couldn't even grasped what the instructor actually tried to convey. I myself is an MBA and work in a prestigious Indian company and when it come to analytics, I believe it should be filled up with live examples, scenarios, assumptions and calculations. To my surprise, I found the faculty was nowhere close to such epitomes. Besides, his lecture deliverable seemed mostly reading the transcripts rather than explaining. If I've to take help from Youtube and Internet to understand the BAV model despite having a course from such a prestigious brand Coursera, then I think it's better to call the day off for good.I was actually thinking to buy some of the courses, but now I've realized switching to other routes might be imminently prominent.You guys are teaching about the propensity and effectiveness of various brands in this module. I hope you all do the homework for delivering the promises that you people are offering.I'm disheartened and leaving the course mid-way. Hope Coursera team comes with concrete solutions for learners who aren't only for the certificates but also to garner knowledge.Disappointed!
The course was overall taught very poorly by the instructor who seemed to be substandard. There were no proper explanations on how one proceed with the given formulae, lot of  difficult terms used in the course throughout without bothering to explain what it meant. Not recommended for begineers, might be helpful for those who only want to revise.
As one of the fellow review have published, this course is not engaging because of the lecturer's accent, weak-structure lessons, lack of conclusions/key points for each lesson, the content is all over the place about one case study and irrelevant quiz. It's a waste of time for me
That portion of CLV in week 3.  I don't know how he calculated the 5 years  CLV and then how he wrongly derives the formula of CLV for credit users. He himself told in the video that he is not good in maths, I didn't complete that course after that much confusion.
The content is very bad and there is a prolongation in the theoretical content. On the contrary, in the applied content a little jumps from important definitions besides he does not explain, but you feel that he is just a reader..a very bad course
I haven't recieved my week 4 peer graded assignment grade yet and i am waiting for it from a month. Please please please provide me with the grade so i can receive my certificate.Please i request you to provide my grade it's been a month now.
My course was completed in June but the grades are not assigned even till today Aug 17, 2020. I did reset my course timeline once and even now it's asking me to rest again.The main problem is no customer support to assist during such issues.
I am really desperate, it is a waste of time, training without explanations 1000 different terms for one thing, complication, disorder, inexplicit, not at all clear  

it doesn't even deserve a star
I quit . there are several problems The professor does not explain some points in the lecture, some of th the quizzes do not work properly.
peer eval doesnt work and nobody checked my outputs... lost my interest after a few weeks since theres no progress on these concerns
Not very in depth. Half of the peer reviewed assignments I marked people had cheated on. Not suggested for Data Scientists.
Some videos are not full in duration. The instructors Indian accent hurts my ear. He did mistakes in several points too.
I can't understand some of the topics and has some very vague explanations. I also don't like how the quiz are phrased.
The instructor doesn't delve too much to explain formulas and methods about how to handle metrics and figures.
People are falsely giving me wrong marks in the assignment and it keeps getting hard every coming week.
I did not understand a little bit. The professor is contradicting himself and confusing others.
Vague English and Overwhelmed Quiz questions while just giving one perpective to look :/
Waaaaaay too much work. Not a break down of all parts to pryamids/charts, only examples.
In the beginning it was mentioned that it’s free course but in the end I have to pay
The practice quizzes are not constructed in the comprehensive way.
The lecturer makes this more confusing then it has to be.
This evaluators of this course seems to be quite lazy
my peer review is still not done. this is hopeless
The instructor himself not explaining well...
too basic n theoretical, unnecessary jokes
This course is much more difficult
A little be difficult for me.
pourquoi les quiz sont payés
course is too advanveYes
Cannot unsubscribe !
sucks
basic. Not advanced enough no real analysis to be done. no hands on activitythe whole course can be summarised with little more then the 3/4 fomula's cheatsheet + few slides +a bit of common sense.The level is similar to a 1st year marketing  major bachelor degree.
The course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class. The quiz was far harder than it should have been, mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas.
This course lacked in depth and breadth of content. It was so light and basic, it took me 5 days to wrap it up
Whilst there were some fascinating concepts taught in this course, surprisingly within the realm of branding - I found it challenging to stay motivated to complete it mostly due to the instructor's style of teaching. His sentence structures were often long, trying to say so much yet nothing at all. This translated to the quiz questions which left me confused with the answers provided. Granted the instructor thought he was being novel/entertaining by using the cameraman as an example, more often than not, his anecdotes were cringeworthy & left me just speechless. The grading system was also flawed, almost making it impossible to 'fail' a peer, even when that peer had clearly plagiarised the entire project. Overall, I wasn't impressed & won't be taking any of his or this university's courses in the future. If you'd still like to, I'd recommend to just read through the transcript quickly & lower your expectations.
The professor's joke about the vegetables and squashes are very bad jokes and becomes very annoying as the class goes one. The numbers are old and should be updated. The content is very light and the application exercises are not very applicable in real life. Peer-reviews are so subjective... But i learned a few things, so not all bad I guess
The course introduction shows that the course is based on data analytics but you need to pass some weeks to get the analytic parts. it doesn't meet my requirements and not the same as was introduced. The contents different from the quiz and every try makes the quiz questions change. That mean I never know what the correct answer was.
I feel like points the instructor talking are not well-organized. It's hard to follow and sometimes it's just full of reading (from what he already wrote down).
The principles I'm sure are highly useful, but it's poorly explained and hard to follow.
Typical university course: low level of practical understanding or usability.
Lecturer was not very clear and made the experience not as easy as it should
I dont dowloand my certificate complete please help me
It could have been better with more important topics
last week very bad class no proper explanations
Was expecting more analytics content.
The course content is average.
Difficult to follow.
Good theoretical knowledge. The program create awareness about Marketing analytics, The program could be improved with more detailed examples across different industry. It would be logical to have a part 2 where theory is applied for practical learning.
The instructor was extremely hard to understand at times due to his accent, and I personally feel topics could've been explained more thoroughly and clearly for easier understanding for the students.
Good examples for calculations are used. For the peer assignments, I try to adapt the questions to the industry that I'm working in to apply knowledge learnt to real work applications. Some parts may need to be clearer, for example, even if you are not going to go through the formula of R-squared, it will be good to inform the learners how the number originated.However, there is much disappointment in the experience I have gone through when it comes to the peer assignment as I observed many submissions to be copied from the sample report given by the course and the candidates only went about changing brand names and city name to submit their work. The copying was so bad to the extent that some of the candidates did not bother to even make changes to other variables (such as summer and winter season) stated in the sample copy when the cities they have named do not even have 4 seasons. We will really need to look into the effectiveness of peer review as it affects not only on the work put out by such candidates, but also how effective are these candidates in reviewing true good  work when they are unsure of the content itself -- which possibly signifies why they had to copy. This is eventually reflected in the scores they give others and also their remarks, which was mandatory during the peer review. True meaning of education is acquiring knowledge, not just getting a certificate. Hope the rest of the candidates on this platform understands. They will affect the value of the certificates of such meaningful courses to drop in credibility and value in the hiring and educational field.
This is an absolute waste of time if you have any background or prior understanding of marketing basics, such as what a brand is, or can reasonably guess the types of data companies have on their users. I could see this being useful for someone with little or no prior background but this is in exceptionally untechnical, seemingly outdated course teaching exceptionally broad strokes. There are also clear lacks of deeper thoughts into things as if they're rushing to check-off the topics and keep moving.If you want Marketing Analytics skills or a deeper understanding, there are far better courses on here like Wharton or one of them. This feels like an Undergraduate introductory course  from a middle-of-the-pack school with a nice guy as professor. But not worth you time if you even somewhat know what you're talking about already.
It says it's a beginner's course, but I personally found it pretty hard. I have zero knowledge of marketing, and sometimes I understood the formulas and everything, but then the questions on the test were completely different and I had no idea what to do. I think it would be good for Coursera to provide the answers for the practice quizzes if you get an answer wrong - because I kept getting answers wrong, re-watching the video, still getting the answer wrong, and I just had no way of improving or figuring out my mistake. I withdrew from this course because I couldn't progress without this feedback
Started off as a good course but eventually came with its own set of flaws. Most of the data being provided is from 2014 or so and is hence extremely outdated. Could do with some more current/relevant data. Also, some of the questions in the test are unnecessary and redundant. Be it the quiz or the final tests. Could have more of application based questions instead of questions on the theoretical parts. Raj's teachings however were phenomenal. Overall, a good course but could be much better.
It's not what I was expecting. I don't feel comfortable with the way the instructor conveys the topics of the course. On the other hand, in general, I found the content too soft (and I do not have a marketing background) so I get bored easily with the lessons. Since I am more a quant person, I was hoping to delve into the quantitative approaches to analyze marketing data but simply the course isn't designed that way. Maybe I did not read the description carefully.
Material is interesting and the instructor seems knowledgable however he does not explain concepts clearly and moves way too fast. Formulas are not provided and quizzes test concepts not taught. I spent a lot of time conducting outside research to actually learn concepts. I was also disappointed in the lack of resources for help. I wish the instructor or mentors were available in the discussion forums.
The course was good enough. It had enough problems and assignments to give a clear understanding of the concepts. Although the explanation was mostly understandable and simple, in a few areas, like in the experiments module and calculation of sales lift, it got very confusing. I had difficulty in understanding that module. Nonetheless, this course proved valuable to me.
While the course was fairly easy to get through, I wish the professor would introduce formulas in its blank form before filling it in with examples. I struggle with math and it's difficult to try to learn a formula and how to apply it to certain marketing techniques outside of the course when your only exposure to it is filled with example numbers.
It covers basics of marketing analytics and not a very advanced level. For advanced levels you may want to look at other courses on MA. The professor is good and helps gain understanding of the topic succinctly . It is good to start with but advanced knowledge will be required to better understand the topic.
The course content is not very well organized or structured, it makes the content forgetable and I always find myself missing the key points of the course. And the course material is mostly words or charts, so it's actually a bit boring. Hope the developer of this course can add more elements to it.
Quite informative but the instructor need to be more clear in his explanation. More than once I found error in his formula. That results in more confusion for the viewer. Worst part is him going overboard with squash and vegetable analogy. Please stop dad jokes.
Explanations were quite difficult to follow and exams contained questions that weren't explained properly during the videos. Questions should be in line with examples of the video classes and I felt some of them were more complicated.
I believe there should have been a little more in depth discussion and application and regression. The content of week 1 does not include any squash!! so I believe a course on analytics without numbers seemed quite weird
Assignments could be  more comprehensive and more practical tasks ensured deeper learning. Moreover, topics like CLV were not covered in detail. Else the course was good for someone will no or little knowledge. Cheers!
The course provides good background information about marketing and basic analytics methods. But there are not many examples in each module and not enough mathematical explanation for each calculation.
I wished there was more of a breakdown of how to use excel to compute R square and essential metrics for a regression line. The course seems a bit outdated. The instructor was a bit repetitive..
Brilliantly designed CourseCalculations have to be explained more Logically, especially regressionI ,being a statistics student ,could not understand the logic behind the calculations done
High level introductory course into marketing analytics, but mostly theoretical. More hands on session would be really helpful in driving the concepts into practice.
want a little bit more clarification about all thing all this tech in short but I learnt to many new things and also how to apply things which I know.
this course is great except it didn't explained the practical analytic tools. the math done and things put together is confusing
Some areas are very easy whereas some areas are very difficult. There is no alignment in the syllabus. Can look over the issue.
Very good information a little confusion with the regression it's like doing algebra but I like the course.
very basic coverage of all the topic, i was expecting some in depth knowledge for the price i have paid
More of theory and less of practical experience.  But a nice experience for beginners
the course was knowledgeable, although more emphasis could be given on explanation.
The information itself is ok, but I was not a fan of the actual "story-telling".
Compared to the other courses that I have done this was not very interesting
This teacher is not very good explaining.. besides.. he goes pretty fast
The first lessons were really good then the quality went down.
Felt that the course is too basic. Should have more details.
It has great content. A good investment of your time.
Should have been more practical in terms of hands-on
less relation between course content and Quiz
a bit complicated after 3 week onwards
Interesting, and helpful.
Not bad by the now
I am so impressed with this course! Professor Venkatesan explained the marketing concepts analytics tools, which previously were difficult for me to understand, in very simple terms and suing multiple relevant cases. Also I am very happy with how the quizzes are designed because they motivated me to keep trying until I understood the concept. The questions really tested my understanding and I was really grateful for that because I feel I truly learned. The only thing I hope could change, would be the feedback and grading system for the assignments. Understandably as it is an online course, I do not expect the Professor to grade and give feedback on them. However I would still appreciate if I could see any sort of feedback from faculty that would help me judge my performance on the assignment as well.
The course served as a good start for me into analytics part of marketing. However, I do believe those were basic stuffs but I am satisfied with the course content, ease, duration and its introductory approach. I am hopeful that this course paves way for analytics enthusiasts to work in the marketing domain. Further, the course could include different levels of difficulty that a learner could select before beginning any assessment or after completing one. The problems that I faced in the assessment were easy to solve but I understand there are learners without a quantitative educational background and therefore, having different difficulty levels could help in addressing larger chunk of learners.
While slightly difficult the professor did a fantastic job of adding humor to make the class more engaging.  He started with the general principles of the course material to give us a basic understanding and then followed it up with with the reinforcing technical knowledge of the equations.  My only complaints are the information comes at you very quickly and when complex requires rewinding several times to understand.  Also I wish some of the work was actually linked to some analytic software to get a real feel for what the interaction would be like in real world situations taking the information directly from the dashboard and implementing it into a strategy.
The course is designed very well and structured in an appropriate way.  There is lots of new information and practical examples.  The interviews in the end of the course are of particular interest.  Not so much math, although several quizzes had interesting calculations questions.  Some videos are long-winded, some minor ideas are repeated several times, and sometimes the jokes about vegetables and the cameramen seem odd.  I am not a native speaker and it was hard to understand professor's accent.  Overall, I recommend taking the course and expanding the knowledge in the field.  The course does not require prior deep knowledge of the field.
I am really thankful to Coursera and University of Virginia for creating this course. This course really helped me gain a lot of knowledge about how to value brand equity ,customer lifetime value with the case studies of Snapple,Netflix and IBM. With marketing experiments i got to know about how to measure effectiveness of a campaign. And last and very important i.e. Regression analysis learned me about how to predict consumer behavior and how it connects to economic significance. I am certainly grateful to Raj Sir for teaching me this course.
In my opinion this is a great course to see whether you are interested in the broader field of marketing analytics. You are introduced to many concepts used in this field and get an idea of what some of your responsibilities would be. One thing I would have benefited from is an idea of what kind of software/tools are used to do this work on a daily basis. I am curious about what taking this the next step would be and imagine it would be learning how to use one of the common tools to do this work in industry.
I went into this course expecting to crack Marketing analytics problems- say how Nescafe ads affect sales, or package influences purchase, or how is market share impacted etc. While this isn't as in depth and more of tickling the fundamental levels. It's interesting to learn concepts like CLV, brand valuation models and setting up a common footage with them all! I think overall a good course for someone to understand how and why analytics in marketing is needed than what analytics is needed...
This course was really useful and effective. The content is well prepared for beginners and folks whom do not have any information about Marketing and it is great opportunity for them to get a head start. The instructor, Dr. Venkatesan, was cool and superb and also knowledgable, but the only problem which made me a little annoyed was his accent and it's the reason why I rated this 4-star. Overall it's a great one! Try it!
It was a great course for introducing the world of Marketing to a beginner/novice. With the right mix of concepts and sufficient mathematical backing to hold the intuition, it provided a great experience overall. The professor Raj has a vibrant and cheery personality and uses humor and breaks to supplement his methods of teaching. Had there been more practise problems for solving, it would be great!
Good introductory lectures on the topics. However, as Raj repeatedly makes clear his arithmetic is terrible and thus misleading in many places. If the lectures can't be redone, at least an updated formulary with correct formula should be provided. In many places when he means percentage he uses fraction and viceversa. Otherwise, the course material is all good and informative.
It was very simple to understand after a while, however, if you're a newbie to marketing and if you think marketing is only selling your product then you're very mistaken. At least I was. I would recommend before enrolling into this course you study at least something before enrolling. Also, do get yourself some paper and pens because you'll need to write down some formulas.
The course was overall very good. It was extremely knowledgeable. But the tutorial on 'Projecting Lift' could have been a little explanatory given the questions that were asked in the quiz. I took down all the notes and took the course very seriously but while doing the quizzes when I referred back to the notes from the lecture I thought I am not getting a clear picture.
This course provide very good understanding of Marketing Analytics. The syllabus is designed so well with precise concepts. There are case studies as well which helps to enrich one's decision making skills. There are nice brand examples provided in the course like Snapple, Etch A Sketch and Betty Spaghetty. Overall I enjoyed, learned and developed new skills.
I want to say that the curriculum for first 3 weeks are easy to understand but in 4th week and 5th week a beginner will not understand the concepts  like regression analysis,Breakeven units,lift,contribution margin  so precisely. If the consult faculty  add more key elements and examples to make understand to us...then the course will be a icing on the cake.
The instructor should provide more resources and slides for students' better understanding. As a beginner in the field of Marketing like me, I felt confused in some parts because of inefficient resources and explanation. So, I believe that if you could provide more resources, it would be very excellent! Thank you for your hard work, I really appreciate that.
It is a good course however I personally felt that some places it needed to explain things further. I like to understand a topic while going in depth, here I felt the lack of it while dealing with different topics. Some topics were explained nicely but the course is not supported now and there were no replies in doubts section from teachers side.
The professor was great! Easy to understand. Loved how I could pause my course when I needed and resume anytime that was convenient to my schedule. I learned a lot about what it takes to make a good marketing decision. Hope to use what I learned in real life marketing experiments. -Josephine Fermanian Founder of Mother of Innovation
The course was great, it gives me a whole more understanding towards marketing analytic, Raj was a great teacher. However, I feel like the question, especially when it comes to math equation, the case on quiz is not very exploring our ability, rather it mostly replicating the math and the case that we have faced on the lecture.
Excellent overview of introductory and foundational elements of marketing analytics.  Nice balance of concepts and real life examples.  Introduction but no deep dive into statistical concepts that underlie the analytics.  Needs to be updated for how AI is impacting the use and quantity of data in these models.
This was a very comprehensive course! Professor Venkatesan's good nature , humor and  expertise made many of the classes go by quickly! I do recommend this course to anyone looking to learn more about Marketing Analytics in a manner that is detailed and informative! Thank you, Professor Venkatesan! :)
This is a very compact course. I have learned very crucial calculations. Few times I faced challenged with quiz and calculations. This is not easy, as expected. It will be better if the course slides are more organized. Also, there should be an incorporation of marketing literature and book contents.
I would rate 5 stars if the name of the course was Introduction to Marketing Analytics, since it doesn't go in depth in the matemathical concepts or the reason of use in certain parts of it. Either way, It is a very good course to open up about different ways to doing marketing analytics
Class was wonderful and very insightful.  It was challenging and I had to work very hard.  The only negative, is no access to a professor, mentor, or any other class governance to help you out with questions.  Teachers never respond to emails or questions. Otherwise, highly recommended!
Great course! Was productive despite being concise. The faculty made it easy to understand and grasp the concept, while adding a fair sense of humour to keep the motivation levels high. A good recommended course for anyone who wants to step into analytics in the marketing side.
Some things are not explain so well, and that have a big impact during the course, and in the exams application along the course, but besides that , for me, that course was a good challenge and i learn a lot with Raj, a special thanks for all the crew and eat your vegetables!
I found this was a well-organized fundamental course, despite my slight disappointment that I wanted to gain more knowledge and concepts on some other analysis methods. If you look for analytics course that focuses more on tool or skill, this is not the one.
Extremely useful for beginners. However, it does require a basic understanding of marketing. My recommendations before starting the course1) Brush up basic math2) Brush up basic marketing 3) Get access to Google Analytics (Demo Model) for practical learning
This is a good course in terms of content, but the testing and quizzing is quite relentless. A long practice quiz before every graded quiz just takes too long. Raj is a great teacher, but this course is for people who have a good math ability already.
The course covers all the part of marketing which is really reqied to understand the senario of the market. the faculty member explain it in a very well manner.i like the activity also which they give.over all course is too good and intresting.
It is a nice course for conceptual knowledge on Marketing Analytics. Very nicely delivered by the professor and easy to understand the concepts. i would recommend this course if you want to learn the basic concepts of Marketing Analytics.
I had a lot of fun learning this course. The instructor is very active and tries hard to explain all the aspects of marketing analytics, but it has some points that are hard to understand, maybe it needs more examples. Thank you so much!
Easy to understand and applies to the project you are working on. Explains why you are doing certain things and what extra can you do when you are working on a marketing analytics project.A good course to get your basic clear..
I would recommend this course for beginners in marketing and Professor explained every detail of the concepts clearly. I really enjoy and learn different concepts of marketing analytics. Thank you for offering this course!!
Challenging enough though I felt like he could have delved a little deeper into some aspects....too much surface knowledge and generalization. All in all, a good intro for those looking for an introductory overview of M.A.
Requires a bit of fundamental understanding of statistics to understand and follow better with the course. Some concepts are a bit difficult to understand fully while the math part is rather straightforward and simple.
Really interesting and practical insights gained through this course in the marketing arena! The real life scenario from the specialists shared is very interesting in terms of the applicability of analytics concepts.
The course describes very well the quantitative aspect of marketing. I have learned how to calculate brand equity , Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) , how to design marketing experiments and perform regression analysis.
The course was amazing to take part in. Learnt a lot and was challenged throughout the lessons. The facilitator was very engaging. I would however reccomend shorter modules each week to ensure maximum concentration
Thanks, it made me think in different aspects. However, I don't like how the assignments operated. It is so easy to cheat someone's assignment and someone even cheated my assignment. It was not a nice experience.
Proffessior is really nice and got so much information here. Loved the course although it could be more centric to brands and there should be more case study i feel. But it's fine overall it's great learning.
I like the course in general, but I think marketing analytics will have many more contents than this course contains. Also, some of the calculations in this course are hard to follow. I like the assignments.
A useful course which answered most of the basic questions I had before entering this course. I like the assignment & quiz segments as well, which allowed me to internalise the concepts that were taught. :)
Raj is an entertaining and knowledgable teacher who made this course easy to understand and enjoyable. He uses real world examples and introduces a number of skills, which have inspired me to study further.
Very interesting, very interactive course. I have learnt a lot of new concepts in marketing analytics and it accentuates my willingness to continue my learning in this area. Thank you for the great content!
Good course. I liked it. This is my first course in online. I had good learning during covid 19 pandemic. Thanks to Mr.Rajkumar,  University of Virginia and Coursera platform to do this course successfully
Great Balance of Theory and Practical Understanding. Considering there is a lot of data generated in this world, this course is great  to learn on the uses of data obtained from Marketing process
This is a great and engaging course to learn about brand equity, brand architecture, CLV, marketing experiments and regression analysis. However, not a complete guide for marketing analytics.
It's a very interesting course. demands study and it has some real life examples that may be really useful. Nevertheless, it could work on more actionable tools for the daily management.
The course gives a very good outline to the basics of marketing analytics and its applications. Not time consuming and application oriented. Would recommend it definitely for starters.
I feel the concepts taught are insightful but the professor was not able to convey them properly. I had to google / watch additional Youtube videos in order to get the concepts clear.
This is a tedious course with real hands on experience. Kept me on toes with challenging concepts and quizes. Great  and challenging experience on the whole. Thank you very much Raj!
It would be better if prof can provide more updated (it is 2020 now) practical (some lecture is just a brief introduction, I would like to learn more about how to use it) knowledge.
Its a nice course where we get insight about different strategies used in marketing to calculate sales and how to increase the sales using previous data with little bit of formulas.
The Professor is very humorous and the content is very close to the topic and very useful, practical for audiences. The given examples are quite clear and easy to understand.
super effective ways of learning with raj. Clear explanation and to the point. Helpful quiz and examples through out the course. maybe less peergraded assignment be great.
Very good Course In Marketing Management. Covers all analytical aspects of marketing with real world examples. A must do course for someone who want to practice marketing.
The Materials of this course were good and somehow new; however, the professor's method of teaching was weird! maybe he thought the average age of the audience is 18-20!!
Great tutor and topic. I think a few words can be enhance with daily example like regression calculation. Overall it was great experience to be here. Cheers to vegetable
I'm giving it 4 stars because there are parts that seemed a little bit rushed. The course could have accomplished much more if some details were explained in more depth.
More practice Questions should be there. Also the week-4 content is not that clear due to lack of exact differentiating words. More examples should be included in that.
this course teaches you lots of things. Especially for the people who relate to the marketing and sales field. I enjoyed this course a lot and learned a lot of things.
Very good! Some maths aren't fully detailed so it's hard to know some of the mechanics used but overall this course gives very good insights on Marketing Analytics!
Good instructor. He explained the concept well, but he needs to demonstrate how we can apply it in real life. He needs to make the calculation part easier to learn
course is awesome but it could be more analytical. more algorithms could have explained in addition to regression. Over all its good. waiting for my certificate
Some of the statistical data could use more explanation. I assume a student-professor Q&A portal is not very realistic, but would be useful if able to be done.
The professor is a lot of fun! The course has some basic concepts, but some of them I found too superficial, I'll have to study them more before using at work.
Well structured course with solid content. Helped me get a basic idea to persuade and study further.The squash idea was awesome !! Thanks for the course @UVA
I would love it if they refreshed this course for 2020, but overall it was interesting and provided really good background knowledge on Marketing Analytics.
The Course was nicely designed and covered all the important aspects of the marketing analytics. The teaching style of Raj sir is simply awesome
The course was really insightful with a nice blend of marketing & analytics.Really enjoyed learning and had a great time attending this course.
İts very suitable as a introduction into marketing. However, if the course context will be expanded in any way, it will make better this course
Very important platforms for online certification courses, experimental, effective and qualitative and quantitative approach .................
It was great to get basics insights into various marketing analytics tools and terminology.  The course was well-paced and structured. Thanks.
Superb course &all topics are nice explanation specially math; course can be made more longer may be of  7 to 8 week to cover other topics.
Most of the material is fun and well explained except experimental design, where the concept of break even lift is not clearly explained.
the content was alright, though it could have been made  better by including more examples from the digital world rather than olden days.
The content is very relevant to understand Marketing Analytics. The course is presented through a good enthusiasm, humour at a good pace.
A bit on the easy side for marketing professionals but engaging videos and good exercises that actually forces you to learn the process.
It was a very useful course to brush my marketing skills as well as learn analytics to measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
It was very helpful to learn the basics (even though it didn't look basic) of Marketing Analytics and learning how to interpret data.
because there is always a possibility to do better or may be because i don't know what else should be included. But great course.
This was an amazing and challenging course. Perfect for those who want to add more knowledge about various aspects of marketing.
Going good So Far.. Only issue is we did not discuss how we arrived at the numbers shaded in green. Like  R Squared and P value.
The course had very practical touch to it. Prof Raj is very adept at explaining idea in a manner that it sticks in your head.
Useful, would be interested in taking a further course about R programming in sentiment analysis and regression modelling
Good intro course to marketing analytics! Professor is a little goofy with his squash, but it's endearing after a bit.
This course covers a lot of topics of marketing analytics. A very informative course and good assignments at the end.
Gives enough knowledge to kick off in marketing analytics. Could have been more thorough. Thanks Raj for the effort.

the course structure is but it should be more collaborative.

wish they taught us R-programming and how to do regression

A very good course. If you are a beginner, excellent knowledge gain. If you are a veteran, brilliant refreshing of important concepts and key market indicators. In short, a course worth doing.
I have reached week 4 of this class, and so far, this class has helped me a lot. It's not an intensive class, but for a beginner like me, this provides me with an overall grasp of the field.
1.Excellent way of presentation of topics, i.e., minimum one minute and maximum 9 minutes are used for presentation. 2.Very clearly and to the point explanation with smiling face, which made us to listen properly and creates interest to search the google for value addition. 3.Course covers from the basic of marketing process to using simple, multiple, dummy variable regression and up to the log log regression clearly.4. Mr. Rajkumar Venkatesan is an excellent teacher. He is the man of humble, positive and gentle attitude and teach the subject in joyful way. Excellent course teacher
It is a fantastic course. Before taking this course I only thought that marketing is all about theoretical and survey based. After going through this course my outlook has changed. Marketing has so many analytical and mathematical issues like brand value calculation, regression analysis of marketing, customer life value calculation etc. All these analytics really provided me a better insights on marketing aspects. Special thanks to Professor Rajkumar Venkatesan, University of Virginia and Coursera for offering this course. Highly recommended to those who wants to learn marketing analytics.
I am really happy and proud of myself to having completed this course which i really anticipated to finish. It gave me an insight into how various tools and guidelines are being made use of by marketers to measure or assess the effectiveness of marketing spends. The concepts of Brand Personality, Marketing Experiments, ways of conducting marketing analytics, regression analysis have all added a whole new dimension to my understand of Marketing. As a sales professional i can only say that i feel enriched and blessed to be able to learn so much in such a simple and fun way without the need to shell out huge money.
This was a good and challenging course.  It really gave me the basic foundations of marketing.It challenged me to think and I enjoyed the projects that were incorporated to give hands on training.
An amazing course for anyone who wishes to know how analytics plays a role in various aspects of marketing. The modules centered around marketing process, branding , CLV , brand value and use of regression for marketing decisions were very informative and crisp. The quizzes and assignments were extremely useful to test and apply concepts learnt in modules . The instructor Raj and his team have done a great job in making this course.
Great course.Coursera provides wonderful opportunity for  analytics  learners through the course.Well designed course packed with assignments.Just Loved every lessons of the course.Thank you Coursera.☺
I have learnt a lot. Thanks a Lot to Mr.Rajkumar Venkatesan. Very clear explanation on each and every concept. I have learnt how to apply in real time with the real time data.  Great Learning.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I now have clear concepts regarding marketing, brand asset evaluator, brand architecture, designing marketing experiments and regressions. The course has very impeccably integrated the analytics aspect with the core marketing concepts. Also, a big shoutout to Professor Venkatesan for delivering the lectures in such a fun manner, Loved the addition of squash in every quantitative episode. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to pursue a career in marketing .
This is a great course for someone that is getting marketing metrics classes for the first time. I think the best part was the week 5 final quiz. I really enjoyed the fact that the emphasis of the quiz was on understanding the ideas behind the numbers and not on doing endless calculations. I do understand that in order to master the subject you need to practice the math but before that you really need to understand the concept behind the numbers (this is extremely important in all math related issues).
For a person, like me, Analytics has always been an integral part of my profession. Working on different Analytical Models and Data, I was always inclined towards Marketing Analytics. This course is well developed by Rajkumar Venkatesan Sir and has a wonderful syllabus too. I'm happy that I took the decision and enrolled myself in this course.
It was very helpful for my marketing career.The interview with the real world marketing experts at the end of the course also helps and encourages a lot. Thanks to Raj Venkatesan sir for his effort.
This course was really very well designed and it will definitely help me to interpret the marketing data and analyse it in the right way.thanks to the instructor for making such a great course.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. full of knowledge. Thanks Rajesh sir, for preparing this course
Very insightful course. Thank you very much Coursera and University of Virginia Darden School of Business for this learning opportunity with your Coursera Together initiative. Professor Rajkumar is really an expert and a great instructor. He made the learning valuable and enjoyable. The squash thing is so humorous and definitely a sign that here we are again with numbers! Haha! With regards to the syllabus, it really discussed about the fundamentals of Marketing Analytics and the level of difficulties as basis of the sequencing of the lessons is very ideal. Simplified learning of regression analysis and practical application. Marketing Design Experiment concepts. The activities/assignments let me applied what I've learned.  It was awesome. Recommended to everyone who wants to learn Marketing Analytics and use it in their Sales and Marketing projects, campaigns and investments. Worth it!
The course was very informative and is easy to follow. The professor has a lot of case studies which shows he is a marketing practitioner and shares real/sample cases that help you better understand the concepts taught (not just theoretically). He also supplemented the class with interview/talks with professionals who make use of ROI, Media Attribution and Data collection and they share their advise to students from their own experience. I truly enjoyed this course and learned so much. I have recommended it to my friends who are market research/consumer insight practitioners.
This course taken by Prof. Venkatesan is really good. I learnt How to calculate brand value, CFM and to structure a marketing experiment before and after the lauch of the product. The regression module could have had a little elaborated since many one doesn't possess a  huge knowledge about regression. The interviews of eminent marketing personalities were also helpful to gather a lot of knowledge like the implementation of data analytics in this field. the overall course is very good and the teaching style is impressive. Thank you.
I enjoyed this course very much. I actually used to look forward for the next class after finishing one. This course will be helpful for a beginner like me to understand the basics of marketing analytics. Although I wish we could cover more (in details) in this course, this course cover everything it promised on it's intro.  Mr. Rajkumar Venkatesan who is a very knowledgeable teacher made every class fun. I enjoyed his "Vegetable" classes most. Looking forward to do more courses/classes with him.
I've learned a lot about marketing analytics in just 5 weeks and, though the topic is quite complex, it was an enjoyable and enlightening experience for me. For someone who can easily get lost in numbers, I was able to follow the computation thanks to Raj's step-by-step process. Sometimes, it could be confusing for me, especially if more numbers were presented, but I love that I could get back to the lessons several times for me to review and understand at my own pace.
Thank you for this wonderful course. I have learnt a lot about brands, marketing experiments, and regression analysis. I know understand brand architectures and can calculate brand equity and customer lifetime value. I have had no previous knowledge of commerce and I was really afraid of maths, but the way Professor Raj explained the concepts and made the maths easy has made me more confident in my skills. Thank you again sir for this wonderful course.
If you want to learn some real deal about marketing analytics then you should definitely enroll in this course. This course brilliantly blends different tools from statistics, accounting, and economics and uses to measure marketing efforts. This course will give you a glimpse of how marketing campaigns are measured and decisions are taken based on that data in the real world. I really enjoyed learning this course.
Very helpful and extremely relevant to the present context. As a market research analyst, it deepened my understanding of the many marketing terminologies and jargons and also helped me with my job.
Exceptional professor leading a course on top-priority tools for marketing.  The selection of topics and the thoroughness of their explanations is outstanding.  And although this course is mostly about quantifying many of the intangibles behind marketing, the professor proves himself a sympathetic and warm teacher of bloodless mathematics.  My only criticism concerns some ambiguity around terms: for example the term "log" may refer to 'log base 10' or natural log, base 'e' and this was not clear for me in the presentation. As a suggestion, it would be great if there were a Marketing Analytics II, taught, of course, by the same wonderful professor, Rajkumar Venkatesan.
Thank you so much, that has been an awesome update on my ten years marketing skills... balancing the long and the short term analytics of all marketing activities is key to evolve in this -technology driven- future of ours... THANK YOU professor Rajkumar Venkatesan to lead me through brand architectures, designing experiments, measuring customer lifetime value and regressions in such a pleasant and constructive way. Also all other people involved as also the study fellows in our WhatsApp group that supported each other along the way without telling answers. GREAT!
I was extremely new to marketing when I took up this course. I think I can safely say, that after this course, I have developed an intrinsic understanding of basic marketing terms, and I did so in an engaging and fun manner. Professor Venkatesan did a brilliant job to keep us interested in the subject, and the results are pretty evident. I loved the course.P.s. Professor if you read this, maybe the math could be more extensive. I'd love to learn more about the fundamental calculations and analyses that you mentioned.
Raj made what could be a stale topic rather fun, and he will make you eat your vegetables (you'll see). However, he skips over some elements that you may have to figure out in the practice quizzes. There are two peer-reviewed projects that a lot of people seemed to not meet the requirements for or plagiarize the professor's examples, then give bad marks in return for quality work because we all review at the same time. That's unfair, but I still enjoyed the course and learned a lot.
Great introduction to what goes into Marketing Analytics. The five-week course goes through different topics in an easy to understand manner; it gives a great basis to anyone who's interested in the topic. The quizzes and the two "essays" (one is creating a brand architecture for two different brands and comparing them, the other is designing a marketing experiment) were just difficult enough that you were forced to truly understand the course material before attempting them.
The Course is really good, and helps you increase your knowledge as well as your skills. As nothing comes with perfection there are a few things that can be improved like a better understanding could be given on why things are done like that rather than telling to do so. eg break even lift is really not clear to many people and the forum threads doesn't really work always as nobody knows. The faculty should also check forum threads time to time. Overall its q great course.
I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn some high-level methods of assess a business' value, customer value and product value. The course also provided methods of measuring the bottom line contributions of previous, current and planned marketing campaigns; and approaches to A/B test these campaigns. Lastly, I would recommend purchasing the book that professor Raj Venkatesan co-wrote to gain a more complete understanding of Marketing Analytics.
It was a wonderful experience and great insights into the field of marketing analytics. Any amateur who's new to the field of marketing can learn this very easily. Although it's not designed for industry purpose, it provides deeper insights with industry led examples. The course was never boring and I'm ever grateful to Mr. Rajkumar Venkatesan for walking me through this course. A very useful course for one who wants to gain better insights on Marketing Analytics.
Very Informative and insightful course, i gained a lot of information with regard to types and techniques of analytics, measuring CLV and brand architecture, etc. This course provides you in-depth knowledge with various assignments and practice quizzes conducted over every week. I want to thank Professor Mr Raj for helping me out with various illustrations and videos. Overall an amazing course provided by Coursera,don't miss this opportunity. Thank You.!
Really had fun in this course! I liked the peer graded assignments and the interactive questions in the videos. The instructor was very enthusiastic and fun as well. It helped me lighten the burden of studying numbers!!! :) Overall, I recommend marketers to take this course. It's always better to know how to understand the data when we do campaigns, otherwise, it's like walking towards a cliff with your eyes covered. Well done Prof Raj :)
A very comprehensive course, it covered almost the whole syllabus of marketing analytics and in a very fun manner took us through all the difficult part. Raj is an amazing trainer who keeps the audience engaged in his talk and keeps them interested in the topics being delivered. Overall an amazing course, i recommend everyone who wants to get to know about marketing analytics to go for it. All the best Raj, you've been awesome!
This is one the best course on marketing analytics which I ever studied. I have learnt many new concepts and got a numerous research ideas in Indian context. The segment related to brand equity, CLV and Marketing Design Experiment was very fantastic. This was very fruitful session for me. Thank You for offering this course ..Vipin Kumar Meena, (PhD Scholar,Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi, India)
Extremely valuable course, in the going market environment where big data is changing the way of how companies performed in past. learning analytics is going to provide real help in the future job and the changing  dynamics of how companies analyze data and take actions. The Teacher is super awesome, very polite and friendly way of teaching and providing the key knowledge. Thankyou SIr, ThankYou coursera .
This course by University of Virginia gives you a suitable and deep insight and understanding about various topics related to Marketing Analytics. The pace is comfortable and the content is actually used in the industry. It is actually a beginner level course and really easy to understand. I'd recommend this course to anyone who's trying to start his way in the vast horizon of marketing analytics.
I would like the course to include more data rich assignmnts where students are providded with a complex data rich problem and asked to build analytics model and arrive at decision making process. The data sets could be close to real time situations. This will help them in showcasing their analytical work. Overall I developed good understading about brand architecture and marketing experiments.
The course was really good. It covers most of topics like the Marketing process, Analytics, Brand Architecture, Measuring Brand value, Customer lifetime value, Marketing experiment and finally how to use regression in marketing.  The course not only help me in updating my current knowledge but also taught me how these big companies use analytics to come with different marketing strategies.

Its very nice to learn through online with thorough applications .The faculty is simply superb,loved to listen to him.I strongly recommend, this course is very useful and required for any one in middle and higher executive level to understand the market, advertising, regression etc., for sale of the product in this competitive world.Once agian thanks to Coursera for bringing such cource
Es un buen curso, me  ayudó a fortalecer conocimientos que en la universidad  no se trataron a profundidad, adicional a ello puedo decir que también es una excelente manera de mantener contacto con el idioma inglés, yo soy de habla hispana y la verdad fue, que tener al alcance este tipo de cursos me sirvió mucho para ampliar mi vocabulario en el idioma, específicamente en la carrera.
The instructor was great and the videos were easy to follow. I experienced my first peer-graded work here and the quizzes were challenging. The only point to improve on is sometimes parts of lessons, especially formulas can get easily misunderstood because the explanation was only for one example and doesn't tackle other possible scenarios in which the formula needs to be tweaked.
Marketing Analytics is an Introductory cum Intermediate level course for the people who are willing to get the gist of what marketing is and what are they gonna study in their full time MBA. It is a five week course and in every week there is a different topic to study. It becomes very easy to establish connection between every topic when your tutor is as amazing as Raj. :)
Marketing in depth analysis with real cases industry approach inline with models that used in real world marketing industry. Now I have better confidence to analyze my own product for the marketing based on all materials conveyed by instructor. The numbers looks scary at first, but when you know the formula is exact so the calculation result shows easier to understand.
It's a great platform to learn. Module are very interesting and user friendly. Each and everything is explained with such an ease that it clarifies all things at once. Real time and industry based examples make the topics more relevent and practical. I will recommend this course from coursera to everyone who want to do an online certification in Marketing Analytics.
This course gives a good big picture perspective of marketing analytics. It shows the student where each piece of knowledge fits in the puzzle. It also gives details about how to concretely use the taught skills. It can be challenging sometimes but the difficulty is well balanced. I am happy that I had the opportunity to take this course, I learned a lot.
Perfect course to refresh your acumen on media attributes, regression analysis and ROI varieties that influence the present age of marketing. Delivers on important components of marketing elements such as CLV, Brand Architecture management, casual research and lift calculations with real world experimentation for a thorough and sustainable understanding.
Rajkumar Venkatesan sir is absolutely phenomenal, The way he explained the concepts interaction and funny jokes sometimes always engaged me into this course. I am going to miss sir's lecture and the squash and vegetables. It was a journey filled with fun and knowledge. Thank you sir and Darden school of business University of Virginia for this course.
A fantastic course that introduced me to the world of analytics with solid basics. Seeing it being applied in an exciting field like marketing made the course all the more interesting, and provided me with sound concepts through highly lectures by the instructor and all the engaging assignments. Thanks to Coursera for offering this amazing course! 😁
+ well structured course + I am not mathematician, but all formulas and graphics were totally clear+ you learn not only through lectures and additional materials but also through tests because authors provide explanation to each question - theory at the beginning might seem quite confusing and vague but the rest of the course is great thanks
I was impressed with Dr. Venkatesan's teaching style which made the class informative and fun.  The class touches on pertinent topics in marketing analytics and explores real-world case studies.  It gave me new ways to think about topics such as Customer Lifetime Value that I can apply immediately.  I highly recommend Dr. Venkatesan's class.
This course is very hands-on and detailed, unlike other similar ones I've taken. Prof. Raj does and excellent job combining the "soft" (design, branding, communicaiton, etc.) and "hard" skills (number crunching, formulas, etc.). You will learn how to back-up your arguments with figures and analyze how your actions impact KIPs in your company
It was really great experience to be a part of University of Virginia and I loved this course so much. I think now I am able to applied all these skill of marketing analytics in my career growth. Moreover, the assignments which were provided to use our skills are really in formative and I hope I will be able to learn more courses from you.
I think this module is an excellent crash course for beginners new to marketing. You will have an easy time understanding the material if you have some basic statistics knowledge, as those stats skills are totally transferrable. The lecturer is a great speaker and I could follow the material really well. I also really enjoyed his humour.
Very informative course that teaches almost everything you need to know about Marketing Analytics. The instructor is also very easy to understand and teaches complex terms in a very non-complex way that even a beginner at Marketing would understand. Great course in general, if in doubt just take it and I am sure it will be worth it!
The content of the course was good. The material was good. I liked professor Raj a lot, his method of teaching and describing the concepts is quite good. I have learned so many things from this course. It was nice learning experience. The numerical portions of the course was tough a bit but overall it was nice learning experience.
The course was very helpful and helped me know about Marketing Analytics as an emerging tool for firms to very specifically identify key performance indicators.  It was both information and entertainment.  No words to express how Raj has helped us all sail through.  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to him for the same.
Informative, insightful, useful marketing analytics strategies for a successful marketing career. The brand architecture model was probably my favorite. The professor makes marketing analytics a lot of fun and easy to understand. All modules were fantastic and will be valuable resources moving forward. Eat those vegetables!!!
I really liked the way the course is structured. With every week, concepts were explained in conjunction with a real world firm which makes the course material in sync with real world. The assignments and the discussion forum were quite a nice experience! I'd recommend this course to everyone who is interested in this domain.
If you're looking to touch upon the various key concepts in Marketing Analytics, this course is for you. The content is laid out very neatly with enough quizzes and assignment to strengthen your basic understanding. The instructor has beautifully conducted the course with his sense of humour and fluid method of explanation.
It's my first contact with this discipline and I really appreciate that it's very friendly with beginners. They provide clear explanations and relevant examples to which one can easy relate, as the companies are well known to the public. Highly recommended for those who make their first steps under the marketing curtains
The professor was so great! Personable, funny, knowledgeable. He had great examples and insight, and made it easy to learn not so easy stuff. Hope he comes out with more courses! He broke down marketing analytics better to me than my. masters program did! Loved how he used recent companies and services we can relate to.
This introductory course gives a pretty much clear idea of the basics of marketing analytics. The practical based approach actually works if its taken seriously. Lots of examples covered and the questions are tricky. All in all I have been quite happy with the progress that I have personally made through this course.
This is a wonderful course, which helped me not only in my academics but also in managing my small business. I specially thanks to Raj Sir for his wonderful teachings and great explanation with real corporate world examples. Love you coursera for such wonderful platforms. This is possible only because of coursera.
It was a wonderful experience learning and exploring What Marketing Analytics Is? How it helps Sales?  How Marketing and Sale are Correlated? Statistical and economical analytics, regression, and many such important topics, helped me understand this subject better.  Thank You, Coursera For Providing this Course.
This class was very informative. Although I had never studied Marketing before, I got some insight about real world Marketing Analytics, which can be helpful for me as a high school student hoping to pursue a field of business in the future. I also really loved Professor Raj's attitude throughout the videos. :)
I cannot imagine a full-fledged course in this compact yet simple form. Being a naive learner in the domain of marketing, I have enjoyed the learning to the fullest. I thank the teaching team from the depth of my heart. This course will definitely open me better opportunities to gain entry into market research.
This was my first full fledged Marketing Analytic course which had a good mix of Theory and mathematic supporting it. I gained a lot from Prof. Raj's teach which was focussed, insightful and funny too. The session with the visiting leaders in Marketing was very insightful. It was a great experience learning.
This course is fantastic. I totally enjoyed this course. You will have learned the Marketing Process, Measuring Brand Assets, Customer Lifetime Value, and Marketing Experiment. You will have known how analytics is important for Marketing and Business. Really awesome one! Thank you very much, Mr. Raj, also.
I had a great time learning about measuring brand assets, marketing return on investment, and customer lifetime value. Thank you to Raj, his team, and that darn squash for getting me through it! Highly recommend this course to others looking for a refresher course or a solid intro to Marketing Analytics.
It was an awesome experience while studying with Raj sir. Raj sir itself was a great teacher who makes the course to learn as fun. Thank you Raj sir and Coursera for this great experience. As I am from a middle-class family and not having strong financial support. Thank you for providing me this course.
Excellent for those who have been interested in pursuing a career in this marketing analyst stream. I kindly request you to share certain sources of materials of data with us and for downloading software like R-sys, SAS, SPSS, etc. So that we work practically to improve our learnings to a greater extent
One of the best courses that i have taken on Coursera. Challenging, Excellent delivery and awesome faculty. Hats off to his enthusiasm. Would definitely love to take any other course that he brings up in the future. Thank you for the wonderful knowledge that i have gained post completion of this course.
The flow of the course is crafted very well. The only thing I found missing is practicals on Regression. What I mean to say is, if the practice of Regression would have been conducted on MS excel, it would have been very easy to connect the dots. However, I really liked the course!! Thank you so much.
I would like to thank anyone who is involved in realising this course and of course Prof. Venkatesan for offering and presenting this course in a very interesting way. Prof. Venkatesan brings passion and fun into the course which infects you as a student and keeps you motivated and focused. Thank you.

Over the period of 5 weeks, the course picks 5 fundamental concepts of marketing and discusses it in detail. The best part is the emphasis on numericals which helps us to understand the application of the concepts with respect to sales numbers, revenues and costs.
Great course overall, hard metrics made simple by the professor, which is really appreciated. The only issue I had was with the audio, it sounds terrific sometimes, the voice of the professor can suddenly break and may you rest in pepperonis if you had headphones.
Very informative! Had to go over some videos a couple of times, especially when there were some equations involved. Professor is great and very engaging, quizzes and assignments really measured for understanding. Real case studies and examples. Highly recommended!
Good blending of theory and exercises helps a lot with deep understanding of the concepts taught. 
The Professor's explanation is very clear and easy to follow (partly thanks to the vegetables!). I find the course's content very interesting and useful. Thank you!
