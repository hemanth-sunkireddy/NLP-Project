The topic of the course is crucial and very interesting, however, the Professor way of teaching and representing the materials of the course is boring, not inspiring and creative, I find it a bit outdated.
I was sure I could use this for academy credit. I feel cheated :-(.I guess i learned a valuable lesson, read the fine print.BTW the etymology reading was terrible.
I'd joined free course.      But I've not got my Certificate after completion tha course.
I can't achive a certificate üò¢
i cannot continue course with some items blocked
I really enjoyed the lecturer; what a energetic teacher. Yet I have complaints about the way in which the lectures are presented.  I don't think the convos are the best way for me to grasp the idea, especially for a complex topic as SDGs.
I already knew a great deal of the subject, primarily because I used Lester Brown's book, Plan B as a text for a sustainability sociology course I taught a few years ago.  This course primarily focused on the international efforts to deal with climate change.  I enjoyed it.Steven L. Stoll, American Expat living in Thailand
Incomplete and a bit one-sided. EKC has counter outcomes that are not shared in the course. The decisionmaking of the indicators, as well as measurement methods, are not discussed, which are in my eyes crucial as it cofounds the accountability hierarchy and regulatory governance within the framework.
Sometimes dry in the approach, though the information always seemed relevant. I was never able to enter the discussion forums. It would either continue to load, but never load. Or, I would receive and error message.
TIene una muy poca representaci√≥n femenina, y teniendo el cuenta que el curso habla de los ODS, deja de lado el ODS n√∫mero 5, que promueve la equidad de g√©nero
good introduction; strong focus on environment; would love to have the transcript for download or at least the copy paste function working.
An interesting introduction to sustainable development in terms of both social and environmental sustainability.
It would be better to have more insights about the relation of education and health with SDGs
A short yet useful glimpse into the nuances of the SDGs
Good intro to the SDGS

Well structured, easy to follow basics for understanding the SDGs. Less one star, because the content and resources are already a little bit outdated.
I loved the course and found it covered a lot of ground - and the experts interviewed gave the course good credibility. My only criticisms/areas for improvement would be - a link to / update on the OXFAM Donugth framework paper as it is from 2012 - a more recent update relating to that would have been useful. Also, from a functionality perspective - it's great you can highlight and take notes from videos but if you want to take notes from readings you have to do it OUTSIDE of Coursera - an inbuilt notes tool would be useful to keep all your learnings in one place.
This course, as methodically taught by Katherine (coupled with the discussions with other collaborators) has opened my eyes as a job seeker and as an intending Masters student to understand what the SDGs mean, why they exist, how they came about, the targets they set in clear terms and what my role is in achieving these goals. I have a deeper purpose for wanting a Masters degree and getting a job, I hope getting an opportunity in these two areas of my endeavour gives me an opportunity to attain these SDGs on the long run.
Ce cours est court et intense, permet de se familiariser avec le Programme 2030 et donne acc√®s √† des ressources tr√®s utiles pour approfondir si on le souhaite. Les intervenants sont divers, sp√©cialis√©s et bien inform√©s. L'anglais est fluide et les explications sont claires.Par contre il faut comprendre que c'est un cours d'introduction, assez superficiel (m√™me si on part parfois dans les technicit√©s), qui am√®ne plus de questions (ou de le√ßon de morale) que de r√©ponses concr√®tes.
The course is detailed,cutting age information and well delivered . However some links have been disabled and needs to be 
looked into.It also needs to be up dated .Lastly considering the rigorous  content of the course, the units covered and marks scored should be reflected on the certificate. This will be be better confirmation to employers and peers of the skills and knowledge acquired.
I find this course to be very relevant and engaging. The theories and different perspectives on the SDGs helped a lot in forming my own opinion and have motivated me to learn more about my role in sustainable development. However, I wish that the course would stress the urgency of action even more be more critical towards the role of governments, businesses and consumer behavior.
Very Informative course on the SDGs.The best part was that the goals were explained from the basic level comprising of all the international protocols that took place and what are the key facets that will affect the progress of Sustainable Development Goals.Special mention about Christian Grimes for being an amazing lecturer; taking us through the course in an insightful manner.
The Sustainable Development Goals - A global, transdisciplinary vision for the future is a wonderful course for anyone who wants to have an overview of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. Moreover, the course could have more examples from other countries as well of how they manage to get or not done their national goals within the spectrum of the SDGs.
I have a much deeper understanding of the SDGs, was surprised on the major impact of agriculture on climate change and hope to see Doughnut Economics take hold in my life-time.  I recommend this lesson to anyone whom wants to learn about the relationships that our planet and human kind must come to terms with.
This was a great course which helped me to better the SDGs and global sustainability issues currently being grappled with. A good way to have a better understanding of major issues which we may not be experiencing personally. Really enjoyed the variety of interviewees.
Very insightful course into not just understanding the SDGs but also how they interact. I think the content is highly relevant and well presented. I think the diversity of thought leaders interviewed can be improved to present a more global narrative on these issues.
Very well designed course, Its an wonderful opportunity for everyone to understand about Sustainable development Goals and how one can contribute toward it. I definitely would like to go for further understanding and about SDGs and its impact on my country.
Learnt a lot and  i am very glad i took it. Precise points which get us hooked up to the whole world of SDG's. Highly recommended for students as well as general public who just want to know what the noise about all these SDG's is!
Including more case studies on implementation mechanisms, as well as an update on where we stand, now, in 2020, five years after the establishment of goals, would make the course more practical.
Wonderful course, covered the main parts of Sustainable development goals and some good insight in the selected goals and a way forward on bow we can be able to achieve the Agenda 2030.
Cours vraiment int√©ressant, fouill√©. Les documents compl√©mentaires sont aussi tr√®s bons. Je trouve √ßa n√©anmoins dommage que la version "gratuite" ne permette pas d'effectuer les quizz.
The Course really helped me understand the various aspects of Sustainable development better and how different factors or societal actors can come together and help work on the goals.
The course could include more insight into development challenges of developing countries like India where you could actually find a lot of research around challenging SDG framework.
Good an information but rather biased on terms of the key messages. Did not address any potentially critical either positions or negative developments to any larger degree.
This was a very interesting and enlightening course - I would recommend it to everyone. However, a few of the additional reads, have been removed from the linked servers.
This is an excellent introduction to anyone interested in working with the SDGs. The workload is manageable, but the content still allows to get a deeper understanding.
The Sustainable Development Goals ‚Äì A global, transdisciplinary vision for the future was a very distinguish learning course to know more about human resourcefulness.
Quite explanatory and the pace is wonderful, just wondering if it will be okay to add more images and paint real life situations to buttress the points made therein
The Professor was excellent. The curriculum was appropriate. The only reason I gave this class 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars was because of the Coursera user interface.
I believe this course can be more interactive and interesting . But thanks to our instructor And guest scholars for sharing their knowledge and experiences.
Excellent course to understand the intention behind the SDGs. The readings were extremely insightful to help interconnect the goals and target indicators.
It is a good lesson for who need more education about environment and policy to the future. And also to prepare to reach the better world with SDG goal's.
Great course! The last week was especially eye opening. I just wish I had more information about other SDGs, since the course focuses mostly in a few.
lectures were a bit long so it was difficult to stick to listening just an interview for 20 min or more, otherwise the topics were very interesting
Very informative, liked the animated economics lectures. Making some of the lectures  shorter might help better grasp the message of the course.
It was very informative and right on spot for learning the essentials and getting the overall understanding of SDGs. I highly recommend to all.
This course helps you to fully understand the SDGs and their importance.  And the role each individual has to play to make the SDGs a reality
It was really nice, I love this feature with invited experts in every lecture, but as for me, I need more concreted facts about every goal.
Gained so insight on the course. Very interesting. I paid for the certificate, kindly acknowledge and issue the certificate.Many thanks
A very well structured and informative course on SDGs. The discussions with experts for each module was especially intersting. Thanks
A very good course however I would like to have more information about How to measure including How to compare progress for each goal
Giver en rigtig god forst√•else for menneskehedens udfordringer og mulige l√∏sninger p√• vores og vores efterkommeres udfordringer.
Excellent presentation by the instructor made everything quite easy.I understood the 17 S D Gs clearly.Thanks a lot Coursera.
The course format was good. The learning journey was interesting with videos, reading literature and discussion exercise.
Basic theory course about sustainable development concept is really good!Was curious to found about Doughnut economics.
This class is great, but I think it would be better if it has a longer duration since it's loaded with so many details.
This course is really informative. But if instructor provide presentation slides, it'll be easy to understand more.
The best course about SDG for beginners! Simple and easily learnable. Additional reading materials are useful.
Very informative course that makes each one of us to know more about 17 sustainable development goals
it was a very insightful and helpful course and made me learn about the world around us a bit more
Very informative, good level of content and quizzes, not too easy, but not too challenging either.
A brief yet sophisticated overview of Sustainable Development Goals. I enjoyed this course a lot
Very well organized and relevant. Maybe some of the links and articles should soon be updated
The course is very useful to know the current situation happening in and around our globe.
It requires some knowledge of sustainable development and history on ecological terms
El curso es bueno para aprender mas sobre los SDGs sin embargo no ofrece certificado
It was a very interesting and awesome lectures to know about the sustainability.
Good more free courses can be developed for better understanding of the society.
Great information, but more visuals in the lecture components would be useful.
loved the objective behind the course contents-interviews and short quizzes
I really benefited more from the course than I expected before enrollment.
It was very insightful, however information could delivery was a bit dull.
Good course. Learnt a lot about SGDs and the linkage between each SDGs.
It was great learning and knowing about sustainable development goals
It was a mind blowing and a sustainable period learning here.
really helpful....its worthy to send time with this course.
It was where nice to learn sustainable development goals.
Good but was hoping to understand more about UN workings
I have learned a lot about the SDGs, thank you very much
Great course to understand the basics of the 2030 Agenda
good course given lots of info with easy  understanding
Could be more interactive. Content is very useful.
This course is totally good and informative
clear and rich ,excellent course
Interesting course!!
Thanks. It‚Äôs helpful
I enjoy the course
Fantastic course! I love the design of the course, especially the engagement with guests with various expertise, which provides a broad picture of SDGs as they are interdisciplinary by nature.
A well narrated course on Sustainable Development Goals. I will recommend all the present generation Social Development Professionals should take up the course, to understand the SDGs.
This course opened up my mind to the various challenges confronting human beings in  our world currently. It has made me aware of the important role that I have to play to change the world situation.
Interactive, up to date, relevant and to the point discussions. The course provides an in-depth analysis into SDGs objectives but also core challenges in implementing them.
An outstanding course with an exceptional facilitator and speakers. I have learned so much that I can actually apply to my real world interactions, thank you.
I have satisfied with this course. I got many knowledge about SDG's. In the future, i want to develop my knowledge more and more. I hope I could participate in the next course.
I would recommend this course to any educator who needs a little more understanding about the history and direction of the SDGs.
So glad to participate in the course before starting our business of PE funds and its holding company in Japan. Now in Japan, some enterprises and organisations start applying SDGs to their activities, however, their primary focus is NOT on environmental issues. Rather, they take an easy way to dealing with social equilibrium. It's also good to tackle but I think now is the time to have a hard look at the climate mitigation and environmental issues. Therefore, this course is absolutely good to start. Thank you so much for your help!
I attended this course as a practicing architect and university instructor. The course materials are at a beginner level, which I think is great. This allows us to think in a trans-disciplinary way for the sake of SDGs in the future. I will be definitely interested in another course about SDGs in countries with limited financial resources and/or high density. I am also interested in knowing more about how SDGs are applied since 2015.
its a very important course to learns by all human population so that the efforts to prevent the threat from human activities is shared by all individual not communities or governments. the 17 goal of UN targets could be added to primary schools teaching so that people adapts to respect the environment as a norms
Informative and well structured course on sustainable development goals: it helped me to understand better how we can shape the future by going through the SDGs and chose the actions which can influence the world in a positive manner.
This course fully meet my expectations. It helps to make a clear image of current world situation from different prospectives. Economical, political and ecological issues related to the sustainable develooment are considered.
Must have it for everyone, for every citizen of this world in order to understand better the importance of sustainability goals, and their meaning, that many of us may not even notice or realise
I learnt a whole lot from this course. I gained new knowledge, learned new terms that would forge my future studies. I know more about the SDGs than I did before this course. Thank you for this!
The course is good. It gives us a good introduction to the SDG's of Agenda 2030.
Excellent intro course to the SDGs! I was thrilled by the much care taken by the Prof. Katherine Richardson and her team to provide a clear and easy-to-understand -content on a global topic. I have taken important lessons from this MOOC such as the change in paradigm of Natural resources, the International development of Global sustainable goals, the human condition for reaching the SDGs, and many more. I wish I can apply and outreach the SDGs in my work and in my professional network.Many thanks for all the material and the effort. It is a great time to live in, not only for what our society has done but also for what a challenge we have in front of us  Cheers for the accomplishment of the SDGs and the Global Agenda 2030.
The only improvement I would suggest is a simple check of the computer links.From a private individual's perspective, I would find this a useful introduction to thinking globally and introducing to other private individuals from adolescence to adulthood the very real, undeniable scientific fact that we, the collective wee, need to take responsibility for both changing our own behaviors and insisting our businesses and governments change their policies and action in order to survive as a species on this planet.
The course is very insightful, touching on the inter-connectivity of the SDGs, beaming light on the system approach and role of research in achieving the SDGs. The idea of Inequality and cherry picking was something i had suspected but never knew it has been opinionated on the scale of global economic discussions. Great dynamics with the doughnut economy as well, Professor Katherine Richardson and her guests were so spot on were pellucid in their overall engagement of the course. Now i know more. Thank you,
The course focuses on the entire global perspective of the future we hope to live for the next generation, so that if adopted and gotten used to, they might thrive for more than 10,000 years. The course is so detailed in the shortest way that it focuses on all parts of the world that none of the societies feels left out in terms of highlighting what roles they need to play in achieving the UN 2030 agenda of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
It is a very interessing course because gave to students a global view of the main aspects a global sustainable in the UN framework.However as a Biochemistry sudent I think that in the SDGs 3, 9, 13, 14, e 15 must approach the contaminants and pollutans (chemical) and the explain the difference and the environmental impact. In the micobiological skill the approach was mentioned by Prof Peter Furu, namely the contamination trough animals.
I found this course very interesting and i learnt new concepts which will definitely help in  the uptake of various interventions related to SDGs. The content of the reading material was so good and selection of guest speakers was remarkable. Many thanks to the course instructor for engaging us with a much needed topic that everyone should be cognizant about. Looking forward for more interesting courses like this one.
superb introduction to the SDGs and how they are inter-related and overlapping. A much needed scientific approach to the SDGs and learning about the anthropocene age, and the very inspiring input from the guest lecturers about resilience, doughnut economy and planetary boundaries. A treasure chest for information and insights. On the downside, there was not many "solutions" or opportunities presented within the scope of reaching the goal of Paris Agreement
It's a wonderful course indeed. It has described SDGs issues very elaborately and clearly. I liked the facilitator, Katherine Richardson. She spoke very clearly with sufficient pause and she went slowly which has help learners like me who are not very fluent in English. I am thankful to Copenhagen University and relevant faculties for developing such a rich course.
This course is an eye opener about the happenings around the world. It has broaden my knowledge about the SDGs, it objectives, framework and working principle towards achieveing them. We all are involved and a collective effort of our 'Push' would drive us closer to them. We need to prepare for our better future starting from today.#YesWeCan
The course was outstanding, knowledgeable and based on facts and research. Learning about global sustainable development goals from a well reputed professional and institution was really joyful. I have done Masters, since I was not familiar with some of the key facts about sustainability which this course has bring to me. Thank you
I have had a eye-opening, informative and integrated learning experience with the program. The program covers not only a deeper understating of why the SDGs are important but also provided me with a systems approach guideline that I can put in work for the industry I work for. I appreciate the further reading as well as the videos.
*Those detailed lectures on SDGs and their importance were really helpful and the reading materials after some videos did help a lot.
*Getting to know about the relationship between Resilience and Sustainability was another good score to be added on.
*Those quizzes of Nine questions were helpful enough to think and question myself if I paid much attention to the lectures.
*Opinions coming from different Professors and what measures have had been taken and should be taken, much helped in order for us to understand where we, our countries actually stand and what the purpose of the AGENDA 2030 and also AGENDA 21 really are about.
*About the role of business in SDGs.
Lastly, Thank you Prof. Katherine Richardson for emphasizing on such major topics through your comprehensive lectures but in a precise way and also sharing your knowledge with us. Had a great experience, learning from you.
O curso foi bastante amplo permitindo a compreens√£o do conte√∫do dos ODS, mas essencialmente, a compreens√£o das causas que levaram √† determina√ß√£o desses objectivos. Por outro lado ficou bastante claro que a metodologia para tratar do desenvolvimento sustent√°vel deve ser profundamente alterada, de maneira a atender as necessidades globais dos seres humanos (direitos humanos fundamentais), bem como a sua intera√ß√£o com o meio ambiente, deixando assim de usar-se as m√©tricas quantitativas tradicionais baseadas nos indicadores de crescimento econ√≥mico, em especial o PIB. De facto, o curso √© um apelo a uma mudan√ßa na forma de pensar e de agir de todos os actores do processo de desenvolvimento que partilham, com os mesmos direitos e deveres, o √∫nico planeta de que todos disp√µem.
Very informative course..!! SDG should definitely be made a part of curriculum in schools as well as colleges, because when the students are getting ready and building up their sense of right or wrong in their young age, reading and understanding about sustainability in an interesting way will help them inculcate these values easily and without any additional efforts.  That's the right age when their conditioning can be done in right direction and they can understand sustainability, living with nature instead of inclining towards capitalism, materialism. As after getting higher education, job and loans,no one can and would like to think about sustainability as they get stuck with their duties and responsibilities.
This course offers a beautiful journey for the learner to review the bilateral or collective relations between the SDGs and the efforts made at various levels to reach them in 2030, and the special thing about  this course is the conversations that the lecturer had with the guests from the various disciplines to show the impact of the different contributions on achieving these goalsIn my opinion, this course is necessary for all interested people in sustainable development.And by virtue of my work in the field of sustainable development, we all have roles we must play and give a ‚Äúpush‚Äù to the efforts of our governments to achieve the sustainable development goals.
I got a lot of
knowledge about 17 SDGs, and what is mean by the word Sustainable Development. I
learned how we can measure progress and how the goals are interconnected. How
the human activities are influencing the Earth at the planetary level and
learned the concepts of Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries. How it really focuses
on monitoring and managing human impacts on climate and biodiversity as well as
the potential consequences of failing to meet the goals of the SDGs relating to
climate and biodiversity. Moreover I enjoyed every reading materials and the
clips of the course and thanks for the wonderful course.
This course on SDG helped me to systematically refresh my understanding of SDGs and how progress can be measures. My overall course experience has been quite enjoyable. This is because, the instructor (Kathrine) delivered the course in a structured and professional manner. The reading and reference materials on SDGs further helped to support the lectures too. The fact that the course was divided into 3 modules helped to make step wise progress in learning too. By the way, to what extent Covid19 virus will impact (or complicate) on the implementation and progress of SDGs? Any thoughts on this? Thank you.
I come from a biological sciences background (Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology) and it was refreshing to see the nexus between all these three disciplines and the environmental as well as economic aspects of sustainable development being captured clearly. I appreciate that it was all very easy to absorb. The content was very well demystified and distilled to the core topics/issues. The discussions were engaging and the additional resources were of excellent quality. l also loved the creative videos and the discussions with Oxford and Novozymes counterparts. So, very well put together!
The lectures were delivered excellently by Prof Katherine Richardson. The questions posed to various experts were apt and to the point. I am very much impressed by this course and learnt a lot about the sustainable development goals,  interactions among them, the obstacles in the path of achieving SDGs, the role of various organisations like government, companies, NGOs, Civic Societies, etc. are well explained with appropriate examples. I thank Prof Katherine Richardson personally for her mesmerising lectures and I thank Coursera for the opportunity given to undergo this course.
I think this course has been extremely informative and it gives a real-world picture of the current scenario, in terms of wealth, economy, pollution-i.e in the perspective of global development. It is pertinent for each and every one of us to be informed about these facts,to ensure that we realize our duties as a global citizen and we contribute to sustainable development for our future as well as the future generations. Thoroughly enjoyed the videos and the reading material. Highly recommended!
Well designed course that fulfills its objective of providing clear and concise overview of Sustainable Development Goals and its relevance for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. I believe this course will provide every learners with sense of shared responsibility toward achieving Sustainable development Goals.Thanks to Professor Katherine Richardson and University of Copenhagen for the course & for easy accessibility of the same to every interested individual.
This course really made me think about how our actions interfere in the world in general. The teacher explains everything in a very dinamic and nice way, it's like a conversation, actually. Each week, there is a new subject related to sustainability and each video has an interview with someone from the field and it makes it more interesting. I really recommend the course. Congratulations and thank you to coursera and the University of Copenhagen for giving me this huge opportunity.
It‚Äôs an insightful and well structured course on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Engaging guests with various expertise has added a new dimension. It provides a critical overview on social, economical, environmental and political aspects and their interconnectivity to achieve  sustainable development. Materials helped visualize the global scenarios nicely. Core challenges to implement SDGs has been extraordinarily dealt using real life examples in the course.
A really important course for all parts of the society be it students or even CEOs of large multinational companies. There is an emergency going on in the world and action needs to be taken and with these SDG's a foundation has been laid with goals and objectives that have indicators which will keep on expanding as we go forward and all of us need to align with these goals for a sustainable future where there is complete equality and no one sleeps hungry.
Um bom curso para entender os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustent√°vel (ODS) e sua rela√ß√£o com a sociedade. Possui bom material de apoio para aprofundamento sobre a rela√ß√£o dos Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustent√°vel (ODS) com o planeta e a forma como exploram seus recursos. Abarca as ideias de progresso relacionadas aos danos causados ao planeta e a forma como os ODS contribuem para o arrefecimento da a√ß√£o antr√≥pica ao Planeta de forma extraordin√°ria.
Very well-made and interesting course. To be honest, I did not have really high expectations about this class. I thought it was going to be about "green growth" and how can economies can grow infinitely within a more "sustainable" framework. And thanks to the amazing teacher it was not. It was very critical how our economic system, and gave very inspiring insights about how can Human society evolve differently. Thank you for this course
A very succinct and straight-forward approach of one of the most salient
 topics today and in the near future: sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda. Overall, the course is well structured and 
the materials very appropriate and balanced. Thank you to all the faculty and staff involved to deliver this course, through awareness and skill learning, this is an example of the collective action needed to achieve the SDGs.
A very informative and "to the point" course.  This course highlights the interdependency and the common goal of all 17 SDG's. I would recommend this course to anyone working in health care, education, agriculture, environment, energy, politics, economics...ok, everyone! It is so important to keep this bigger picture in mind, with all its factors, while we continue with our more specific mission, towards a common goal.
Very important course to the current development of the globe in all the perspectives , SDG is guidelines to all for the develop of our community. The course is nicely designed to achieve the target of the subjects, various guest lecturers and resource persons all helped to students to understand the course and the special thanks to the course lecturer, university of  Copenhagen and UN organisations
I really enjoyed how the course is developed using both experts in the field and the UN SDGs reports to give students the opportunity to learn why and how these SDGs were developed.  The complex interconnections between the SDGs does make more sense after the case studies are presented.  Moreover, I liked the instructor so much that I have decided to take more courses that she teaches in Coursera.
The present course is well designed and presented in a comprehensive way, so that the social work practitioners and other developmental professionals would able to avail and it is very useful to them to know the SDGs and its implementation agenda 2030.  Thank you for this opportunity, your team encouraged me to complete the course within time and enabled me to go through several unique concepts.
This course was very insightful and has helped me deepen my knowledge about ways to sustainable development now and in the coming years. More importantly the content was aligned to a global scale which broadened the perspective of sustainability.I highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to know more about the Global Sustainable Development Goals it's aims, importance and challenges.
Entiendo este curso se deber√≠a facilitar en los centros educativos y universidades a estudiantes y profesorado. Deber√≠a ser un requisito para los miembros de cooperaci√≥n internacional y funcionarios gubernamentales, quienes a fin de cuentas son responsables de pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas. Las Naciones Unidas, con representaci√≥n en todos los pa√≠ses miembros, podr√≠a llevar a cabo esta coordinaci√≥n.
The speaker is very knowledgeable of the course content. She asks very critical questions relevant to the issues and content of the Sustainable Development Goals. I learned a better understanding of the goal of promoting the sustainability of the Earth's systems while improving the quality of life among countries. i recommend this course for those learners who want to study the SDGs.
Excellent. Presentation, clarity of concepts, reflections, interactions of all the areas linked to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Visions clearly stated and addressed.
Global context and specific approaches lead to an understanding of the topic and its relevance.
They also encourage social commitment and greater involvement in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
Phenomenal.Katherine Richardson is able to convey information on climate change and sustainable development in associated and vital aspects of life on earth. You get to watch videos as she talks to top thinkers in their field and often associated with the UN. This is excellent curriculum and enjoyable to watch. This class was put together by super competent minds.
I am very happy to have been offered such a course. This course educates us on the importance of conservation of nature and the many problems that humans face due to exploitation of the environment.Others are suffering because of the excessive exploitation of nature by the nations of the First World. It is recommended that such things be included in the study.
A very wonderful and necessary course for all the people around the globe as we all are stakeholders in achieving sustainable development goals. A thumbs up to the instructor for such an amazing, interactive and detailed insights about such an important topic. One of the thing which can be improved is the length of the videos. They shall be shortened. Thanks
Within a short amount of
time, this course provides so many useful
contents and insights from professionals. Personally, it had offered me so much knowledge and widened my
ideas about SDGs, helped me to think globally and locally, with lots of disciplines involved. This course is one of the best and hopefully will be useful for my current and
future study.
your teaching method is very impassive and streamlined in which the customer and a lot of other data you are one and the material you have collected is also very useful during this course and you have been very helpful to the perspective of other professors. I am glad to join The  SDG course in Coursera site. thank you professor ma'am for your heard work.
A brilliant course that gives great insight into the SDGs set forth by the United Nations Agenda 2030. Provides knowledge on the many happenings worldwide that urgently needs addressing as well as the methods and agreements presently implemented for the same. A well explained course for everyone interested in the field of sustainable development. Thanks!
I commend all who made this course accessible to many. The flow and format of the course was user-friendly and the content was just the right amount of information that it keeps the participants hooked and coming back for more. The information presented were up-to-date, extremely engaging, and so useful for learning professionals and policymakers.
As someone who has never fully delved into the SDGs and their study I believe this course to have really helped me become acquainted with their nature as well as interactions. I believe the topics that have been discussed over the past 3 weeks to be so actual that anybody who is slightly interested in making a difference should attend this course.
Such amazing and eye opening content. It is structured in such a good way and it is very easy to learn. Got to learn many new things from this. And I recommend this course to anyone who has little bit of interest on environment side and in general to all people because it is the need of hour to understand and do something about our planet.
The course was very helpful in offering a crisp understanding of SDGs and how we need to rebuild our world to sustain our environment. Also giving us the entire scenario with a single example made it even easier for us to understand how severe it is. The content of this course is apt for me to utilize in the future for my industry.
I had an interesting time attending the course. As a responible world citizen I consider this as my utmost responsibility to gain knowledge and work towards Climate change. This course is designed in a manner to give you a full picture. Now I understand about how economy affects gap and how economy plays a major role for SDGs.
I have heard a lot about the SDGs but never like this. This has given me so much insight into the workings of the SDGs and help me understand how to go about contributing/addressing the SDGs as they play out in my country and community. Thank you (Cousera team, Katherine Richards and all the other resource persons)  for this
The course is spot on an introduction to the SDG logic and provides very good insight and food for thought. Excelent videos and very well chosen readings. have found it accesible, interesting and inspirational to dig a bit more on pressing issues like inequality and climate change. Thank you very much and congratulations!
An excellent review of SDGs with thoughtful interviews by the world leaders to help the viewer gain a wider world perspective.  I was especially hopeful after lesson three as I thought of the business, community and personal contributions we can make outside our government policy to make a difference on a global level.

It is effective and less time consuming.In a very short time we can gather a lot from thos course.I think all should consider it if they really want to know about the synergy among SDGs . This course will help them to understand how our agriculture sector is adding to climate change. Appreciatedüëç
Ce cours est enrichissant car il permet de r√©fl√©chir en auto-critique √† des actions positives et √† une √©chelle mondiale d'imaginer d'autres solutions parfois anti-cl√©ricales. Le d√©roulement des s√©ances et vid√©os est fluide. Concernant les travaux individuels, il y a eu un souci dans la semaine 3.
My view is that this is a great way to help people understand SDGs in a more better way. Remember SDGs are anchored on very ambitious target and unless there is working together it may end up just another thing altogetherHow do I get certificate out of this ad I'm not able to buy for now please
It's an amazing and incredible course. I found what I was looking foto, and even beyond. This course, to me, is life changing. Is a tremendous tool for all the areas of the life, and feel stronger and more confident. This will help me to achieve all the goals that I have to my life. Thank you!
Wonderful course for having a comprehensive understanding of Sustainable Development. Specially involving specialists and researchers from different academic domains has provided an opportunity to look at the issues from trans-disciplinary perspective, and this is what has really enriched me.
Extremely interesting course for anyone interested in the topic. The focus on less discussed aspects such as agriculture or the role of the private sector gives interesting space for personal considerations. Strongly recommended to anyone who wants to acquire a basic knowledge of the SDGs.
I think it is a good option to get to understand the real problem we are creating to the environment, how SDG's are connected and what we can do to prevent it from getting worse. It made me think about adopting a new lifestyle and change many patterns we have that are harming the nature.
Its a great course to learn the basics about the reason of the Sustainable Development Goals. There is a lot of interesting capacity building ideas and knowledge, featuring speakers and experts from academia and other sectors on crucial topics related to the implementation of the SDGs.
Very relevant topics were covered, the structure and flow was easy to understand, very informative also. I now have a much better understanding of the topics and the effects and ramifications of the 17 SDG and what they mean to us, both in terms of society and business. Thank you

Really enjoyed this course with Kate. I especially liked the lectures and the interviews with a range of diverse experts which helped me gain a broader understanding of sustainable developments and the various interactions of the SDGs with other sectors and disciplines.
After this course I have gone thru change my thought process and make me realize how important it is to be part of SDG success. It is the battle or plan of survival for humankind. The materials are great and I think I have to invest more time on reading each materials.
This is a well structured course, it has given me the best understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals, and as a Development Studies PhD student, I fully subscribe to the SDGs and following closely on its progress and achievements especially in my country Kenya.
Lets get more people to access this course, especially young people in African (SSA) countries, the challenge this side is payment methodology,  you should come up with payment methodology say locally so that most people can access the course. It is so incredible!!!
