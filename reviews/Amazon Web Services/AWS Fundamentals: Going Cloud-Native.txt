This is not a "course" - it should be free content available to anyone interesting in AWS.   It is really a length sales pitch about why one should use AWS.   About the only thing you can actually learn is some basic AWS terminology if that would be new to you.
"Fundamentals"I stopped this course when they started setting up an EC2 instance because they skipped ahead like 5 steps and the response from the instructors was, "This isn't supposed to be a step-by-step" and then provided a link to Amazon's AWS Help pages. I would say if IAM is a requirement to setup servers in AWS, then setting up IAM should probably be part of the fundamentals course
Low quality/time spent ratio. Basically tt's a one big advertisement of AWS. And it wouldn't necessarily be a such problem if assessments would be open and examples shown during videos able to do by oneself. Unfortunately you can't submit your tests' answers without upgrading to paid version. Free tier account doesn't allow to do the same things as you can see in videos.
Extremely less content
worst curse ever
Relatively disappointing course. I was expecting more CLI examples and examples in the most recent version of the console. Lots of examples did not work out of the box and I had to muddle through settings of my own to fix them. I have a strong technical background and could find the appropriate settings; what about people who are really not interested in applications at all and just want to make their product cloud-native? Those people can be discouraged if they try to replicate an example on their own in a different tab and it doesn't work. Perhaps most worryingly, the entire specialization seems to not have any coding exercises. I fear that if I were to continue with this specialization, I would not get a full grasp of AWS services.
You need to let people use the system not just watch. This is less helpful than typical YouTube videos and needs to have some form of actual labs. It seems more like this was used to educate people on a potential cost saving platform vs hosting all services on premises. Not pleased, finished in a day though so didn't cost me a dime. Only makes me dislike large conglomerates like Amazon even more.  Step it up Jeff.
Quite useless course. It tries to give you VERY basic AWS overview and to achieve it they skip a lot of important terms and settings of computer networks. The only things this course gives you is familiarity with AWS abbreviations and their bloat web ui.  All course assessments are not about your understanding of clouds and networks, but more about how well did you remember specific advantage of AWS from video.
The lecturers encourage you to try configuring the server along with them but then they skip a lot of steps and don't provide the resources needed, they just mention a bunch of theory and concepts with no way to get hands-on experience. Very disappointed in the content of this course, wouldn't recommend to anyone interested on learning how to deploy on aws.
This course was not what I expected. In this course, I was expecting to create an application and host it on AWS with all configurations. But you did not even teach me how to deploy my web app on EC2.
EXTREMELY POOR. ONLY FANCY thing...but originally no help... Missed too much information.. Jumping from 1 step to 4th step. without even telling the steps in between.POOR COURSE and Extremely costly.
Explanations and demos are ok but there is too much watching with minimal to no interaction.
Very promotional and 'aws-goody-goody type'. Not what i wanted.
one of the instructor is like a robot.
no esta en espa√±ol
no use
Short, not very to the point. This course has to be taken by someone who really wants to know and learn about AWS and this course is not very helpful for learning about Cloud computing.This just tells about benefits of AWS and the service it provides.  Also, the content was less and very fundamental.
Seems like an ad for AWS
I agree with some other reviewers that this course is more of a promotional ad, and technically explains what we are doing with AWS services, etc. It takes you step by step via AWS account at a somewhat faster pace than I anticipated. It does not thoroughly explain how and why we are doing these steps, services, etc. I was hoping there was a glossary of terms, several terms are unexplained and dismissed, or even assumed we knew. Overall, disappointing course.
If you're completely new to IT, have never heard of provisioning servers in the cloud, and don't realize that scalability is a thing, this course is for you.If, on the other hand, you're bringing any knowledge to the table, don't expect to get much out of these commercials. They cover a fraction of the interesting points about a small number of AWS services. There are really no hands-on labs. You can't follow along, because the things they are showing won't work by default. Look elsewhere, unless you've never, ever done anything in IT before. That's how "fundamental" this is.
This course is aimed on the non technical person and gives only basic overview that feels like advertisement. If you are technical person and want to know how to use AWS in details you better look for some other coursesDuring the course I felt that the goal of the course is not to give me fundamentals but more like persuade me that I should buy and use AWS
A solid overview if you have never done anything with AWS before, but the level was too high, the examples far too thin on detail, and a complete lack of practice exercises made the course not overly useful. Not worth the price unfortunately.
The labs are useless as they do not work out the same in the real scenario. You get different errors and if you think discussion forums will help you out, you're wrong!
This is not a course to pay for. It's an AWS ad that teaches you basic jargon, and a very basic introduction to self-study.
Heavily focused on potential AWS service buyers. Not useful for people working on AWS.
I was expecting a more advanced and professional course.
Very basic course. Lot of demos are skipped
It is a very long ad.
In my personal opinion is a very expensive course for just an introduction, and the details to have at the end the example app on your account could be improved, on the bright side it gives a general overview of several services that probably you are going to use.
This is a very good introduction to AWS. However, For a 5 week course, I feel the amount of content in this course is fairly light. More could have been covered.
Much more shallow than I expected, it's just scratching the surface. The entire 5-week course can be completed during your morning coffee time.
It started of well but after the 1st week the lectures started to cover too much ground and I was not able to follow up with hands on examples. Especially after the 2nd week I was simply watching the videos without any incentive to try anything out myself.So I would suggest that the course has more hands-on examples that the students can actually try themselves. Otherwise, interest is lost and the course becomes a bit boring.Overall, the course doesn't have to cover too much ground as long as the students can follow through with hands-on examples and exercises/assignments etc.
would like to know caveats as wellalso, deep dive into setting up a vpc was too much, thought this was more of an overview course
Would be better if there was more practical elements to the course. Very jargon and acronym heavy.
We need practice assignments to practice the operations the lesson videos demonstrate.
Lab exercise would be helpful
This course provides a very broad overview of some of the services available through AWS. However, it is very basic and does not involve any hands-on activities. The course videos, though high in quality, are very short, and the only student assessments are a few short, easy quizzes. It looks like future courses in this specialization involve more hands-on activities, so I guess I'll take this course for what it is--a very basic introduction and broad overview.
Good course for starters. Early weeks give you a good understanding of general architecture and common services, but the course seems to skim over Security and Cost management considering these are the topics that are boring and need fun-to-watch content. In my Opinion the Lady trainer (Morgan)  can do a little improvement on content delivery.
This class provides a nice overview and a good way to get 'the big picture' for AWS.    I would have liked to have seen a few hands-on problems.   Given that this class as close to a marketing pitch as I have seen wrt Coursera courses,  this should have been audit-able with tests like the Jira class from Atlassian.
The course is very fundamental and looks more like their advertisement than actual learning. Though the instructors were good, there will very less demonstration of how things are setup. This course also lacked the side project to demonstrate what we learnt. I liked the aws serverless course more than this.
I did learn lots, but also felt like I'd paid to have AWS sell me their services. Does feel like a hard sell on some of the quiz questions, essentially regurgitating marketing material to make you an AWS loyalist. Excellent video content when actually teaching new concepts and not just listing services.
This course only gives a quick demonstration of aws and its services, if you are looking for to be good at hands-on, this is not the right course. This course doesn't emphasis on you doing by your hands. This course would serve as a best revision course for people who already have a decent idea on AWS
This course has a lower standard then what I've expected, perhaps due to the fact that I've just finished Andrew Ng's deeplearning specialisation prior to this... But that specialisation is what i really expect in a proper course.
You need to have some basic knowledge about websites and applications. Overall explanations are not that thorough but you will understand partially. Mainly for aspiring web and app developers.
Nice course, but too simple and too short. I would expect a weekly based course to take longer. Some items I could complete in 20 minutes. Gives you a nice overview of what AWS can do.
the lab video is very confusing. You can't really follow along because some steps are being already done and skipped on the video. The lecture videos are really good.
Good for the people having no theoretical and practical experience for clearing and getting familiarize with the native concepts but not covered topics in detailed
Course content and tutors are good. It would be better if more in depth explanations are done for the topics and possibly more hands-on practice and labs.
This course is made for beginners. No complaint about it because I just want to be familiar with AWS. Do not suggest this course to experts in this area.
Some of the videos does not provide clear and explicit answers on some of the quiz questions. Or the questions sometimes are too abstract.
Deft introduction to AWS services, but I would expect AWS to share this kind of marketing tour around their offer free of charge.
What would you like to see in future AWS courses on Coursera?More demos and hands-on labs. Good and funny lessons. Good quality.
Great teacher but when I go to find job, employer will ask show your skills and projects. This course has built zero of them.
This course gives a brief overview of AWS. I found it easy and useful, but it really looked like AWS advertisement
Its a great introduction to the concepts. Don't expect to pass any certification exam on this material alone.
But this course could be much great if more practical can be included for beginners it may be somewhat good
Bit simple, can be finished in 1 day if you have some previous experience with (other) Cloud providers
Too Basic. Not found something useful. Overall fine course. But needed code implementation too.2.8/5
Explanation could be much better. Most of times lectures seems that it going through prompter.
Good but if there was more of tasks and asked us to follow up the lectures and go along
It was very basic course, for beginners its the best to put the foot in the water!
This course is well designed for a Sales Presentation, not for a learning course.
I learned something new but it was too easy and felt more like PR stuff at times.
add project at the end.This would be helpful in practising the skills gained.
this course should be more detailed in a precise and understandable manner
Great for getting a tour of AWS services - not in-depth by any means.
not practical dont taught how to launch ec2 instance from scrratch
It's good but u can improve more easily way to learn about aws
Good starter for the cloud. Complete lack of labs / hands-on.
Bugs in Labs and not ideal order to follow the hands on Labs.
Good starting place to learn the ABCs of cloud computing.
Good information on AWS, but was mainly a Sales pitch!
Excellent Teaching with Medium level comunication
Excellent course, but a little short and simple.
it is fantastic all basic concept of services
Nice course for complete newbies to cloud
Could have been better elaborated
Need practise end to end labs
very easy, not much depth
Course is for beginners
Good One for Begineer.
covered less titles
COULD BE MORE GREAT
Just ABCD of AWS.
ok ! good !
Huge add
This course has good content but doesn't give you the example application to work with. I think that's an oversight. It does give you a decent overview of AWS though so it was still quite useful for me.
The course was informative and straight to the point for those with AWS background, however it was lacking of at least couple labs scenarios for EC2 and S3 (very simple and short to implement)
A little short and simple but good introduction. Very clear explanations of the "why" behind each service.
Great overview of main utilities and how they connect together. However, please note its feels more like a short executive summary, than actual end-to-end detailed example - this could be a plus or a minus, depending on what you're looking for. Unfortunately the examples are outdated, and furthermore they run on accounts that already had all kinds of pre-existing stuff, so if you want to try them out - you'll need to tweak a bit.
It's a great class with very friendly and helpful instructors. It's also very accessible to students of varying technical backgrounds. With that said, I do think it could be a little more challenging. But that's the only issue I take with the course, from which I still learned quite a few things. I definitely plan on taking follow-up courses from AWS.
It's a nice introduction course. Maybe a little easy and would be better with actual labs, as they called it. The instructors are really nice and explain everything really crearly so that was great. I also liked having a final quiz to review everything you learned so far but maybe it would be best to have different questions as the previous ones
A quality content that you can learn about aws and cloud computing if your a beginner. There is an introduction of what aws is but I also suggest the rookies to just learn just a quick overview of what cloud computing is before you start this course for a better understanding as well. Overall, this is an amazing fundamental course for aws.
This is very interesting and really good to understand about what AWS is and the services even for a beginner. I recommend this course for any beginner or anyone who wants to understand what AWS is. very well explained and very easy to understand, I could finish this course within 5 days max. This is that interesting.
The course and its tutor is best at their performance but only one lack i would like to submit about this course here is that like other courses such as IT fundamental, python, html 5, it  has not its practical assignment. Only videos and quiz is there. It provides knowledge but don't raise skill that much.
Sometimes you just want to see the lie of the land from 10,000 feet. That is what this course does - it introduces the main concepts that underpin the AWS architecture. If you want to set up anything yourself, you will still need to jump into the docs, but at least you will know your ELB from your ELF.
A great introduction into AWS. The follow along labs are hard to follow if you are completely new to AWS. I plan to get the fundamentals certificate and skip the cloud practitioner cert. I think after getting the fundamentals cert, I will be ready to study for the Solutions Architect Associate exam.
A good overview of the main components of AWS. If you do not know AWS at all this is a great introduction. It will not take you anything close to 5 weeks to complete though so dont be put off by that. It can be completed in probably 8 hours or less depending on how much documentation you read!
AWS Fundamentals course gave me a clear, high level understanding of AWS. Although advertised as an entry level one, some concepts explained in the course required further study. Good for people who need to discuss switching to cloud with real experts, i.e for managers and decision makers.
A Very Planned Course to explain in brief all the required dashboards and tools which can be used by anyone. The pace of the course/videos was amazing. If you cannot access an AWS Service due to financial issues, this video course can help you learn something without hands on experience !
Great intro course. Just one thing to point out... keep it slightly more serious, it¬¥s fun to see instructors making the course funny (Labs outfits) but in my opinion a bit too much.All the rest was just great... you have a great portfolio of products and i wish to dive deeper into it.
The course had a very high production value and excellent instructors. However, there were no labs or hands-on components. When compared to the Google courses offered on Coursera, I find that to be a major shortcoming. If there were labs, this would have been an easy 5-star rating.
This course gave a good knowledge about the AWS basics. Pros:The way in which they explains is very good, sounds simple and easy.Cons: The only thing which it lacks is the Labs. They should provide lab after each module so that the student can use the AWS free tier and do hands on.
Thank you so much for this nice course .Very good course, well prepared .Great and experienced instructors who can really take you into the AWS services world easily .A fast and easy course to know about AWS if you know nothing about it at all in a very short period of time .
This course gave a nice overview of the fundamentals of AWS. I would have liked a bit of hands-on exercises as well, but hopefully that will come in the following courses. As it is now, you are responsible for experimenting with the tools yourself when following this course.
Really good course, but I missed Hands-on lab activities and some slide deck to summarize and structure logic/concepts. I understand the course is beginner level, but I think the course is so "highlevel" (superficial). Maybe the reading should provide some more deep article.
Good introduction for those just getting started with AWS. Presentations provide just enough information to get the mile-high view without being overwhelming. Additional courses that deep-dive into specific services as well as certification would be perfect compliment.
Course gave the introduction about what AWS actually offers and introduce many new topics with the detailed explaination and how to work on this topics were clearly taught.Thankyou Amazon Web Services & Amazon.com for this wonderful fundamental course.
This is course is best for who knows the AWS little bit already because some concepts should be talk more in lectures otherwise it is the best. I found that modules must be increased these are not sufficient for the students to understand from basics.
Very professional course from amazon to cover lots of basic stuff in easy environment, quizs are simple but it captures the core concepts to unstandand. It will be good to extend each module to have more hands-on exercise like dedicated training zone.
I would have been happier if, Amazon provided us with educational accounts. In my case, I was not willing to add my credit/debit card details and due to this reason, I felt this course was more theoretical than I had expected it to be.
One Must take this course to understand how AWS services are helpful to customers in scaling and managing them on the cloud, also this course is helpful to get better exposure on AWS components which are highly usable on the market.
Should have included a bit more of hands-on experiments. Example: Instructors have shown the corporate directory application, but it was preinstalled in the VM. Should have shown how to deploy that application in the EC2.
This course is great if you want to learn AWS services specifically on a beginner level. I missed some comparison to other cloud providers, some practice exercise (not only quizzes) but overall, it is a nice overview.
It's was a nice journey n getting to know about AWS was pretty fascinating but it would be superb if we could try it same time while learning and get hands on experience on AWS. Overall it was good to learn about AWS
The videos are well made and all, but they need to update the content, I couldn't make the excercises just like in the videos because the options presented in the videos were not available in the current platform.
Um curso excelente, com profissionais extremamente qualificados. S√≥ n√£o dou nota m√°xima, porque a forma como ordenam os videos e abordam os conte√∫dos pode confundir, j√° que n√£o est√° em uma ordem muito did√°tica.
They don't provide you access to the materials to lab excercises like the web app and expect us to follow along.It somewhat provides insight to what AWS is capable of.Blaine. one of the instructor is hilarious!
Good introduction to services and tools offered by AWS such as Cloud Computing, AWS Security, Cloud Storage, cloud networking, and Cloud Computing. Simple presentation makes it easy to build your own systems
Good course for beginners. Teachers kept is fun and engaging. Great notes come with the course. Could have been a bit more difficult as it seemed very easy and on the edge of a sales speech. Still very good!
this course made my day!!...covering from basic concepts of aws fundamentals to network and security,The instructors were engaged in a  best possible way...Loved this course by the way!..HAPPY..LEARNING!
This course was a good place to start learning about AWS. I reduced a star because of lack of giving enough big picture and definitions. Sometimes it was not clear. Overall, I recommend this course.
got a better insight of AWS , how it could make our work easy, but if  little more technical knowledge from Instructor Morgan side would have been given , then are experience would have been better.
AWS Training offers flexible digital training options for your learning needs. Choose what to learn, and when and how to learn it. With 24/7 access, you can move quickly from learning to doing.
Great course for the beginners but needs a bit of hands on part, apart this it has great trainers and a very good visualisation of how the services are working in real time. Highly recommended.
I have been constantly following the discussion board. There are no instructors to reply to your inquiries. Nonetheless, this course is very useful first step towards AWS certifications.
This course is pretty good and gives a pretty neat introduction to AWS. Concise and fun and covers the basics pretty well. I would recommend to any beginner who wants to start with AWS.
This course gives me a basic and comprehensive introduction of AWS products. Those drawings are my favorite because they are really helpful for my understanding of the AWS structure.
No pude hacer algunos laboratorios porque ya requer√≠an algo de pre configuraciones que no tenia y no ven√≠an explicadas, fuera de eso es bastante bueno para comenzar a entender AWS.
Nice overview of AWS! Liked the block diagrams - they really helped me understand how the various pieces connect. I'd like to see a flowchart or checklist to help me get started.
Wonderful course by AWS to start learning of basic fundamental to start actual free tier experience to setup own AWS cloud :) Love to learn more on AWS other courses. Keep it up!
Very well done, a bit more hands on with labs would make it even better. The instructors made the course enjoyable and interesting. Morgan's lab helped me deploy a live website.
Interesante curso para conocer los productos de Amazon AWS e iniciarse. Las pr√°cticas no funcionan tal y como te dicen en los v√≠deos si tienes una cuenta gratuita de Amazon.
This course was very easy to learn and made a clear path to achieve the desired role. while the instructor Morgan and Blaine did very good effort in teaching the technology
Great course for any who needs to understand how the AWS works and also get some hands on trainig that can give some basic knowledge of deploying applications on cloud.
Found the course helpful for those who are new to AWS. For those with more experience, this course was a high level overview and does not go into great in-depth details
The course was pretty good, especially the visuals to walk beginners through the material.  I would have liked some practice study guides to help prepare for the CCP.
If you plan to pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, this course is mandatory. However, you might need some other resources to increase your overall score.
This course is very useful for people who are new to cloud computing. Instructors made it easy to understand the underlying features of every service they taught.
A very good fundamentals covers in this aws course, recommends for all the beginner level nerds. it gives me more confident to purse my future career in the AWS.
This course has got some awesome content even for cloud beginners. It would be a 5 star course if they had provided temporary credentials for hands-on learning.
It was a great to learn new things which earlier I never heard of, grateful to the content creators who created such a systematic and understandable content...
The instructors gives insight of different AWS services with practical demos and illustrations that helps students  to understand the new terminologies easily.
Very good in terms of insights to AWS working, could be more detailed and more questions created, A better graphical representation of facts can also be done.
It is a good course to understand some, but important AWS services. Do not expect a lot of practical exercises. For me, it was more like a theoretical course.
well done course videos, etc.  However, some of the labs were not up to date.  Questions were asked in the forums, but no one from AWS or Coursera answered.
In this course, i have found that in test section when i choose true it automatically shifted to false n jumping of ticked answer occasionally occurs.
Would have been better if there were practical labs so that registered candidates can practice and they would have been graded over their assessment
very nice course for beginners and this course covers all basic concepts. A special thanks to all the trainers they perform there best .Thanks‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòé
Should get more deeper with topics so that people can get more knowledge apart from what they have with more real life problems and hands-on labs.
Overall course is designed in constructive  manner. Very helpful for people who are new to cloud. Thanks for all your efforts to make this course.
I can't apply for a certificate (unployee/no money) but I audited the course...my only complain is that in audit you can't check your knowledge.
Hands on lab on essential basic services like  amazon lightsail and more info like how would one migrate already existing site into amazon cloud
Content is good. But I was expecting more details from the course. Found the course content quite brief. Can be easily completed within 2 weeks.
this is course is most effective when you know the basics of cloud computing.  if you want an overview world's largest cloud service(AWS).
This course is very good for beginner to learn about AWS and Instructor of this course is very good.I like most labs to learn practically
Concepts and Study material is good. Course design and Trainers are good at delivering it. What is missing is Hands on Practice sessions.
it gives me a great introduction about what is aws and how does it works. Specially how to deploy a simple application into production
Morgan is pretty as well a good instructor,and Blaine created a funny interactive environment , a very helpful course for beginner!!!
it's best courses for cloude concept. This courses help me to develop my cloude knowledge .Thanks coursera for lunching this course.
This is a very good introduction but it should be mentioned that there is a requirement of understanding basic networking concepts
Exceptional Introduction to AWS Cloud.  Well presented, reasonable and logical quizes/assessments, time and material management.
Good Course for beginners who want to get introduced amazon Web services , their compute platform ,storage and security offered.
I got from this course a lot.  Security and cost management, EC2 instance, AWS budget topics learned from this course. Thank you
I enjoyed a lot when I am learning this course. I am confident that the applications I learned, are very much useful in future.
You get better understanding after basic terminologies of week 1 and week 2 , after that it is easier to understand concepts.
Good content and lectures to give a basic understanding of AWS, but it was not really possible to follow along with the labs.
focused on some fundamental AWS services in the areas of compute, networking, storage, databases, monitoring, and scaling.
Good beginner course on understanding fundemental terms of AWS. It would be nice to understand other services available.
Good course for starting AWS Cloud Computing. Recommended. Please if possible include hands-on lab for practice. Thanks
To go with the fundamentals and basic services of aws this course will give you all material to deploy your app on aws.
It will be more useful, if the topic is covered little more deep with more example.Hope coursera will include the same.
it was nice to take this course and i am happy to learn about AWS and looking forward to next and new things about AWS
I found this course very useful . I am satisfied with my progress in this course and I guess my expectations were met.
It's a basic course that introduce you to the knowledge of the core AWS services, its characteristics and use cases.
gave basic funderstanding of Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 and other services.It's quite helpfull for the begineers kudos!!!
I liked that many of AWS services/products were covered. A hands-on labs would be a great complement to the course.
Pretty dope teaching by both the instructors ,Blaine and Morgan. Truly enjoyed it. More concepts can be included.
Providing Sample application code for download or deploying the application steps would have been beneficial here
I think it's a good starting point. A little bit too superficial, which is why I give four instead of five stars.
Good introduction to the platform.Only downside is practical have to done by creating AWS account for  your self
Cela donne un bon aper√ßu des possibilit√©s offertes par AWS pour lancer des produits et services dans le cloud
O curso √© bom para um n√≠vel introdut√≥rio, mas poderia incluir atividades hands-on na se√ß√£o de exerc√≠cios.
It's good basic overview of AWS, but the fact that you can't follow along with demo app is frustrating.
Easy to understand since it was fundamental course. But, it will be great if AWS add some hands-on labs
A very introductory course. I would recommend anyone to take a hands-on project with AWS to learn more.
This is more of an overview of the services and brief intro on how one might start to configure them.
Good breath but depth is missing for some configuration details. Overall got a decent view about AWS.
The instructors were knowledgeable and presented the information in a clear, understandable fashion.
Provide some hands on,then it will be more helpful.Very useful all the material, basics are cleared.
A well and good course. A lot of things yet to uncover. But at the end learnt a lot from the course.
Nice course to learn fundamentals of AWS.Not sufficient to create an AWS system as you follow along.
Would have liked more hands-on/lab sessions, especially on creating security group, adding rules etc
Overall good course I recommend this course all who are or who willing to start a career in AWS.
not bad for someone who want just to know what is AWS, it give just shallow Idea idea about AWS
I get a basic knowledge about networking and cloud computing that is useful in my current role
Great introduction to AWS, but I would have liked more content for the cloud security section.
Best for the Beginner who is new to AWS cloud, To the point basic concept to understand topics
Thanks for having given an opportunity to learn this course to know more about AWS on Cloud.
Wonderful intro about aws services but still i would recommend people to get a hands on exp.
Overall, the course is well organized and easy to follow. However some videos are too long.
I did not have the opportunity for hands-on during the session. Has to be done separately.
This is a very useful and enjoyable course. The only problem is it not have hand on labs.
Good Course that gives us overview of AWS offerings and reasons to opt for its services.
I needed  detail application of all the sevices .but overall I enjoyed the whole course.
Very Good  Course  on AWS for take  a start and move further on AWS Advance level Course
Good for learning fundamental about AWS. After completing you can find what to do next.
Very good introduction to the AWS fundamentals, could have been a little more hands on.
Good course to learn basics. Would be great to have some practical exercises in there
Ser√¨a excelente si lo traducen......creo que lograrian mayor acogda en latinoamerica
The course is good for beginners,but still miss a lot of hand-on experience required
The fundamental knowledge of AWS services. I get the starting point for next level.
This course is very good for knowledge . It help you to know about AWS fundamental.
It would be nice if there were practical exercises to follow up along the course.
The course is really very good & the way Blain has explained was up to the mark .
Good all round 1st course in AWS tech. Would be improved with more hands on labs.
Great videos and teachers. Would be good to include some hands-on experience.
Lightweight course, a pretty good introduction to AWS products and the cloud.
great intro course,  but needs to offer links to source code for Web App used
I basically very much like the course. It brings my fascination about amazon.
From a layman perspective: this is the ideal place to get an idea about AWS.
This course help me look forward and make me more voracious about knowledge.
Gives overview but no hands on exercises. WOuld like some hands on setup etc
Easy to follow and well explained course about Amazon Cloud and its services
Very good and informative course, For fundamentals this one is perfect one.
its a course where we can can have detailed explanation and  basics of aws
Course is very good enough to get the basic introduction about Amazon AWS.
Blen is good teacher, the way is explained the Networking is simply superb
This course is really helpful for me and i  learnt lot of from this course
Helps to have a broad vision of aws. First step for future certification.
very good course, it's very good for a rookie to get into aws and explore
I'd take another course using this group of instructors. Very personable.
Content is well organized.  The videos are clear and easy to understand.
Perfect for beginners .It covers all primary services tutorials of AWS .
Great course for complete beginners but the pace can be more quickened.
A good intro to what AWS platform can offer in terms of basic services.
Really good course for a beginner in AWS. Very well put in the videos.
Wow, It Will make you learn the full fundamentals of AWS. Loved !!!!
About this AWS ,I got lots of  knowledge.I felt it very intresting.
It was an amazing experience to be taught from the amazing trainer.
The course was very useful to understand the basics of AWS Services
Easy to understand. Thanks for the crispy and clean presentation.
Very good course, I'd have included a few more Labs and exercises
Its an amazing course to begin your journey of cloud computing !
Great course,but some hands on exercises would have been helpful
Very important course for whom is introducing in clouds concepts
A little easier than I expected, but good content for beginners.

This course helped me to gain the core fundamentals of the aws and how the things work in cloud , apart from these the course was enriched with the ec2 , rds , s3 , autoscalling and much more , the content delivery was so good and nurishing,,,,,.once again thanks AWS and COURSERA..
Good content and good detail for an overview course. There is enough information in theory and in practical configuration examples to provide a user with a real starting point.
Very good information about AWS services. however, it looks like a promotional program somehow. I think aws should add some lessons about comparing with other competitive services for a broader view.
informative, well defined, very easy to understand, i would like to thank Amazon for designing this course really enhance the knowledge of the concerns. Thank you Fahar
Worth the time and efforts. Easy to follow and learn! helped me (i have almost zero IT background) a lot in my career when dealing with Customers who need AWS services.
Very well explained lectures and live demo gives clear understanding of few of the services provided by AWS. Perfect course to get started with AWS.
easy to understand and very logically put together
Extremely Informative, Best course and module to start with AWS for absolute Freshers and new to AWS. Complete Package of AWS fundamentals an Absolute TO-GO course for people with high inclination and high interests towards Amazon Web Services.
Straight forward and lots of new things to learn. I love Blaine;s relaxed style of teaching. It eases my tension as I am new to IT and AWS. Blaine makes me feel relaxed and as such sustained my interests to the end.
This was wonderful course, It has cleared my doubts about cloud infrastructure and computing. I am looking forward for more courses offered by AWS and Coursera . Thanks to Courera,AWS Team and Trainers.
It is a very interesting course and very useful to me.I recommend everyone to do this course.You can't get a better course than this.Thanks Allen,Morgan and Blaine for providing a very good lessons.
Great class with well delivered materials to get you up to speed quickly on the basics of AWS.  Enjoyed it as a refresher and a way to cross some T's and dot a few I's before digging deeper.
Highly recommended course...my first course here...been an amazing journey :DContent is on point and very handy...easy to understand...no prior knowledge required.Definitely Recommended!!
I learned beyond the basics of AWS, Cloud. I appreciate the fluidity of the instructors and their sens of humor when presenting the course, it is marvelous and unique :) Thanks Team :)
Examples are good but wanted to do hands on and the file was not available
Excellent introduction to AWS
I have done a little over one week portion of this course and I'm already loving it! I was a little worried that this course would be tooooo basic, which is in a way but in a great way! TBH most of the materials are available in detail on the AWS website and for free. But AWS training department did a great job on organizing the info and delivering it in the simplest and easiest way possible, especially for someone who doesn't come from any technical background. I hope this course could kick-start my interest in AWS and hopefully I can keep that interest all the way to the next step of this AWS certification roadmap.
Excellent course for beginner technical professionals as well as for non-technical or new people coming into the cloud computing field. The course is well-structured and provides excellent knowledge. Since it is for beginners, assignments were not expected otherwise some assignments should have been there to gain more confidence. However, there are quizzes for each major topic. A must course for anyone who is entering into cloud computing specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The course provided an excellent overview of concepts such as advantages of going to cloud, regions, Availability Zones, Creating an EC2 instance, Attaching sample application to the instance, VPC, RDS, DynamoDB databases, Storage on Cloud, monitoring and scaling, security and cost management. The lectures had enough demonstration to reinforce the idea. The reading material provided adequate information for learning. Strongly recommended for beginners who are interested in AWS
I really loved this course. I would like to have more courses, training from AWS. I enjoyed the demos from Morgan and Deep explanations from Blaine. Really that was awesome. Not forgetting our friend the lezard, It's the coolest example that I have ever had in my learning path. Thanks of course to Allen for giving this learning possibility. I will be really pleased to see more courses from you. Thanks a lot :-)
I take IT/Computer Science courses regularly for work and for my own education. This is by far one of the best courses I took in the last couple of years. Well explained, well structured, with example. Perfect!         It also allowed me to pass AWS Practitioner exam with 900 score.  Highly recommend.  BTW, I took Practitioner exam preparation class at AWS site and it was boring a as hell.
Good Day

Excellent introductory course. I like that the most important aspects of the AWS were explained in the videos. If you want more information, they placed the links of each service after each service presentation.Very easy to understand the principles, english is perfectly spoken for non-native english speakers, the course laboratories really helps you understand all the terms.
According to me it is best course for whom are familiar or not familiar to cloud computing. One who don't know cloud computing Blaine Sundrud's type of teaching is very well. He/she can learn basic concept of cloud computing. Morgan Willis have performed all practical with great explanation. Course is started from scratch of AWS to fundamentals of AWS. Really, great course.
Excellent course to understand fundamentals of AWS. The way instructors presented the course material is very easy to understand and concise in nature. Apart from that, reading material and additional resources certainly help to gain better understanding of topics presented in the course. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about AWS.
This was one of the best courses that I have taken on Coursera. This course has really effective and useful content we need to know about AWS. Although it doesn't have hands-on-session still in the video series they have covered almost all the things. They have covered many AWS services with very less time, yet in an effective way. I have really enjoyed the course!!
I would recommend you to take this course if you are interested in cloud computing through AWS. This course teaches you the basics of AWS and its basic features. If you want to involved in this course very well then you must have some prior knowledge of Networking. You can attain the basic knowledge of Networking through "The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking".
This course helped me to gain the core fundamentals of the aws and how the things work in cloud , apart from these the course was enriched with the ec2 , rds , s3 , auto scalling and much more. I learned beyond the basics of AWS, Cloud. I appreciate the fluidity of the instructors and their sens of humor when presenting the course, it is marvelous and unique :)
Great overview for those curious about AWS.  I have a good deal of experience in virtualization and private DC's and it was good to see how AWS removes the "heavy lifting", at a cost of course.  But not having to worry about scalability is immense.  Certainly provided food for though as we look to launch other SaaS applications.
Excellent course. The lectures are concise and to the point. There's visual diagrams to help you understand the concepts better. All AWS services discussed are properly introduced first and you're guided through each step so you don't even have to know what that service does or even what AWS is before taking the course.
I would really like to say that you have got amazing trainers! Blaine, Sir I would really like to say that the way you explain things, it makes everything look so interesting and makes me wanna know and learn more! Morgan, Ma'am the labs and content that you deliver are really apt and precise! I really loved that!
Excellent delivery from all the instructors. They demonstrated high level of understanding of the course materials to bring a beginner like me to speed. I do not have IT background but taking this course I have develop strong appetite for more of AWS training courses. I highly recommend this course for starters.
Loved the course with smooth teaching by the tutors!  Since I always love learning, this made me fall in love with AWS as a service and idea! Kudos to creators!! A special mention to Blaine and his quirky ways of teaching - just awesome! Looking forward to do more courses and gain more knowledge in this series!
It's very good course with a perfect instructors that you are going to enjoy the course very much, the problem that i see is for me as a business administration student, the applied cases needs some kind of IT information which aren't my speciality  , but the rest of the course content is very useful
Really loved this course, thank you to the instructors that didn't make this course boring. I hope that you'll make some more AWS video trainings as you're helping IT pros and students all around the world to be skilled and equip them with the latest AWS and up to date in demand skills .
I really liked this course. It was awesome to me from every perspective. As a beginner, I learned fundamentals about AWS from this course. Thanks to AWS for creating a nice course like this one & also thanks to Coursera for giving us this nice platform to find courses like this useful.
Very good work amazon team. Morgan and blain have very good knowledge about what they are teaching. I guess that's why they are teaching. But anyway, Thank you for a wonderful course. If you wanna learn about the fundamentals with comedy then this is the course you're looking for.
My first experience with Coursea. It was indeed the best online tutorial i have ever seen. The teachers defenietly has an intention to keep their students attentive .  Even though  less concepts are there when compared to some other courses, it was worth the money and time!!
An amazing video series for beginners who want to start with AWS cloud and have an understanding of it. A must recommended tutorial for beginners and a suggestion to the training team, it would be really good if you can add some good real world examples to the course.
If you're a person looking forward to getting introduced to the main services provided by AWS. This course does an amazing job to help you do that. It gives the students a proper foundation in case they want to work and utilize the tools in their careers and projects.
Morgan, Blaine and Allen are the highlighted persons in this course who grabbed the attention and created interest in learning the course effectively. The course is very useful to work on AWS. I would surely recommend this course to my friends. Thanks to the team
I wish if the test could also be available for the users who cant pay.at least this gives us an opportunity to know how much could we understand and learn.of course this will have positive and negative sides both, but this will get more people to buy the course.
Beginner course with lot of basic concepts about AWS ranging from Infrastructure, Regions, Availabilty zones, Compute, Storage, Networking and Security, Monitoring and Scaling and Responsibility and Cost. Worth to take, if you are planing to get into the cloud.
AWS Fundamentals has helped me understand the different Cloud-based terminologies, how Amazon's Virtual private clouds work, and how we can use Auto-scaling to balance the loads and keep eye on cost and it's management. Instructors were also super cool :)
I highly recommend this course for AWS beginners to understand the cloud fundamentals and kick-start their cloud journey. I want to say thanks to the trainers - Allen, Morgan and Blaine for their excellent teaching methods which makes it more interesting!
This course is good but not that much exciting because it deals with all the theory part instead that was also interesting some what and eventually i have got some basic knowledge on AWS any person can learn this concept. For me this concept was too easy.
really enjoyed learning here , all the 3 faculties are best that they made very easy such complex concepts , the quiz helped alot in tracking myself and the lab part was superb..going to enroll next course in this series....i want to thanks the faulties.
This course very very useful to have prior knowledge about AWS and its most-used services. The mentors are so amazing, they have explained so lively and interactive hats-off. I loved the way they gave a real-life example of how the services can be used.
