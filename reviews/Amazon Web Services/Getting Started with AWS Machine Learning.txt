I'm using Coursera for more than 2 years and this is my first bad experience with a Cousera's course. This course seems just like an extended advertisement for AWS. This course neither contains any practical exercise for students to try on AWS nor any strong technical details about ML.
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you're not already a machine learning expert!This course only shows you how to use different Amazon Web Service applications. It will not teach you anything about the basics of machine learning. This is what I thought by the way...
Very sloppy. Typos in the slides, cases of duplicate videos appearing in the same week, and quizzes where none of the answer choices are correct. I've come to expect better from Coursera. This was a huge disappointment.
Poorly prepared course. The quizzes ask only one or two questions. The workload is not divided properly. Some weeks have hours long videos and some has a few minute ones. It seems like an intern has combined the videos from AWS library to generate some traffic on Coursera. There are only demos of the tool and no hands-on labs like the ones Google offers. You are much better off seeing the videos on AWS's portal.
The same content presented over and over again. Most trainers were just reading a text like a robot. In overall, it was disappointing.
Is more of a marketing ad than an actual course
This course is basically an AWS commercial.
what shit
no labs.
The content video is repetitive and it does not provide a deep understanding of machine learning. The major drawback is that there is no practical part of this course. To master AWS machine learning, I think exercising a machine learning project using AWS machine learning would be the best. However, that is not provided in the course. My verdict is that do consider again before taking this course or you will waste a lot of your time since most of the video contents are marketing contents by Amazon.
if you are stating that it is introductory course for begineer and starting with ml then you are fooling world.You are just trying to showcase excellence of how smart amazon is which is not bad way,but it feels like you are advertising amazon product to consumer.strongly dissappointed  by course curriculam.
I would have expected Amazon to actually provide us with some hands-on experience. To tell you the truth, I've learned nothing by completing this course. Thank god I didn't have to pay for this, otherwise I'd be really pissed off.
This is basically a course to show off Amazon's Machine Learning tools from Amazon Web Services. This would be more useful to businesses than the average person, which is the reason for the one-star rating.
No exercises (I've learned more from hands-on practice at my job).This course is just a bunch of random youtube videos put together, just AWS ads.Sorry
Very boring material, difficult to understand sometimes. Tests were not well-tailored to the actual content of the lesson.
Its just introductory course of the services available on AWS. I was expecting a more knowledge about machine learning
An advertisement for Amazon's services masquerading as a course. It's criminal that people have to pay for this.
The course isn't introductory at all. It requires a lot of prior understanding of Machine Learning algorithms.
Nothing to learn here. Just corporate videos trying to sell you to the Amazon Web Services.
Very heavy marketing (way more than expected) with negligible knowledge about any actual ML
Got this course for free but I definitely wouldn't pay to watch a 5 week ad from Amazon
NO IN-DEPTH TUTORIAL. JUST OVERVIEW OF AWS PRODUCTS EXCEPT FOR SAGEMAKER.
toooooooooooooooo boring instructors and boring way of teaching
videos were too lengthy and jumped around concepts
It was all about promoting Amazon's  ML products
Only advertisements for AWS.Total waste of money
too much video, not enough training on the job
This is 90% advertisement for AWS SageMaker
It is only theory based.
Amazon advertisement
Publicity stunt
no hands on
This course is a compilation of unstructured content that has been taken from the actual AWS certification programs. Most of the videos have repetitive content. The initial week includes content regarding the theoretical aspect of machine learning, which in general is adequate. In week 2,3,4, Amazon advertises their services and persistently tell you that why even bother learning about machine learning. The last week has some videos that are very lengthy which jump from 10 to 100 in terms of theoretical and practical knowledge, thus making a huge gap in the learners learning. This course tends to fail in recognising their target audience. Other cons: IMO purchasing this course is of no use. The course, for the least, could have provided labs for specific modules to explore the platform and to better understand the concepts taught step by step. Moreover, I am extremely disappointed from Coursera for providing such courses. Courses as such, in my opinion, are becoming a new medium to advertise your brand instead of providing insightful knowledge.
1). The coursework has very inconsistent difficulty/pre-qualification level requirements: it's not clear if it's aimed at total beginners or at data researchers who already have grasp on main concepts. One block/session would be totally understandable for a layman, another would look like you need an advance stat/math degree to comprehend it. One would introduce AWS ML functionality step-by-step, in a totally logical fashion, another would gallop straight into a maze of code, functions and executables that DEFINITELY require some previous experience with ML tools. If this is the course for people who are NOT professionals in BigData and ML and who want to learn the possibilities of AWS tools, then it's too difficult. If this is a course for ML professionals of some intermediate level, then parts of it probably look silly/simplistic to them.2). The course is obviously a self-promotion for AWS and Amazon (which is fine) - but sometimes it gets into the way of learning. Example (and a suggestion, really): Amazon clearly wanted to make a statement about their "commitment to diversity" by having almost every separate segment led by an employee of different ethnicity. Commendable? In a promo ad - yes, in a serious training course? Not so much: the problem is that all those people are speaking with different accents (some are worse than others). This actually makes it rather difficult to concentrate on the material delivered (especially because of the very uneven level of complexity, as I mentioned above). Don't get me wrong: I speak with an accent myself, so it's not about separating "proper" English from 'improper" English (and I'm absolutely certain ALL of the presenters are professionals in their field) - it's just an objective acoustic "layering" that makes you concentrate at times not at understanding the CONTENT, but actually at understanding the SPEAKER.
I was expecting more of a "How to" Machine learning, but this course was 95% "What is" Machine Learning. More Precisely, it was all about what Amazon Web Services could offer. In hindsight, This seems to be more of an advertisement for AWS than it is a course teaching machine learning. Every video was of a different person, thus it felt like I was watching salesrep after salesrep telling me what their products could do. Assessments were merely MCQs of what the salesrep was saying, akin to testing whether we are listening properly to the sales pitch or not, with a couple of questions asked when they are not even covered in the aforementioned advertisements. Typo error/erratas was also present in the one formula that was told to us in one of the video which was needed for an assessment afterwards. In all, if you are interested in what AWS is as a product, this course is for you. If u want to learn or get started with machine learning, perhaps try looking somewhere else to jumpstart
This course starts out more like an infomercial than a course. It is very focused on the AWS platform (as it should be), but especially the first week on "Introduction to ML" talks mostly about how great AWS is without usable information (Examples are always: this company had that problem, we applied this part of AWS and it worked really well). I first noticed the lack of detailed ML content, when the same NN graph about weights and biases was used three times in a reordered form as a centre piece of three different videos, as if the videos weren't coordinated.If you purely want to learn the functionalities of the AWS platform, this is the course for you. If you want to also learn about ML, I would suggest visiting a different course.
I enjoyed watching the lectures and learning about the features of AWS within the course context. However, I think the course was lacking an important aspect of learning; hands-on experience. If you can provide modules where people taking the course can follow along on AWS that will significantly boost the learning experience. That said, earning a certificate for the course was very easy. For the certificate to have a credibility, I believe the quizzes should be more challenging and passing them by just guess-work needs to be eliminated by asking different questions on each attempt. I enrolled for this course using a Coursera promotion and I haven't paid anything for the certificate. I would feel terribly bad if I paid for it.
This is just an advertisement, not a course. The narrative "This course will teach you how to get started with AWS Machine Learning" is completely wrong as the course just shows features available in AWS and very short examples. The course is chaotic. It not understandable why to get the certificate I need to pay money. The value of this certificate probably is very low (0).
If you want to learn algorithms or coding, its not the one, this course helps you know what kind of possibilities AWS has, and I think its an advertisement course, so at the end, you know what they have.This course doesn't even have some labs that you could try some of AWS Possibilities, "you'll know what they have in AWS," and that's all for five weeks!
There seemed to be wide variation in the level of technical detail in the various segments covered by different instructors.   The course tended to focus too much on image/video recognition rather than text analysis.   The 3 question quizzes did not offer a good cross-section of the material covered, the quizzes should include at least 10 questions.
The quality and delivery of this course is not what I expected from AWS. This course almost seems like cut and paste of several different training materials into one course and published on Coursera. AWS can do better if they expect people to adopt their tools and platforms, which it seems the intent of the course is.
This course is an overview of the services Amazon provides for running machine learning in the cloud. It does not do much to teach you about how the algorithms work, it is only high level. There is no hands-on assignments to help learning, only simple quizzes.
I felt like this course is designed for ML expert. It focused to much on using AWS ML services but lack of lab or sandboxes where we could follow along. Besides, this course felt a lot more like an advertisement of Amazon services.
Basically a giant advert for Amazon services (maybe unsurprisingly); would have been better if it provided rough cost estimates for the case studied provided. On the plus side, I feel I understand amazon's offerings better.
I feel this course is a mash up from many AWS courses, which have little to no continuity whatsoever. Instructors feel very robotic, and reading the documentation for AWS might be even better than taking this course.
This was more an advertisement for AWS services rather than a proper course. In some way interesting but I was expecting to learn more about machine learning and work on some projects at least.
The title of this course should be "Learn how to sell AWS portfolio". Do not buy this course if you're into practical demonstrations of want to test your skills.
Though some videos are very useful but you can't get the most out of this course if you don't have an AWS web account to practice lectures which is NOT FREE.
A namesake course with videos put together from all over. There is no hands-on experience for us to train on. My first worst experience on Coursera till date
This course felt more like AWS advertising the product to prospective data scientist/developers than the content to actually get started on ML using AWS
Should focus more about core machine learning algorithm and concepts of AWS servicesAnd more MCQ should be there for better screening
Il corso ha poco di Introduttivo: nei termini e negli approcci è molto avanzato. Ritengo che manchi tutta la parte di laboratorio.
first couple videos are ok, everything week 3 on is only useful if you plan on using Amazon's own solutions.  no hands on work.
A lot of overlap between the videos and it is not possible to practice on AWS platform directly within the course
This is a very introductory course where some of the modules were just taken from other courses. Not so good.
Its great but the lack of hands-on makes it hard to grasp the concepts taught in the course.
this seems to be a way for amazon to sell its ML services rather than teachinng it
should allow students to have hand-on experience in the use of Amazon sagemaker
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you're not already a machine learning expert!
Assignments should be added, just quizzes were not enough
Hard to understand for beginners.
more advertising than knowledge
Only promoting amazon tools
The starting 2 weeks were informative and then it seemed like an amazon commercial.
Who is this course for: People with basic ML knowledge and decently good at using APIs with Python.What can you do after this course: Be conversant in chaining AWS services to put ML theory knowledge into practical applications. Brainstorm and deploy an AI-powered feature/product for your business/project.Comments: Good overview of AWS products. ML pipeline and architecture shared is useful as a reference. This course should be much cheaper as it is a curated list of existing AWS training videos with no additional benefits like labs or coupons for hands-on learning.
A fair start to an overview of machine learning and aws services with hands-on exercise. There is lot of space for improvements on course and quiz contents (Some videos and quiz options are duplicated). Rather than an end quiz, few quizzes in between the long videos would ab better. A hands-on project for completion assessment can also be included. Recommendation rating for healthcare professionals (myself being one): 2.8/5 (where 0= never recommend , 5= highly recommend)
This course is too focused in how to implement machine learning for business using AWS products, it can be disappointing for data scientists since they show the use of AWS tools skipping over a lot of machine learning fundamentals. Additionally, there is no code assignments and the quizzes are about telling what AWS tool is the best choice for different business problems.I learned interesting things and tools in this course, but because I have prior knowledge of data science and machine learning. Additionally I spent some time doing my own tests on AWS Sagemaker by myself.
This is an okay introduction to ML and AI, but the overall course content could have been consolidated. As it is right no it feels like a collection of AWS videos already available on the internet, with some of the content even duplicated. The hands-on labs do not really feel hands-on and some key concepts are only brushed upon, while the quizzes are sometimes not even related to the course content. On the introduction to precision and accuracy for example, the formula was incorrect in the video and the quiz treated recall, which was not even explained in the course.
Week 5 encompasses the content of the entire course and does it well. Weeks 1-4 contain endless repetitions and too many promotions. The total experience was therefore adversely affected (for me). The repetitions were downright annoying. Not what I've come to expect after many courses on Coursera that were first rate. Still, week 5 was spot-on. I can appreciate that this was a free course, but I would have preferred a paid course that had hands-on exercises and more thorough exams.
The course was very well communicated. But I was really disappointed that it was not communicated about the minor details like to close all and delete all instances of any usage of sagemaker profiles, usage of s3 bucket or any other service. Since I did not delete these, I was charged a huge amount. This is not at all acceptable and I was very disappointed that such an important detail was not communicated. Very very disheartening.
Some of the content was a bit repetitive. Each section and almost every video in each section is taught by a new person. As a result, a fair bit of content overlaps. I did think that the quiz sections could be improved as well. Often the questions barely related to the content in each week or would be about a very specific function or tool that wasn't even mentioned in the videos.
Well,theyarepromotingtheirMLSoftwarejustlikeotherswoulddobutItwas related to ML, only in the last week. No doubt, Sagemaker and other softwares are good, but we need to have more examples and/or at least more details of these frameworks. like which file size would used for what purpose.(your nomenclature needs to be discussed more unless they're not strategically discussing it.)
Some videos were difficult to understand. Also, there is some redundancy between some of videos (describing same functionality, etc.). And, it'd be good to get a big picture view of what all services are available, and how they are related/different, and how can they be used in real-life situations (introducing  of one thing at a time makes it bit difficult)
The course provided a lot of good information about the AWS products which I appreciate, however, I could've used some hands-on examples to follow along. The SAS certification course offered in Coursera has a free environment and videos walk you through examples. Also, the quizzes have too few questions to accurately test user knowledge gained in the videos.
The course provides a good overview of all the services amazon provides for the machine learning . The topics covered include rekognition , Comprehend , Transcribe , Glue , Sagemaker , Sagemaker Neo . This course is only recommended for those who do not have any knowledge about aws and would like to learn and get an overview of various services .
Nice course to get an overview about AWS ML products, though I would suggest to have more background explanations regarding the ML subject itself in order to help understand better AWS products and the approaches followed on each solution. It would also be highly recommended to have a way of experimenting those products in a sandbox style.
I was hoping to learn more ML with AWS. The quiz are too simple and there are no practical assignments which I can go through AWS myself. After only watching the videos I could not remember so much unfortunately. I lost motivation to go on after first weeks. On the very last day I managed to finish the course.  A bit disappointed.
Very informative about AWS Machine Learning, but the lessons are lacking of practical exercises. Effective learning is always about the balance between knowledge input, processing and output. But, you only can find the "input" components here. This course may help you to become an AWS user, but not a AWS professional.
This course tells us about many services of AWS which are you used for ML and gives a good knowledge when to use , how to use and why to use this services . It would been a much better course if they would have added some labs to it and explained certain concepts of ML .Anyways its a great course .
I personally found the course very interesting. However, the contents of weeks 1 and 2 are quite redundant since they explain basically the same things. Blaine Sundrud is a great teacher, his explanations were clear and effective. It is a shame we only see him in roughly 1 hour of the course.
Basically a marketing reel of all the various tools in the AWS suite. Slightly informational in the sense that I can now knowledgeably say "oh hey, you can do [that ML activity] pretty easily through a module in AWS" but otherwise this class was not a good use of my time.
The course is not very well defined. In some things the course is very advanced and goes through stuff quickly and in others it's not advanced enough.Some practical stuff would be nice. I think Amazon could create some sandboxes for learning included in the certificate.
The course is good for an overview Machine Learning in AWS, with examples of use cases, and how the AWS ecosystem can be utilised. There are not a lot of practical tasks, with hands on projects however, which would improve the course substantially, if possible.
The First 2-3 Weeks were so much engaging and was worth it. But as the course proceeds, it falls blank only  by giving introduction to all the tools required to build the functionalities.It was really a nice experience taking up this coirse !!
It was a decent course that gave an overview of the AWS and its components. AWS has all the solution to make an efficient and scalable ML/DL solutions.  It would be better it had an online lab or embedded environment to do hands-on. Thank you
I gave a three stars review for it is somewhat good for beginners by introducing Amazon's machine learning softwares and their features. It can be useful but not likely useful for those who are trying to learn machine learning from scratch.
Informative? Definitely. But more importantly, it felt like an extended advertising campaign for amazon services. However, it was helpful as you learn the basics of machine learning and also their implementation through various examples,
The practical aspect of the few of lectures are poorly explained and demonstrated.  It seems like class of theory lecture. Few of  the instructors are good but few  lectures are quite distasteful as  presented like a speech.
Some Practical teaching of how code works is not good enough. We want practical from the basics. Sometimes it starts from where and ends somewhere. Please make it more convenient to study.But in overall it was Good
Course is not hands-on. It is a compilation of Amazon Web Services available for ML. In this course you will not learn machine learning. You will learn different AWS services in a passive way. Not woth buying.
Class tends to focus more on memorizing charts than really giving me more practical AI knowledge. Also... why are so many of the lecturers speaking in monotone voices? Trying showing more enthusiasm, please!
Although it is an introductory course to ML on AWS, the videos are extremely long and causes attention to be lost after 10 minutes. My opinion is that they should try to put videos between 5 to 10 minutes.
Lots of repetition at the beginning of early machine learning concepts. A bit difficult to follow on some later topics. Would be nice if there were easy to access github and AWS links on the page.
The course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on MachineLearning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.
Its better to learn more about ML Algorithms and Python before-hand before opting for this course. Also, the whole thing felt more like an Amazon advertisement rather than an Educational Source.
It is an introduction to AI-based solutions on AWS. Sagemaker is discussed only in the last week. It would be interesting a more detailed course about SageMaker with some practice-lab.
The material was good.  Some redundancy between videos but that is ok.  The biggest problem was the quizzes.  They do not align with the video and don't seem to score correctly.
Although informational and intensive, it is very difficult to keep up with the later weeks when Amazon products are introduced with the lack of hands on experience on Coursera.
This course is good for overview only. They didn't include any single programming exercise plus they talk too much about features and they didn't discuss any drawbacks.
This is long theory and regarding AWS products. I liked one hour practical video on SageMaker

 by Denis Batalov in week 5, hoping to practice based on his lesson.
Some parts are great, with lot of detail. But some courses are more focused on let us know which features to buy and use. I was more interesting in how they worked
Its more of an advertisement for the machine learning tools provided by amazon web services than a course, but we can find some useful bits and pieces about ML.
It's a good course only for introduction to various amazon utilities which are extremely useful for machine learning. But as said before, Just an introduction!
The content is great, but the tests are very dull. There are no do-it-yourself sections also. It would be nice to have an assignment of sorts every week.
There is a lot of marketing and NO CODE at all. Anyway, as a ML developer I found it interesting and it helped me to understand some principles
Very Lengthy videos, might get bored if you are already familiar with Machine learning and stuff. Length of videos should be reduced
This course is made for people who work for Amazon! The course is not difficult at all. The quizzes could have been much difficult.
Largely an Amazon Sagemaker product intro, requires intermediate to significant level of ML background to fully appreciate.
Nice details understanding and practical life approach learning.More lab exercise would be good for hands-on experience.
I will learn about new technology it is very advance to me and it will very helpful to know new thing.Very Amazing
The lectures are good, more informative but I'm expecting more labs for this course to get hands-on experience.
Too Long, No Interactive quizzes, increase those contents which will force students to take this course.
Sometimes it feels like a an advertisement of the products. No real hand on quizes, it feel very basic.
2 serious well versed well experienced lectureres (denis and blayne) were amazing. others were not :(
it was useful..since i was a beginer i ere not able understand some concepts especially the last week
Overall courses are informative. Yet, there are several sessions where improvements should be made.
i gave a 3 star because of the lack of coding ethusiasm,their was a lack in coding experience
It seems much more like a sponsor of amazon than course about how to use aws frameworks.
it gives an overview of several options with aws unfortunately no hands on excersizes
too lengthy and I didn't understand the method of teaching. Overall, a good course.
It will be more good if they give us access to labs atleast. Only MCQ no labs
too many lengthy videos with very little hands on labs or other experiences.
Too long videos in fourth and fifth weeks gave us headache But good to learn
The first part of the course is interesting but the rest its pure marketing
Theoretical description is good. But course lacks some practical exposure.
Valuable course, it would be even better if they could include handsOn
Coverage of some concepts is shallow and a lot of repetitive content
Very basic introduction for various Machine Learning services on AWS
good experience and videos very clear and word thank you so much
The course must have covered some form of practical lab sessions
Not bad. expected more programming assignments for learning aws
unable to understand, and i am unable to complete this course.
Needs to be more hands on, consider using a lab for exercises
There is no hands-on. Should give credit and try hands-on
It's very helpful those who are interested please do it.
There should be credits to use the amazon platform
Good but session not as expected. Keep it up 👍
Better if we can get hands-on training as well
Mostly they are promoting their web services
Good leraning in this aws machine learning
More of a sales pitch than I was expecting
Nice course apart of some boredom topics
ned to provide hands-on based assignment
Very focused on Amazon's current tools
Learnt with new technology of Amazon.
good for introduction course of AWS
Good course, but lots of marketing.
Looks More like Amazon Advertisment
There was no hands-exposure to AWS
Not up-to the expectation I had
Only First 2-3 Weeks were good.
Need practical assigments
It was awesome course .
i was  expecting more
to much videos only
very rudimentary
proper content
ok ok course.
The course seem to be balanced between those who are in machine learning already and want to use the AWS tools, and those who want to use machine learning tools but not the go deep into data science. I enjoyed the course, but it will be more helpful if you could separate the courses and give those already into machine learning, more hands on to the AWS tools and remove the repetitiveness in the concept we already know. Coming from ML Course (Stanford) by Andrew Ng. Week 4 and 5 had a lot of useful concepts that we can use. Over-rally it was worth every pen.
A very good guide for understanding the full Amazon web services flow but lack of proper implementation
Good overview of ML with some deep technical sections as well
For the ones who just know the basics of machine learning can opt for this course and explore the services provided by aws from building, training, and deploying models or use them in just one click. The sagemaker examples that are shown in week-5 are useful for hands-on experience. If you are a student then you can create an aws educator account and perform them else you have to pay for these services in order to do the same. But either way, without hands-on experience doing the course, is of no use so even if it costs you a few dollars you should do it.
This course was really helpful to understand the Machine Learning concepts with Amazon AWS. It cover almost all the important basics concepts in Machine Learning. Lecture are very good, especially the hands on section demos included in the lectures give a surface knowledge about how to deploy the program into a real time Machine order Product. In short this lecture series is very interesting for beginners. Hoping more courses in this Subject in future. Thank you Amazon Team for this very useful platform.
Overall it feels like a pretty good overview for people who have some experience in Machine Learning but are trying to perform some more complex tasks. I will say that the later weeks were much more interesting than the first, but that is probably because I was already aware of a lot of the first week's material. It would be nice if there were some assignments in this course so that we could attempt some of the things we see in the lectures. The quizzes are not comprehensive enough.
This course really helps in understanding the way we can work on AWS cloud and using its various services to train the machine learning models. AWS provides a one stop solution for everything right from storing the huge data to doing feature engineering on it and hypertuning the parameters. This course  clearly gives us an insight into how AWS reduces the burden of integrating a number of tools and resources to train the model for our use.
The course gives a good overview of machine learning in first couple of weeks then dives into the tools provided by Amazon to build efficient and cost-effective models. Models can be built using their templates or from scratch. Overall Amazon services seem to be good to provide people with lesser experience in Algorithms and functioning of models, to built a solution for their business problems.
Just an excellent guide and really eye-opening about all the opportunities there are for ML in AWS. I just wish sometimes they'd talk more about actually how to use or how the tools work than focusing too much on selling it to us. But is great to find out and to discover so many opportunities and to get to learn some crucial stuff like the pipeline and how to integrate the solutions.
As the name says, the course is really good for people that have interest on using AWS tools. But otherwise, if you are someone like me that was expecting to learn more about machine learning as a general topic it might not be the best choice. But since on the description it states that the course is to learn about this tool, it might be useful for most people.
Basic course to understand what type of Product Amazon provides for ML training, deploying the model and made the prediction. one main thing that was missing from the course was the LAB since practical is much more important than theory.Most of the time in the course they just talk about their own services instead of how to do that or this.
The course is overall a great experience with AWS ML and AI offerings however I feel like most AWS courses it really focuses on selling you on the products and services versus explaining how they work.  Week 02 could use some more time on explaining the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and the different basic formulas to the Confusion Matrix .
Week 1 and week 2 are awesome, very informative whereas start from week 3 until week 5, is quite confusing because there are number of tools, and I'm not sure whether in which stage I should use them, perhaps in future, prepare the lectures according the flow of use of the tools, so that we can have better understanding
Thanks Amazon Web Service, and Coursera. AWS machine learning tools make things easy for developers, not only developers but it's also helpful non-tech persons. And this course describe those briefly. Video content, teaching style, interact session, quiz etc make the journey very interesting.
Provides an overview of how to get started with ML on AWS platform. Gives a glimpse of all the various tools available on AWS to make model building, training, tuning and deployment a hassle free process. Would recommend this course to anyone who is starting out on the AWS learning journey.
Found this course to be very helpful to get foundations strong and to get an introduction to the phenomenal field of Machine Learning. But I would seriously not recommend this course to experts in the field of machine learning because no hands-on experience could be gained from this course.
Nice compilation of AWS ML technologies. It was nice to see how things are done in practice in AWS platform even if you're not a SW developer. The course reminded me of a presales courses of major SW vendors. Highly recommended for persons with no AWS background, but basic knowledge of ML.
Getting started with the AWS Machine learning course is very informative. You'll get a basic idea about what is AI, ML, and DL.Giving 4 rating cause of this is the only free course available in this series. You can add more free courses in the AWS course series having basic concepts.
Good course that covers the basics of using ML and DL within the AWS environment. While many of the presenters were well focused and articulated, others were difficult to understand and their thoughts were not well collected. Overall, a great course and fantastic introduction to AWS.
The course was really very informative and  a brief explanation of how to use Amazon Cloud Services for machine learning starting from ground truth annotations to deployment. Only one thing, had the long videos being fragmented into shorter videos, it could have been better.
This course was nice  but i thought they will teach us some technical stuff but it all gone wrong but still nice informative series for getting started your ML journey with amazon AWS services and good introduction and example and rest of is on us how we will use .
Overall, this course was quite informative and gave a brief introduction to the AWS stack they have to offer. However, the course lacked some hands-on exercises, so one less star. But still, I will recommend for those who wish to get started with this technology.
The course is great to understand the basics of machine learning ,Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning as it gives overview on all of that .The back point is that it is not project based ,if there is project involved then it become great course to learn.
Great overview of AWS Machine Learning although it would be great to see further working examples of how this can be applied to processes in Financial Services, such as automating customer call trees, reducing processing time for manual reconciliations.
With no prior ML experience, the course provided a good overview of AWS services and showcased the abilities of each.  It's really an eye opener to see how far AI & ML have progressed and what can be accomplished in a fairly short period of time.
It was a good course and even the instructors were good. I have just one suggestion that please try to make the videos a little more happening because they sometimes felt like a lecture and not some online interactive course
I think some topics need to be updated, there are long videos that can be divided into tasks. The course covers the basics of using Amazon Web Services to implement Machine Learning. Good introduction, thanks!
This is a nice course offered by amazon. Basically this course help to understand that who the machine learning mechanism work and here i learn the practical application with the help of amazon aws tools.
Liked the course. Provided me with the various services provided by AWS, although I did not understand a few concepts since I am a complete novice at Machine Learning. Thanks you Amazon and Coursera.
Excelente como revisión de todas las herramientas que posee AWS, ideal para comenzar. Lo único que faltó es la opción de tener labs prácticos (como otros cursos que he tomado de GCP).
This course should be designed to serve people already have some knowledge of ML. I hope there are more hands-on lab practices. There is also some repetition among content provided.
Good overviewWould be a great course if there were practical examples (actually playing with a Jupyter notebook) vs. simply seeing them on a screen.But extremely helpful nonetheless
THE PROFESSIONAL COURSE THIS PLATFORM IS OFFERING IS VERY GOOD. I GOT THE OVERVIEW OF THE AWS MACHINE LEARNING AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THIS KNOWLEDGE TO MY WORK
It is quite informative and let you know how to go about AWS for the different task required in various disciplines of Data Science. Happy to go through this course.
COURSE WAS REALLY NICE. HOPE NUMERICAL QUESTIONS WERE EXPLAINED A LITTLE MORE IN SECOND MODULE. THIS COURSE HELPED ME LEARN VARIOUS THINGS ABOUT AWS MACHINE LEARNING
It was a little tricky because I am an absolute rookie for data science and algorithms, but if you sit down and listen to the videos and take note, you'll be fine.
Honestly speaking I had no idea about AWS services before taking up this course. This course is pretty amazing with clearcut explanations required for a beginner .
Great training for basic SAGEMAKER understanding and Machine Learning.  A lot more practice is needed if you want to really be able to run the models on your own.
requires some prerequisite knowledge in machine learning , but gives a good leaning experience and acts as a informative user guide for the platform and services
The presentation easy to understand. But i prever lab or hands on project that using aws service so the idea of using aws service will be more understanable.
A very dense and helpful course. However have a lack of practice. I think if they give some practical examples and some exercises, the course will be better
It was good course to get started with AWS Machine Learning. The only thing I wish it had was notes so that we can read after watching the videos.
The course was amazing it's help me lot to understand about the AWS working and about machine learning.  It's going to help me lot in my projects.
Course in which didnt get bored !......and yes very good content Team CourseraHope to have a  bright future because of this course ....Thank You!
It was a very good course with very good contents. But it was not for the beginners. One must have a good primary knowledge to appear the course.
The course introduces the major machine learning  concepts and amazon products available to implement them in a very beginner friendly manner.
The course is very interesting. I particularly enjoyed learning about AI, ML and DL. The course is well structured and gives good examples.
Starting weeks are more informative about how to start up a work or business, later it discussed all about amazon working rules and ideas.
Overall course and course material is good however it will help you to utilize these skills in the places where the Company is using AWS.
Really fun, but teachers assume we know everything about AWS architecture. It would be ideal to had a lab with hand on experience on AWS.
Great course, It was not a complete guide but now i understand what machine learning with aws looks like and even got some hands-on.
Tq for u gudience nd it was fanatic to learn the course u all were fantastic in this course and thank every one of them who help me
Its a great course but the knowledge is too much for someone who has no idea about the cloud services and all those terminologies.
Nice course for those who are capable of building ML algorithms already and wish to implement these projects to practice via AWS.
This course is a good overview of Amazon's ML/AI services. I found the detailed walk through of SageMaker in Week 5 very useful.
all the information and practicals are awesome , need to have some practicals in this course it will make it more intresting...
it's good to know how the system behind Amazon works and sagemaker is solving our most of the problem. thanks for this course.
The faculty was awesome . There are no Pre -requisites for this course. Just be sure and please don't skip the lectures.
Some videos went into too much code assuming everyone knows the specific functions. It added to the length needlessly.
It was a great course, truly informative and knowledgeable for beginners who do not know any thing about AWS. Thanks!
Some videos were too long, they could have been splitted in more mini-videos in order to keep the topic interesting.
More hands-on assignments would be more effective. AWS credits for this learning process would also be very helpful.
Video quite long without labs. Content is insightful and instructor delivery amazing content and presentation skills
It would useful if you provide the jupyter notebooks for us to have a better understanding of what you are showing.
Amazing experiance with aws , which there was more of practical knowlegde but thank you ,it helped clear my doubts.
It is an amazing course, a complete industrial level package of machine learning. Good for beginner students also.
Nice but i didnot understand the programme at all. need more precise and comprehensive way of teaching all coding.
I like the module but I need more about the practical lesson so I can learn it better. Thank you for the lesson.
I really like to  thank coursera and their respective instructors who helped to understand such concepts clearly
Superb teaching from the experts. But the need of the certificate is very much important for us for each course.
Very interesting material.  Although the content is a bit dense, it was engaging and well-presented.  Thank you.
Get learning about machine learning algorithms and model as use for forming the huge business of Amazon services
it is the most valuable learning about machine language and and easy to grasp each one of the topic...thank you
Quiz could be more practical, with exercises on SageMaker (which could be provided to subscribers for free)
Good introduction to various services being offered by Amazon. Learnt a lot about various M.L. technologies
Great course content, trainers and videos. I just suggest to split long videos into short duration videos.
It was quick. Most of the ML frameworks were already available on AWS and I just had to see how they work.
I am so greatfull to learn this course with an enough material to learn about machine learning.Thank you.
ExcellentCourse is completed but certificates not download and alway say verify your accounts it's is bad
I'd like to learn more ML / DL basics. But in any case it's not hard course you can complete in few days.
it was a great course i got lot of knowledge but it could be improved if a live project could be taught
It's an overview of what AWS offers for machine learning, but don't expect great knowledge acquistion.
It's very great to learn from starting to ending and I got skills related to development of my career
Very basis course. Good for those starting from the scratch and want to move in AWS architecture.

Not deep into ML techniques, but a lot of demos and how to use as the best AWS features for a smooth ML processes
Demonstration is very fast and in week five one video is 70 minutes long.  It can be divided in to several short videos.  Seeing a long video is creating a boredom.  Otherwise it is a very nice course.
The course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.
Dan Mbaga, Kirsten Dupart and Denis Batalov were quite instrumental and to the point. I appreciate these sessions but would want Coursera to allow free users to submit the quiz at the end of these courses (as of now, it shows a button to upgrade).
Very good course to learn basics of Machine learning for beginners. Instructors are very knowledgeable.I got lot of learning and motivation to continue my learning in area of machine learning.
Thank you Coursera ! i have  enjoy your E-learning programe i think some topic very dificult for me and i can't undestand some topic. i hope i will start again and review again all module.
Great content for someone new to this space. I really enjoyed all the information, thanks to all who are willing to share the knowledge.  I'm ready to tackle the next course of AWS ML.
It's a practical easy to follow introductory course of AWS machine learning with Sagemaker. I'm looking forward to learning more about Sagemaker and get some practical experience.
AWS machine learning is has constructively put this course together in an informative steps to learn how to build, train and deploy machine learning models using intelligent algorithm Sagemaker with the notebook instance (Jupiter notebook) to orcherstrate the course training in a meaningful way. Its a beginner to intermidiate level of development in Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning. I will highly recommend this course. It is infor mative and well constructed. Thank you AWS Team.
i am very thankful to the AWS team to gave me such a informative knowledge about artificial intelligence, machine learning , deep learning .Your platform gave knowledge about the amazon sagemaker, amazon polly,  about the knowledge of metadata , amazon text to speech features image identifying algorithms and many more I think through your platform i will be able more understandable about the full knowledge of artificial intelligence, machine learning and pyhton programming also
Effective course.  Uses real world examples to explain not just the
various components of AWS but also how to effectively use. Great content for someone new to this space. I
really enjoyed all the information, thanks to all who are willing to share the
knowledge . if anyone want to know
about  Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning  I will recommend to join
this course.
Really I enjoyed this course. All the faculties and developers had explained well. I came to know what are the basics and how to use code, deep learning ,amazon sage maker and some more other concepts had been explained perfectly. I hope this could be the best online course foe each and every student or beginners .
I am a beginner for machine learning. i don't have any background knowledge for ML but this course is very good for start. You get to know about what is ML and it's pipeline. How to create the model, train it and deploy it in AWS. You get to know about Amazon Segemaker. Overall it's a very good course for beginner.
This course although heavy on very vivid business use courses is still a great starting point to get a deep, detailed, and structured look at AWS and its machine learning services. The use cases do help in passing on knowledge and also thinking along the lines of implementing the techniques in one's own projects.
It's a good course but ir's not what I was hping for. I though there would be more programming and using the AWS tools, but instead it was looking at how to use them and no practice at all. Anyways. it was good to learn all this tools and the instructors at Amazon are really good, so overall it was a good course.
This course was very helpful and insightful to learn the basics of machine learning and how to apply this knowledge in an applicable way using AWS. Also shows in a very brief but informative way some of the services AWS offers and gives use cases to better understand the scope of each. I strongly recommend it.
It is an excellent course and the way they teach is just like a real time experience for beginners it'll be a great experience of learning. The teaching is appreciatable and their hardwork, efforts in teaching is fantastic and for a student with intrest this is the best platform to prove himself.
I love this course on AWS ML. The good part is, you will remain motivated. Secondly, the course is structured to be beneficial for the beginners as well as ML Practitioners because, some topics covers Hyper Parameter tuning, some piratical aspects on AWS SageMaker, Groundtruth services, etc.
The course helped me a lot in gathering practical knowledge in my relevant field of study.Thanks a lot coursera for providing such a wonderful course and my best wishes to the amazon team for providing many valuable resources and learning related informations about the course
This was helpful for me, because next year I'm going into coding and programming and i needed some research about A.I., but here I found something more. I recommend this course to even those who have no idea what A.I. means. They explain everything very well. Well done.
Effective course. Uses real world examples to explain not just the various components of AWS but also how to effectively use. them. It is a genuine hands on course and I would recommend that all those interested in AI & ML must undergo this course to get a head start.
Deployment part of ML was a puzzle for me before this class. After you learn the ML basics, this is the next step. It also gives you insight about how automation is coming to ML and what is ML as a service. Definitely recommended if you are an active ML practitioner.
This Course has been very helpful as it took me through the parameters and insights of Amazon Web Services giving importance to each and every keyconcepts of Machine learning that Amazon has inducted. I would like to thank coursera for providing me with this course.
Its great course.  Its very practical and explained in simple way such a  very complex stuff. It would be great to have hands on using qwiklabs.  If it provide qwiklabs access it would be best course in Coursera. Thanks to all the instructors and did fantastic job.
I leant a lot from this course. It guide me and teaching well and give a clear picture of AI AMZ. it is must take course. 100% recommend. If can please give student like me, free trial hand on for all AWS AI framework or platform for education purpose. Thanks.
Actually it was so different and confusing when i thought to start aws course. but after starting i felt its amazing and the instructors are also awesome with great knowledge. i learned many things using this course and wanted to learn more. Thank You #AWS
Very nice course for getting introduced to AWS services as well as different ML algorithms utilized by Amazon machine learning team. I would have loved to have some more practical examples but overall had a pleasant learning experience with this course.
Basic knowledge for starters for using AWS, further courses should get you deeper in each section of this course and some personal research should be done in order to understand the concepts in a more meaningful way, but it is a nice place to start.
This Course introduced me to a whole new Dimension of Machine Learning that is currently offered by Amazon.Thanks to Coursera for enlightening me during this really crazy situation. Thanks to Team AWS. Looking forward to learning other ML concepts.
