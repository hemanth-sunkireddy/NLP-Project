In my opinion this course does not teach you to 'speak English professionally', but it teaches you to 'learn how to speak English'. I was looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional emails and have professional phone conversations, like which words I should use, what common sentences are or how to build up professional sentences. I am a bit disappointed and think this course was a waste of time for me. This is really meant for people that are learning to speak English and don't know how to pronounce words or how to respond to people in a really easy way.
It's a mix of too much basic and irrelevant tips from different realms: pronounced english (which, in my opinion could be a great course of it's own), public speeking (only the basic of how to deliver which can be sum up to one page) and how to interact with other people (like how to say you are agree or disagree??? I strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos, I'm pretty sure that he knows that 5-years-old-extremly-basic-stuff).As much I like this concept of coursera, "speak english professionally" or even "speak english" is really a big statement for that course. Actually, from what it seems, the main point of that course is to get the students to purchase the full package of courses that the Georgia Tech Language Institude is offering. If you really like to know a great course that relates to the topic, I strongly advise you to check out the course "Public Speaking" by Dr. Matt McGarrity here at coursera. Best of luck.
It’s impossible to cancel the subscription, which is too much to begin with. It’s impossible to reach anyone. There is no customer service reps who can help out. It was one big hassle. You should do something about your customer service, it’s horrible. I’m sorry for being this negative but that’s the fact.
I was hoping alot from this course. But it contains so basic things only.
I was expecting something else, very basic information.
it really was a poor course! im sorry. The tips was good nothing extraordinary but i can't believe that the others students was the person who correct my english homework. SO, i will never know if a made a good english class or was poor
This course is not what I expected out to be, It teaches all the things that a beginner English speaker already knows.I'm sorry but It was such a waste of time.
i have long back completed my course.  But, the course is not producing my certificates or grades.I have reviewed enough assignments but still the course is forcing me to review more and more,,,This is not justifiable... In such case, I would not recommend anybody to do this course, as the course is not completing the grades on time. I am not satisfied with the timeliness.
here there is nothing special to learn English. No interesting content, no good lectures, no significant material, no PDF, nothing special at all.  I am totally disappointed with the content and lectures and overall its boring.
It is way too lengthy and not comfortable. It was not easy to learn and the instructions are not clear at all. Wasted my time on this.
I was looking for a course to practice speeches and dialogues in English, but it seems this course is not filling my requirements.
It was not as amazing and useful as it was described. It was only a bunch of elementary points that are available in Google!!!!
Didn't think that it was for English as a second language learner.
I did not  like the methodology  so I don´t  want to continue it.
Need more lectures and same thing repeat in many lectures  .
I'm not getting classI'm not getting to change my timings
just the waste of time.
didnt find it helpful ,
Not at all interesting
worst explanation
bad instructor
The course is great but beginners but not for intermediate and advance learners. I must appreciate Coursera for providing free courses. Thank you
Lectures are good, but I don't think it could work for improving speaking English.
Not very useful.
I truly disliked the fact that I have to be reviewed by people that have no idea how to properly speak or write English. They will give you the worst grades even if they don't have any idea or what they are saying. People from India are the WORST.This course is really boring and flawed. Get the right people to review the assignments, stop being so lazy. This must be done by a qualified professor, not by a child from India.
I think this course is good for beginners, but for people that have an advanced level and need more tools for professional development is very very basic and it would have take less time....i was expecting more content¡¡
i wish it had more quiz and give more information in English , it feels like a general information in English not like sentences and exercises as an application of what is given , i hope to get better content , thanks
Some of the content is interesting, but there is not real feedback to improve the pronunciation and listening skills. I had to look for a dictionary to be able to hear the words when they could be here.
Not what I expected. Talks more about the professional settings where conversations are going to take place and not about helping student with their professional English speaking skills.
Do remember to CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, after you have completed this course.  Otherwise, they will continue to CHARGE you!.  PLEASE DO TAKE NOTE.
In my opinion, you could use more interesting tools, to practice listening and pronunciation. Thanks
Excellent! But I couldn't complete the course without payments.
the projects are very hard and useless

This course is fascinating but could be further delightful by enlarging more exercise issues. You should organize a live phone call or meeting situation rather reporting the recording assignment. Moreover, the program should be further explanatory with the more additional week.
Thank you for putting all the efforts in this course. The quizzes can be made more interactive by say, filling out or editing a conversation between two hypothetical parties, it might be a better learning experience than the way quizzes are right now.
Yes there're some pronunciation tips and situational conversation practice to help you get started, but in speaking of  helping students to become a "professional“ English speaker, I think the course still has a long way to go.
A very decent approach and well balanced learning material. I just wish we could cover more knowledge and to my opinion, once a course slips under the "Specialization umbrella" it gets ruined and the experienced with it.
This course has a great potential, but the subject of each week  was very superficial. The speaker is very good, your english is clear and easy to understand. The subject covered is interesting, but could be more deeper.
Good course for beginners. The way of teaching is really impressive. Most of the things were much familiar to what we have already learnt in schools and colleges, but you have taught how to apply it.
Great course but it would be better if they exclude peer-grade assignment of week 5. for this option,i had to wait for 2 months even after submitting my   week 5 assignment.
This is a great course for those who are beginners in English. It is easy to follow and the exams are based on the lessons that were taught.
Thanks all, but this course contain a lot of basicsI think I will learn conversation with other people and talking with very good speaker
Hi my name is sruthi. I learned how to speak in English of online and phone. Thanks corsera for giving this opportunity to learn english.
If learners can speak or talk with native speakers or any speakers of equivalent skills then it can help more.
This course will not be enough to reach your goal,  you’ve to help yourself with more effort.
Better if the last pitch is graded by professionals because some students don't grade fairly.
There's plenty of technical glitches in the peer-graded assignments, which should be fixed.
Great course, just not what I was looking for. I was looking for something more advanced.
Thanks for your time it was an interesting course and very helpful
I thought it involved a lot of participation but didn't got that
thanks for everythings my teachers:) 

I hope to visit you soon.
This course have material enought for our the learners
good but supporting material are poor
Simple and Easy way to learn English
this course is very helpful for us
nice course at least to start with
This is an outstanding  course.
It is ok but very small
It very helpful for me
it very good for me
I found that this course was very well structured and also going straight to the point that are important to have a good spoken English for the USA. The exercises offered are really good, but as there is no integrated platform to record voice, it is very difficult to rate or be rated properly because many of us have bad microphones, and/or bad headphones. for example, I recorded my prompts using a professional headphone for skype that we use at the office, could hear them perfectly, but some people complained about poor quality and low level ... I also had trouble with some people not understanding clearly instruction and expecting the exact words given as example being used in the answer, this is also something to better clarify I think in the explanations!To wrap up, it was a very good experience, I intend to follow the other courses in the future, because in the overall it has refreshed my english very well and recalled me about the essentials, thank you!
This course can help you to speak English in a formal way. It teaches you briefly the main things you have to know and to master in order to deal with conversations whether in person or on the phone. Besides, it gives you the keys to pronounce rightly words and sentences using intonation, stress words and letters, English rhythm, etc.The assignments at the last of the week were constructive and helpful.I really advice you to take that course especially if you don't want to spend time in searching a relevant course that will give you the main things and expressions to use.If you want to learn how to write professionally, I don't recommend this course to you.I thank all the creators and the instructors of this course. It was a good experience.
it's a good course, helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english. The only problem that i find whit this course isn't about the course, it's about the peer to peer grading, is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes, not in all cases.Also is a short course, the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course, i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents.
I have not yet to finish all the modules of this course, though. I can find it quite valuable for all persons seeking to improve thier English, not least for non-native speakers. On top of it, what sets this class apart from the others is instructor's attitude. To put it more detailed, it is easily noticed that they incessantly endeavor to impart prime information as clearly as possible. Really appreciate Georgia Tech for offering such like this source on the house
Nice it has very good information, it does not take a lot of time to complete but it has good information about how to improve someones English.The only drawback is that the peer assessments are being performed by users like me who I am not certain whether they can correct the way that someone talks. I found very hard to grade someone on word stress or sentence stress as I was not 100% what is the right. I gave full grade as long as I could understand them.
Joining this course develops effectively my speaking skills although it is a short week. During the course, I have to put in effort to speak the word and the sentence correctly. However, this course is worth attending. I have new experience to have meet with my peers from different places. I am happy to attend your course and participating in this course. I am really grateful to your well-prepared video lectures and well-organized assignment.
The course was very effective. It helped me to feel more confident in speaking. Especially, when I heard my voice and pronunciation by recording assignments, I could find my mistakes and fix them as I was learning the right one. On the other hand, the word stress module was complex. But I assume that it is a subject that should be studied by itself.I'd like to thank you to the teachers who gave us this opportunity and effort to teach.
It's really amazing, I love it a lot because it gave me how to deal with people around you in your work. But I think you should increase exercises to because there are a few videos each week. Please increase the videos in this course to develop ourselves by practicing through the course as well as assignments, On top of that, you should make a video conference between students and instructors to practice what we've learned.
As an advanced English speaker, for me this course goes too little into improvement of pronounciation.The tips for conversations - small talk, phone, online etc. - are only very basic as well.
Good course for beginners though and I also liked the interspersal of little questions and tasks along the way (although also too simple imo).Very good - but obviously only paid content - are the teamwork assignments.
I was expecting a bit more challenging course for deeper talks or expositions, anyways all the course become much more interesting with the past of time, I learned important keys and top-secret skills that I have not taken into account before. I want to congratulate developers and teachers for the excellent job they did during the whole course and the material proposed for students research, Thank you.
It’s a great course.you learned so much for very short period of time and very low cost..the only downside is, which is  I think it’s very important is ,I hope the instructor at least put a comment or have final say/grade in each assignment we submitted, instead  just the co students, specially with this specific course, knowing that most of the students is non native English speaker.
I love this course. You can fix your pronunciation and learn more about vocabulary. Peer graded assignment is also easy to do as long as you utilize the group forum. however, i think this course is very basic to me. if you are a beginner in English, then this course is perfect for you. Nevertheless, i still got a lot of new knowledge from this course
I have almost completed week one. I learned about what words to stress in a sentence and how to use the innotation at the end of the sentence. It is fun to go through the course contents. I would have given it five stars when it actually have helped us by giving analogies on more conversations formally and informally. Well, thank you.
This course is very helpful for those who are weak in pronouncing the words and the telephonic communication. It helped me a lot to improve my English speaking and other communication skills . One must enroll for this course which provides the best platforms for the studnets who are poor in English . I really enjoyed the course .
I  Am Gaurang Sharma already familiar with all this rules but when as a student i learn lots of skill like how to present your self within short time ,Ice breaking questions and telephonic and interview preparation practice such a nice explaination by tutor  thanks to Georgia Tech for providing nice facility  of e learning
I have enjoyed this course. I have learned so many things actually i dont know ,that is small small mistakes we do while speaking like word stress . I like the rythem of english which i have learned in this course . I think this will be more useful in my future.Thanks a lot ,I am  very happy to take a part in this course.
If this could be reviewed to reduce the time spent a little bit without compromising on the core content, it would be better. I really like the all the assignments, it reinforce the learnings. These assignments should be keep as is, if I may suggest. Many thanks for a well-designed course. More powers to Coursera!
The course is interesting, I learned too many subjects such as stress intonation, how to listen to me and how to practice intonation but I would have liked the course can be a little more complete I want to mean more exercises and more exams.
I don't know if possible live feedback with the teacher.Thanks a lot
Thank you so much Ma'am for such an interesting course. It helped me a lot in improving my English fluency. I feel more confident than before. It was a great session. Also great effort by both the professors. They made the course clear. Thanking you again for such a great effort.
Great&useful course. I also learned a number of usefull tips not concerning English. Lots interesting about business communications.I assett the course by not the highest point, because it's impossible loading a homework in a free version (without buying a course). It's a pity(.
In this course i have learned how to communicate with people online, In person and on the phone with proper word stress  and intonation and how to reply positively to interviewer during interview. I look forward to take more course from Georgia Tech Institute. Thank you.
The course was very useful! Through it I have learned how to organize my professional speech and be more confident and informative in it. Only one advice for a future improvement of course - please add more examples of speeches and more phrases into videos...
A very good course to learn speaking English. I truly liked the wonderful assignments and am elated to takeaway some really good learning. The trainer is very confident and vibrant. Kudos to Georgia Tech to have designed such a great course on Communication.
This course was awesome & I had some fun to learn speak English professionally In person, online & on the phone. It develops my skill of stress, communication, presentation,  public speaking.  Thanks to Coursera & my fellow and honorable teacher.
Hiii.. This course is very useful to me. I feel i spended my holidays very useful. It give more inforamation about our simple mistakes while speaking. I performed well but I don't know how they calculated my gradIe.. Otherwise this course is good
The course do cover a few facets of speaking English professionally and it's very helpful. I feel, however, it is not so much deep and concrete as it didn't take much time to apply the techniques and cover a boarder range of situations.
The teacher is very nice. The content of the class is clear to understand. I think it fits people who have little English language using experience but want to improve.  I would hope to learn more specific things during the course.
It is easier to catch up with different modules and practice well. This course is really useful to achieve English speaking skills. But, it is better to reveive a certificate of this course if the learner passes.
Everything regarding this course is absolutely amazing except the methodology of grading. Developers should come up with better ways to grade assignments as the current methods welcomes a way to plagiarism.
It was a wonderful experience. This course helped me to imrove my professional english in a way that I could easily build up my confidence and enhance my speaking skills through fun and engaging activities.
Very good course I recommend it on everyone but  you should train more with your self as the course teach you only the correct way to speak and you practice it as much as you need.Thanks for the Lecturers
very useful. i liked and enjoyed the journey of learning in these five weeks. the instructor is very clear and taught very interestingly. Thanks to her. she looked poised and cheerful and professional
Good course for someone with low confidence. Course starts slowly and gives easy tasks to boost confidence. At end of course you can easily talk and don't worry that someone might not understand you!
It is a good course because they teach you not only English grammar but how to make a speech, body language, tips por business presentation and public speaking. It is a little basic but i is helpful.
The tips provided, the processes, the information have been of great help, 
important to generate the necessary confidence during daily activities. Thank you very much Mrs Stephens and Mrs Attruia
It is great. The way of teaching is  very comfortable. The interaction with peers is a great advantage. It helped a lot to correct our mistakes. I am very thankful to Georgia Tech and Coursera.
I was very happy taking this course , I have learned a lot of things and the assignments were very good practice of the language, thank you for this opportunity to have a such experience here!
I had a great experience taking this Course. This Course is well structured and designed especially for  beginners to improve their fluency in English speaking and taking it to a new level.
I really appreciate this course. This course is crucial for students and for professional (beginners). However the most important thing is, those links which are shared in reading sections.
It is very easy and clear, good for all the first year international students who did not perform well in TOEFL or GRE. Maybe a little bit too easy and too slow for advanced learner.
Very Nice job i am very glad because i  like this lesson is very useful to gain my knowledge very much.Thank you so much and i wish you Good luck for better work and more courses.
I really enjoyed my time when I took this course, however there're some parts of the course he covered it in shallow way " speaking about the first videos of this course ".
It's a good course to learn the very basics of speaking  English. I recommend it to people who want to improve their Speaking and Communication skills in English language.
It's always good to learn true ways to pronounce words, what this course has offered. I humbly appreciate their efforts and the additional sources that they have provided.
very interesting training to do, it has helped a lot to have better pronunciation and improve my presentations. only I think the course should have more tasks to do.
I am very glad to share with you my experience with the course. I got more than what I expected. Especially pronunciation differences,  stress and rhythm of English.
It's really helpful . As we can be accessed to top universities throughout the world . With this course we can build up our confidence while speaking in English .
Good course, Instructor teach every situations very clearly.I got lot of knowledge about communication and also I really like this method of teaching English.
grading system is not teachers should check weather the student have checked correctly or not due to which students grades spoil,else everything was great
This course is very useful for someone if have pronunciation problems. It's more about fluency and your pronunciation.Hope you all get the those skills.
it's a very helpful course with many information that help u in many aspects but the problem with it that i can't see the  reviews of my assignments .
Nice and systematic arrangements of the contents make me to understand and practice well and learn correctly what it is actually not what we speak.
I like what I learn here I get a lot of new skills like  the elevator speech basics of meeting online body language and organizing my pitchthanks
This course is really good for me.If you want to speak fluency, you will need to join this course and you will practice speaking more.Thanks.
It was just amazing to learn this course and was explained in a very catchy way!!! Thank you Georgia Tech for such a wonderful session!!!!

I had a great experience taking in this class. It's very easy to understand and practical. In every week I have learned more and more and it helps me improve my speaking a lot. Thank you so much.
really I'm very enthusiastic in this course , the instructor gives me an important information which I didn't heard before , I'm very glade to this .thank to my instructor and thanks coursera <3
This course is really amazing. The assessments make it more fun to do and use what you learnt in the module to actually practice and get peers review about it. Really love it. THANK YOU COURSERA.
I've benefited a lot by pursuing this course. Small pronunciation and word stress has been cleared. I would suggest non-English speakers to take up this course to enhance their English language skill.
Although I have been teaching English for more than two years, this course has indeed improved my speaking skill to have more natural and fluently no matter what the situation is.
This course is one of the most relevant and superb Coursera offerings I have taken recently. I teaching business English online to professionals and managers with multinational corporations around the globe. Since my lesson content includes all of the communication activities in this course ---- I was able to enhance my own knowledge and expertise to benefit our private sector clients.  I learned new strategies which greatly improved my expertise. Thank you! We hope Coursera continues to offer such a top notch course.
Very great program for ESL learner at intermediate level. I am looking for something at higher level. However, I found your course was very interesting. I have learned new communication skills for the very first time. Something that I thought I have already knew it. I will introduce your class to my international friends. Wish you all the best and your succeed in this program.

Firstly, I would like to give a thank to Mrs. Amalia and Mrs. Leah from Georgia Institute of Technology for giving me an opportunity to learn about English Speaking in a professional way. I do like the intensive learning by using the recorded video and the subtitle (if we don't understand what the speaker is saying, we may see the subtitle). Additionally, the relevancy of what was taught and the given peer-graded assignment makes me feel like communicating with someone as a professional worker in a company. Hence, I do recommend this course for those who will apply for a job/internship and still learning in the university in order to gaining more knowledge and make yourself get ready to build communication with everyone from different cultures. To conclude, I'd like to give 5 stars for this course!
Thanks to Georgia Technology Institute and mainly to the instructors for your excellent and professional work done with these amazing courses of the "Specialization: Improve your English Communication Skills".

Absolutely full recommended for everyone interested to improve their English communication skills.This is a high level course, perfectly developed, structured and elaborated, direct and clear to understand.I'm deeply pleased and happy with my new learning.
The classes what you have given, and the assignements what you have conducted are really good , and easy for understanding all the things and its quite interesting to prepare for assignments. Thank you very much mam.  I have finished all the assignments and all the reviews according to the course requirements pls try to provide certificate on time mam.

I would say that the things which i gained through this course can not be expressed in words, its a feel. Even though i want to comment that, through this course i am now making myself coming out of the box while standing in a crowd(i.e, public speaking). This course made me learn, how to give a presentation in an effective and interesting manner. And special thanks to the mentor of Georgia Tech University and Cousera platform which has made this course available.
This course seemed excellent to me, it gave me excellent tools to start more efficient conversations in English.
I think that the reviews of the assignments of the other classmates help us to improve the way we listen to the language in non-native people, which I think is very useful since not all of us speak English and it also helps us to improve it when speaking .
Thank you very much and congratulations to all who successfully completed this course.
Very helpful,the instructor is very good.The way she talks is too much friendly.It will help a non native-English speaker like me to improve his/her pronunciation.Now i have a idea about pitch,elevator talk which i have never had.How to talk professionally,giving a effective interview with a confidence was also good lesson for me.I am really thankful to Coursera and  obviously to my University who gave me this great opportunity.
Thank you for this course! Initially it seemed simple, but it had lovely subtle nuances, that where very new for me. Also, I learned some tips from peer reviewing. Overall, if one has enough discipline to push oneself, this course is helpful. Of course one can be lazy too - but then one won't learn much, and to take this course just to pass it - it's not worth it. You have to put your heart into it and you will learn a lot!

I'd like to commend the creator/s of this course. I definitely learned a lot on improving my skill in speaking English professionally. My recommendation is to give more sample and exercises for this course in the future. All in all, Good Job!
This course is great but I do not think it's ok to make non-English speakers of English speak English like English people. We have our accents and it's OK for it to be that way. We can't speak English perfectly; in terms of pronunciations.
I truly enjoyed learning how to communicate more effectively in different professional scenarios. The videos kept me engaged and gave me valuable information. Thanks to Georgia Tech for offering this online course with such high standards.
I have really enjoyed to take this course and got to know more information about my second language which is English. I have gained a new knowledge about pronunciation, professional listening and having a productive business conversation.
The professors are great and the idea of the curse too, they help you with the starting chat and through the personal introduction but i would like it to go a little bit further because professional discussions are more than basic phrases
Very good course... It was really useful to know about word stress and rising and falling tones.. And pronunciation of words ending with - ed & - es   et cetera.. Simple and easy to understand. Save the videos for future references.
This course is very useful to me as I need to communicate with my students fluently ,effectively.The course instructor is so skilful  and explained very good. thanks to the Georgia Institute of Technology and the course instructor.
I recoomend this course, I really like it. I learned a lot of new things so for me it was very helpful, I am not a native of the United States and this helped me to better understand how to improve my pronunciation and intonation.
Brief, to the point, and very useful tips for enhancing your professional language skills so quickly. I never thought this to be so easy but I really appreciate the simplicity of presentation to learn very novel skills.Many Thanks
The lecturers were super calm when they are explaining, the course itself use many direct practice using audio, and it helps me listen to my own pronunciation and review using others feedback on my assignments. Thank you so much!
Great course, provided with some basic knowledge and skills to improve communication skills. Highly recommend it. Thanks to the instructor for easy learning and Coursera for providing such a great platform to enhance your skills.
