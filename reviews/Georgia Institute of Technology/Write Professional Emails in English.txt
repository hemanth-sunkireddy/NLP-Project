Course is OK but some items are explained like students were "baby's"....... I really do not like that others classmates have to correct my work because they put incorrect remarks. They think that they have the correct answer when they are making themselves mistakes.  I made the subscription thinking it was a high level .... So course quite good (but lower intermediate level) but really bad organized.
checking assignment is not proper. If other learners not checked properly and I failed or get a very low grade  than this is not my mistake. As  due to less time many learners do not check proper.
addressed to scholars (to whom who goes to school).addressed mostly for US-target (introduction e-mails, W3, for instance) takes more time (than 2-3 times), than it worths: W4 and W5 give obviouse information.technically the course builds perfect, but:1) it seems that promotion is grater goal than learning;2)  I'm wondering if Coursera could targeting courses by format, micro-nano-neutrino purpose, age, skills, level of presence of theoretical matherial, cultural - general - domestic skills, knowlages or even entertainment-vines-look-like-couses etc.Coursera gives great courses description (far more better than edx), but in 50% cases it didn't help. Yes, I can unenroll in any moment, but sometimes you understand it very late (when you have completed 1/3 of a course) and etc. And after you confused, and the confusion from behavioural fields (needs strong recommendationsabout cours termination). The cours exploration and desision making (learn - do not learn) takes quite a lot of time. I'm of cource understand what "Write Professional Emails in English" cours is a  part. Part of Specialisation!!! How it may named "Specialisation"?!!! Even the titles looks very attractive. thank you for distance learning and content!!!
Way too elementary.
Sadly, this course is at the high school level at the most. Very disappointing to see it listet here as a university course.
You can't do the assignments unless you pay the subscription. The founding idea of MOOCs was to make education more accesible. How do you test your knowledge if you can't submit assignments? I understand paying for a certificate, but I don't want the certificate.
Lots of spiteful people who will lower your grades on purpose will be reviewing your peer graded assignments. So prepare to resubmit a stupid order cancellation email 3 or 4 times, because some 3rd-worlders will not give you the points you deserved. The sweet part is that you can't do anything about it, you can't contest their review.
such funny mistakes !!!!I finished the course since 7 days, Cant download or see my certificate, always the message as below Attempted to fetch PDF but got the following errors:Could not find signature for instructor Suzi Lee. Please notify the Instructor to upload one.for me I have to hit the roof and the system now !!!!
It's been a week since I completed the course and yet I am able to download the certificate. I have contacted the support via chat three times and still, they are not able to resolve the issue. They are very fast at collecting the course fee, but not bothered about resolving the issue of the participants.
I have a problem in downloading my certificatePlease check my problem as fast as possible.... üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Great course, but at one point, isn't a quiz about culture different between high-context and low-context style promoting a stereo type to the people in the both cultures? I thought so because I am an Asian, but I did not ever see such email from my workers in the U.S. to anybody in my office.EDIT: Even if you complete the course, coursera keeps the course status in progress rather than complete, then they will take your money out from your wallet. I will ask coursera over this issue. However, I hope they will not wipe away my activities I have done.
Very low material not enough examples ( full emails)
i don't lik it .
—Ö—É–π–Ω—è
Unless you're completely new to Mails and English as a language, I wouldn't recommend this course
I just complete my course as write professional emails in english but I could not download the certificate.There show an error-https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/NYZX8GVCJPNZ
There are lots of bugs while submitting and reviewing of assignments and also the course is not interesting.I try to unenroll myself from course but it again creates problem.
No hablo ingl√©s y este curso no tiende subt√≠tulos al espa√±ol. Lamentable, por eso no podr√© hacer el curso
So basic. The teacher speaks to you like if you're a baby, It's very annoying
Hi, I am Hina-Fatima, and I learn so my thing through this course
inscripcion por error de la plataforma.
I'm not interested in this course
very bad...time wasted
The name of the course should be: How to write BASIC Professional Emails in English. The instructions and assignments are very basic. You can complete every week in 30 minutes. The assignments are reviewed by students who don't speak proper English, but who are rating your assignment and cannot give any feedback on how to improve your emails. This course is a waste of your money!
This course contains quite some useful information, but overall it seems way too simple. Most of what it talked about were the basics and what common high school students would know. It could be much better if its depth could be made higher.
Geared towards ESL students. I had signed up thinking it was for native English speakers, but it was more of a English 101.
it is good for non-English native speaker. + it is not free.i liked most the additional material.
i cant ale to get review of extent my timeline bad experiencehelp me in solving it
It was a good course, but the material and the details it covered were very short.
The course is great however we have to pay to get all tasks or a certificated
review part was not good. it took a long time to get review my assignment
Good for basic introduction to email.
So so .......it's not well organized.
Many rules are way out of date.
Brief and accurate course. It provides useful information for writing professional emails. It¬¥s a pity that the free version does not include assignments and peer¬¥s review.
Hello Mr. Landers.I think that it is a good course. I appreciate the your effort.But if you allow me a constructive criticism:   - I don¬¥t like a course that I am navegated to other web sites. I prefer a course in wich all contents are original.   - Adicitonaly, I would like to coment that I have taken several courses by the University of Pensylvania for free. I could complete these courses; even the qualified assesments. I didn't get a certificated, but I could make all the exercices.Despite what I have said before, I recommend the course.Whith best regards.Jorge Melchor G√≥mez
Thank you very much for helpful tips during this course. It is a very good course for people, who is fluent in English. Most of the people enrolled in course didn't speak English, and didn't understand assignments. In description it says learners should be intermediate level in English, but people do not realize what intermediate level is in different countries. It would be helpful to include pretest for people who wants to enroll, so they don't waste their time. Most of the people need to learn basic English grammar first, then do this course.
The course is very basic, but very well explained. I really enjoyed the videos. It took me about 8 hours to complete the course. What I didn't enjoy was the peer review format, for the written homework. I wished the instructors would review the homework and provide useful advice. It was odd to get my homework graded by someone with a poorer English level than mine.
Sometimes you don't know when the next lesson starts and I feel you don't also notice the feedback section to review others.  I thought I was finished to find out I was still waiting on reviews.  The flow could be much better and not dependant on others scoring you.
The curs give a good overview, how to write official emails. Somtimes the evaluator are not so friendly and gave bad votes without a reason. It will be apassably vocabulary assumed. All in all, it is a good curs, to bringing back the asics.
Writing Professional  Emails in English course is very helpful it teach you how to write professionally  learn you the basic emails also learn you to write announcements emails and apologize  emails.
Course material is fine for the subject, the more problematic part is the way its graded, with 5 peer reviewed assignments. Especially the first one which is quite tedious for the participants.
Professional communication should be clear, correct, and effective. The course has helped me to improve these skills. Congratulations to everyone who took this challenge.
Course 1: I believe it was oversimplified. There is very limited information provided by the instructor in a very slow manner.
A little more geared towards speakers whose English is an additional language. Some useful pointers throughout though!
Great teacher, although I would rather need more examples of elaborate emails, that I could use at work.Thank you!
THE ASSIGNMENTS SHOULDN'T BE PEER-GRADED. IT SHOULD RATHER BE MENTOR GRADED AND THAT WOULD SAVE TIME A LOT.
It's completed, right? Otherwise, how can I rate it? But why the status still shows in-progress?
It's a simple but useful course, however, it's really hard to get your assignment peer-graded.
Unfortunately we can not submit our tasks with do Un upgrade in our account.
Good course.Get basic idea about email writing.Thankyou
The course is good, but there no slides in Power Point
Nothing really interesting, but hi and low cultures.
Sir,your ideia about the email drafting is excellent
Clear and essenzial focus on the main aspects
Entry level for writing English emails.
I have learnt in an organised way .
Good content, feels very automated
It's a good opportunity to learn.
I felt the course is very basic.
Satisfactory but cam be better
Muy claro y bien estructurado.
It was a really good course
A good course. Thank you.
This,course was so good
Up to mark content
Only brief course.
Great Time Killer
I think it's better to give us more example and explain some kinds of methods.
Very informative course! Could see the drastic improvement in my email writing after every lesson. Appreciate the additional materials to read up after the lesson as well.The only gripe I have is that there are too many peer-graded assignments. There are instances where they do not grade assignments accurately, leading to unnecessary loss of marks. I believe it will be fairer if we can report/feedback the peer-graded assignment comments.
Learning course
Helpful course.
helpful course.
what a course!
a little easy
Tr√®s bon cours. Il y a plusieurs exemples et le cours trace l'essentiel √† savoir que nous n'apprenons pas √† l'√©cole.J'aurai bien aim√© avoir plus d'exemples de phrases types que l'on peut √©crire dans des emails. De plus, je pense que le cours pourrait √™tre donn√© en seulement 2-3 s√©ances. Pas besoin d'autant de vid√©o et de 5 semaines pour apprendre √† √©crire un email en anglais. J'ai pass√© une journ√©e enti√®re √† regarder les vid√©os. Cela prend beaucoup de temps alors que je pense qu'il aurait √©t√© possible de le faire en 2h si tout √©tait expliqu√© dans une seule vid√©o. Je remercie tout de m√™me grandement Gerry Landers, votre cours m'a beaucoup appris et m'aidera pendant de nombreuses ann√©es. Merci beaucoup !
I think this course is overall helpful and of high quality. I've learned a lot and found most of the content conducive to my career development. However, as to the assignments, I tried my best to finish the writing assignment for week 1, but still failed. I don't agree with some reviewers comments that I didn't use the punctuations right and I didn't write a subject. I hope there could be some coordinators with necessary skills and background knowledge to make sure the scores are more professional and objective. Maybe they could help exclude too subjective comments and ratings. Thanks.
This is a very interactive course for non-native English learner. I have been benefited from this course. I learned how to express myself professionally at the time of email writing. The pedagogy, in fact, is highly effective to instill the required skills for drafting a precise, concise,  clear and simultaneously comprehensive email. Therefore, I recommend this course for beginners to improve and hone their skills so that they could write impressively and effectively.
Our teacher Gerry Landers has come up with easy to watch and digestible videos, that make this course excellent to improve our English written communications skills no matter our level of English. One of the worst experiences is the review system of the course. Some students  will give you an unfair low score which is not backed up with an explanation nor following instructions. That is not professional.
I have loved this course as Respected Gerry Landers explains everything considering various aspects. I have surely improved on being a professional email writer. Most important attribute of this course is that it has really helpful links in the ADDITIONAL RESOURCES section after each lesson.Thank you  Professor Gerry Landers and Coursera!
O curso √© √≥timo! Aprendemos muitas coisas e temos a possibilidade de melhorar a escrita. Contudo, apenas acredito que o curso, ao propor as suas atividades, elas deveriam ser corrigidas por professores, al√©m dos alunos do curso. Sugiro isso, porque n√£o ficamos esperando outros alunos corrigirem nossos exerc√≠cios.
When I am trying to get my certification I get the following error:"Attempted to fetch PDF but got the following errors:Could not find signature for instructor Suzi Lee. Please notify the Instructor to upload one."How Could I fix it Please?Contact me in my email " engsalehhassira97@gmail.com".
The professor is clear and his kindness comes through in his smile and demeanor. I was hoping this course to be a bit more advanced. I would have prefered a clear indication of the level this is for. I got good information but I would have like to have gotten even more out of it
I liked this course. There are a lot of useful information. It's well-structured and includes a lot of examples. A moment I didn't like is locked assignments. In my opinion, it's ok when you can't get a certificate without payment but I can't see a reason for practice lock.
This is a useful course which is highly applicable at work. Thank you Professor Gerry for designing and instructing such a great course. I just wished the link to the reading material still worked. I did flag Professor Gerry that error, and he referred me to Coursera.
I think professor speaking rate is a little bit fast but appropriate to catch the main meaning. The assessments are great and effective but little to do. The contents are useful, practical and medium in difficulty. I hope this course will be more detail in future.
Dear Landers,Thank you very much for all your time that serve to us, and to teach as writing professional emails in English. I am really appreciated of you fully supports and kindness.I hope I could take some other classes of you in coursera.Best,Faqiri.
Very nice and very helpful course. It will surely help the people living in the 3rd world and is not fully aware of writing a professional email. One can surely learn many things from this course. This is one of the best and helpful courses in coursera.
I learned very good tips from this course and have certainly noticed my emails improve. The reason for a missing star is the peer review. While I enjoyed this feature a lot, I would have preferred to have at least one instructor review and feedback.
I think the peer grating delay the process to finish this course.  Generally it is good for people don't know how to write the business email, but if you have working experience in the U.S. already, I suggest to choose other high leveled courses.
The course is very well organised and effective. The instructor is master at the subject, too. I have been improved my writing skill since I pursued in this course. Many thanks to Coursera as well as The Georgia Institute of Technology.
This course teach us basic knowledges about writing emails. Such knowledges are essential to get success in a right communication. Many times we forget them and committed various silly mistakes unnecessarily.It's an excellent course.
Wonderful course for improving and framing a professional email. It covers do's and don'ts, phrases  to write in different kinds of mail like introduction, announcement, request or apology mails. Also, culture differences was great.
Great instructor and well organized online course. Title a bit misleading as this is the very basics and thus implication of improving  writing skills for professional e-mails seems not be the perfect fit.  A nice re-fresher though!
Very nicely created, short and simple videos makes it easy to understand. Mr. Gerry Landers is also very good communicator plus interaction is done every week through assignments which is very beneficial for practical knowledge.
This course is wonderful for those who improve their email writing skills. But,the Almost all links provided in Addition Resources is not working  showing error 404. Please check and update them. Thank you Sir Mr.Landers
I liked the course very much. Now I can confidently write any email for any culture for my profession.  But getting review from others was not effective in my term as I think they didn't read properly before reviewing.
This course is just a shallow foundation for mail writings. There is no doubt about the the content and the representation of the content. It's my personal thought that the course may have more depth than what it has.
The course Write Professional Email in English is very much important for the professional world. Coursera is given an opportunity for us to learn how to write a professional email in  English. it is best coursera.
A very light course. The instructor is nice and gives very lucid explanations. I don't have any complains but one. The number of tests aren't enough to give you a strong hold over the concepts taught in class.
Very good course. Full of useful details. Only thing is at times Mr. Landers was uncomfortable in front of the camera and that made me uncomfortable too. Other than that it was pretty good. Thank you,Teo.
I found the course useful but I do not seem able to obtain my certificate due to missing one deadline and there does not seem to be an option to contact anyone about it, which is frustrating
it was really a nice course. I have really improved in email writing and can tackle different situations in email.Thank you, Coursera and Georgia Tech for this wonderful course
Making students review their tests is somewhat unproductive
He puts the students in a pressure that may not be reviewed by one of their tests, delaying completion of the course
The course is well-designed. However, it is not for fluent English speakers. Most assignments are graded by peers, and some of them may be low graders or provide no feedback.
I'm very happy to complete this course. i have learned so many things by doing this course such as how to write professional letters and communication skill through English.
Very well presented, the subtitles are good, some of the quiz questions have excessive spacing between questions and answers (a minor area for improvement in presentation).
It was really great and useful course> i have learnt a lot of how you erite emails and too many informations i recived. thanks for your this good material, i apprciate it
The content is appropriate for beginners.  In my opinion, the instructions for assignments are not clear enough.  Perhaps because it's my first day learning this course.
A good insight on how to write formal email, student may gain basic knowledge on the expectations of writing professional emails within and outside of the organization.
It's the most important course I have ever completed online. It was realy a great course.I would thank coursera and Georgia Tech institute for their efforts.
Pretty good course. Easy and simple, yet, full of information. I'd recommend it for high school students or college students who aren't so good at English
Some of the peers tend to put 0 without any reason no matter what. They keep spamming 0 in all sections. This hampers the true meaning of those tasks.
This is the best online platform to improve our knowledge. It's gives us the opportunity to learn Many things. Had a good experience in this Coursera
I really enjoy the lecture. However,I expected to learn more about english expression or example sentence that i can use in the email from the video.
This course is very good because it is very clear. Nonetheless, I'm a bit disappointed that one have to purchase the course in order to complete it.
This course helps me write professional emails in English. Thi course is designed very well and I strongly recommend my colleague to join and learn
I have completed "Write Professional Emails in English" course from coursera. Amazing part of this course is how emails effects different cultures.
Absolutely Nice Course , I got to learn a lot from this . Now I can write a well organised effective mail to anyone.Thanks a lot for this course..
I think content can be richer since I have experience about writing business emails. However, overall it was very useful and I learnt new things.
Nice course. But it was too basic if there was something like more unique like how to write job emails etc. it would have been more interesting.
The course was very good. The teaching the instructor was very good and concepts were pretty easy to understand as the courses is well designed
This practical course gives me various skills to write a professional email in English.Therefore I can make use of this ability in my work.
Clear, useful and with several practical examples. I especially enjoyed the list of additional resources I can keep consulting over time.
Excelent course, educational and, excelent tools to write a proper professional emails in English.I learned new and usefull vocabulary.
This course was really awesome  and intresteing very easy to understand and we can learn how write an email perfecly and proffesionaly
This course is really useful for the people pursuing job. It really helps you to enhance your communication in your job environment.
It's very good course for everyone to learn all about the mail writing, I really enjoyed this. Once again thanks to Coursera team.
Just the basics, it would be a 5-star if there were more examples, especially updating how to address people using or not gender.
This course was perfect .I learned very important information .Thank you for giving me this chance and thanks for your effort.
Thank you for the wonderful inputs which are going to help me write professional emails in an academic and professional life.
I am very pleased with this course. It helped me to improve my email writing skills in a precise way. Thanks, Coursera team.
En general el curso estuvo muy bien y completo. Ser√≠a muy positivo que todos los videos estuviesen subtitulados en Espa√±ol.
Helpful Course. very good Instructor, Easy to understand, Clear information, Good assignment and very good links extension.
I liked this course and teacher. I learned enough interesting and useful information. Unfortunately, this course is paid.
I like this course because it's an essential review of basical points that you should know to write  emails successfully.
Got Excellent knowledge from this course about professional email I would like to gain more knowledge from Georgia Tech.

This course easily addresses the differences and etiquette of various emails in the global work culture.
This course is very important one for the fresh graduates for increasing their chance for getting a job.
Good material, would be helpful to have more feedback of the course staff regarding assignment's issues.
It is a wonderful course, me got lot of new ideas while we write emails especially Professional Emails.
There is some technical issues in the assignments and some peers are not being fair in their reviews.
The course is kind of shorter than I expected. It is recommended to finish the course within 2 weeks.
Very much interesting. I have learnt a lot of things. In one word I would like to say is "EFFICIENT".
It is very well organized course. Have proper structure, easy to undersatnd language. User friendly.
course is well structured and efficiently designed to enhance the communication skill of pedestrian.
Overall the course is good. But, the peer-graded system was the most  annoying part in this course.
This course allowed me to learn new things and I think the course is too short. It's really useful!

Gerry Landers, the course instructor, is a true professional of the field. What's more, he is the Teacher. I'm not exaggerating, he is the Teacher in nature. He explains everything in such a manner that everything gets straight to the skill level of unconscious mind, and you, as a student, are able to momentarily use that information in your everyday work.Also, I'd love to mention here the brilliant team work that has developed the way of delivering the knowledge as effectively. Shootings, changing backgrounds, wallpapers, headlines, sound, slides, bullet points, voice instructions combined with simultaneous written information - to say the demeanor is perfect would be a great understatement. I can judge, since I've successfully lived through quite a number of courses not only on Coursera but also on Edx and have a lot to compare with.I want to thank all of you, professionals, for such a delivery. And I strongly recommend every person anything interested in writing to join the course "Write Professional Emails in English" with Mr. Gerry Landers. Join the course unhesitatingly because it is worth finishing.

Certainly knowledge gained from this course is going to improve my email writing technique.Thanks again.Best wishes,Taslim ArifXyz

It's an amazing course. I recommend this course to everyone. I can tell you from my experience that before attending this course I knew very few things about email writing but after completing it I have gained confidence in writing professional emails. Even if you know nothing about email writing, after completing this course you will be able to write any kind of email. I am really thankful to Mr. Landers, Georgia tech. and Coursera for providing such an amazing course. Thanks a lot.
Mr. Landers thank you for your course. I can advice this course to everyone.I would like to mention the three most important elements when I would be writing professional e-mails: 1) read and check before sending an e-mail, 2) the e-mail should have the following sections intro, development, and conclusion, 3) and be brief and clear. Last the best advice that I received was to keep my own language when I write an e-mail. This make the e-mail communication an authentic one.
I have learned a lot from Coursera and grateful for my tutor and other mentors. Thank you Georgina Institute of Technology. I would recommend so many friends, family members to study online using Coursera site. This course has benefited me so much, I have corrected all the errors I would make while writing and replying emails. Looking forward to learning another course from this site. May the Lord bless you abundantly. Thank You! Best regards, Kanji Christine.
This course was helpful for me and I guess it would also be helpful for a couple of colleagues coming from 20 different countries. I felt a little bit unhappy not to know how peer reviews are selected that were offered to me. On the other hand I had to wait for necessary peer reviews even if I reviewed a lot more than needed. It might be a good idea to give those a prefereble chance to get a review that do a lot of peer reviews for others.
How interesting was the experience to learn the professional Email writing skills. After taking this course, it has increased my confidence in writing email. I appreciate your  way of teaching and knowledge. It has enhanced my knowledge and capacity, and now i'm looking forward to resume my office again after the lock down situation, which i hope would come to an end soon.Wishing best of luck to you and your team!Sumbal Salamat
I enjoyed this course, classes are short and  they go straight to the point. Attention never falls. I have "taken away" many tips to improve the way in which I write my professional emails. Very interesting., very useful. I strongly recommend it. Last, but not least, the peer's reviewing assignments lead learners to engage, making efforts to express theirselves  meeting people of different cultures. Five stars!

Thank you very much. The course is a good source for Speakers of other languages and for anyone interested in writing better emails.  I now tend to look at my emails twice (even three times) before sending.

Thank youMaria Barreto
