Shortly: I don't know why I paid for this course.Just a list of stuff. I know that it isn't easy teach what the SC is, but in a online (international) course I totally don't care abut the US code of transportations or at what age in US it is possible lead a truck. And these are just a coupple of things.About the tests: above all, too long, and often with a lot of questions that hasn't been exposed in lectures.Finally, I put one star because I can't put zero.
I guess the narration by Mr Brown was just pathetic. The way he spoke during the entire videos makes me highly suspicious that he was the designer of this course. I am sure he can do better.
The Peer Graded Assignment is not a proper way to Judge .Which resulted me about a month to finish this single Assignment, So these module should be removed.--- A well-wisher//
this course may be ok content wise, but the pc part is  bad,   the course is locked and you dont provide tech support.  I would not recommend this vendor ever.
No one proofed this course. All of the readings are sloppy and thrown together, questions on the quizzes are blatantly wrong and a few of them have no correct answer, or the answers conflict directly with the reading material. It did cover a lot but the quality is low. Someone should go through and correct the reading material and the quizzes.
The answers to the quiz questions were not available in the videos we have been seeing for days. and the instructor was just literally reading out the script so the lessons became very boring and discouraging. and the last quiz was totally based on the US laws so it was not of any help for foreign students like us. after giving the quiz i ended up finding the answers in the optional section which comes after giving the quiz. so i faced a lot of hurdle while answering the quiz.
way too general
The way of teaching is very dull and uninteresting !

The professor teaching has a very uninteresting style and appears as if he is just reading a script from a screen in front rather than explaining concepts as they come.

I was running back and forth between the reading material and video since he was just reading what is written on the slide. It could have been better if he was talking to us and explaining his view on the terms.

Anyways, I am done with the Course and I hope other upcoming courses will be better.
The course has a wide variety of class material and concepts, tests are long and memory oriented (absolutely memory oriented, you must pick the exact same definition as in the provided material). The professor basically limits his participation to reading the material and just that. It is hard to follow him and well, it is basically like an audio book, a very long and boring one.
The speaker/lecturer should have more engaged (instead of just reading the scripts) and explained succinctly, instead of lengthy sentences that many times did not make sense. The quiz emphasized too much on theory and terminologies.
I just felt he just read the script all the time.
Content is good. But instructor's presentation could be better, and slides are not well employed.
The quiz questions are focused on rules in USA. Totally useless for people learning in other coun
Reading material is good. Videos are not much helpful. Low value addition by the trainer himself. Some analytical or statistical techniques which may help the management in decision making might be more helpful.
Lot of focus on theoretical class room style knowledge and learning
The course was very informative and was good for understanding overall Supply chain and different functions of it. However, videos didn't cover all the reading material. And it was more like reading a book about the supply chain than going through a course. each week included on average a 30-page pdf which surprisingly only 10 minutes was assigned for it!!! It would have been better if the videos were covering the reading material. Thanks!
Very basic. Loads of materials to read and understand. The quiz and the lessons don't have anything in common. You will see a complete different set of questions which is not related to the lessons taken. Overall the course is more theoretical and less in practical or numbers.
This course is mostly focuses around US transportation ecosystem and does not show enough light on concepts for students who are accessing it from outside US. Overall it was a good learning for basics in supply chain
The material in the reading and the lecture did not always go together.  The test included somethings from both the reading and the lecture.
A bit difficult to understand and some quiz questions not related to the video lectures of that week. Overall good course
The instructor was not engaging and was simply reading the material. That method didn't help.
The teaching method could have been more interesting.
how can  a peer graded assignment will hold your
good information but dull
An overall wonderful compact introduction to supply chain and its various concepts. I feel confident to speak about these areas with supply chain professionals now and understand that much of the concepts are straightforward but knowing the language that professionals use is important. At times the speaker makes mistakes which do become increasingly frustrating as time goes on. A simple second take would have helped to address this issue. The final quiz - question 18 should have an answer for Ocean and Air but it is not one of the answers. Overall recommended for the effort-reward ratio.
The content gave a good overview of the frameworks and different components involved in supply chain. From models for understanding overall processes to exploration of different modes of transportation. Don't expect a great deal of detail, although you will be introduced to key terminology and calculations. The presenter is knowlegable, paces himself well and easy to listen. My only suggestions would be for some of the more detailed slides to stay on the screen for longer, and have the links to videos clickable within Coursera.
In general, this is a very good course as it provides a comprehensive view of supply chain principles.Being the upper side of this course the good orderly structure used to present the concepts and the good supporting reading material, while the downsize is the poor quality of the videos, as these are too short, excessively summarising the concepts and poorly presented by Tim Brown (maybe he was in a hurry going somewhere else?), hence, preventing the learner yielding the full potential this course can offer.
As a practitioner in Supply Chain I found this course very helpful for anyone involved in logistics or supply chain to have a big picture of what Supply Chain is.  For practitioners currently working in one area of the supply chain is difficult to know what they other areas do and how they impact the entire supply chain.  This course clarifies the different areas and how you can work and make an impact in each one of the areas.
The course contents were organized in a well structured manner covering over 5 weeks.The content delivery by the faculty and the standard of quiz were excellent. Improvement can be done to make the course more interactive like live chats etc .Gained many value additions on personal as well as professional front from this courseThank you Tim and the whole team
The course lacked sustantial involvement, I never felt any forum participation needs and there where not enough homeworks. The content was great for a giving a broad idea of what a Supply Chain is, however, I woul've liked to have much more practical examples as well as anecdotes rom the professor to better understand the topics viewed.
A well formulated course addressing the key phases of supply chain as weekly modules.Quizzes at the end of each module test the learner pretty well. There seems to be a feeling of hurry while explaining few concepts in some of the modules and this derails learner's journey in understanding the material to the fullest.
Reading material is very good and in detail. I found the videos not much helpful. It would be a better experience if more practical examples were given by the trainer. Some analytical or statistical techniques which may help the management in decision making would have been more helpful.
A very good course. Can help you in deciding if you want to take Supply Chain as your profession.  The only thing I thought could have been better is if the course could tell you what kind of skills you will need for each department (example coding and analytics skills for planning etc.)
The information given very usefull, those who are new to the supply chain work, it is very helpfull to understand and adopt the supply chain principle daily routing of the work with concern supply chain team.  Notes about supply chain principle given widely and understand manner.
It was a good course to go through. The content was crisp and to the point. Also reading material before every week starting is lengthy but useful. It gives idea of what is going to come in week lessons. So a good technique, learners should also come well prepared. Nice one.
The course gives an indepth understanding of the complete supply chain principles. It is very useful for all who are already part of the supply chain and will help then to improve on the  current area of work as well encourages to explore other areas in this field.
The course materials provided were great but the video lectures weren't that engaging. I mean it was all serious type 'reading the transcript' video lecture. Although, one can take this course for the study materials it provides, those are really impressive.
Course quality is satisfactory and materials are informative. Particularly, reading materials are richer than videos. Videos are covering general information, but if you want to learn detailed and pass quizzes, you have to study reading materials.
Tim does a great job leading learners through the ins and outs of Supply Chain Principles. In the class i felt it covered what i was looking for to become more familiar with Supply Chain. Would recommend for anyone interested to take the course.
It was really a good experience..it was all about how goods flow from the step of manufacturing till the goods are transported. Each and every topic are well explained in a broader way. It was amazing and very useful for my career also.
The reading materials were helpful. Although I questioned sometimes if they weren't just pulled straight from the Government grant provided materials themselves (Developed by LINCS in Supply Chain Management Consortium).
Thanks for Coursera of introducing a SCM course with expert (Mr.TImothyM Brown) lectures and notes, which refreshed our  ideas and learned new terminlogy,principles,concepts,methology  involved in our department in SCM.
The content is pretty good, but the teacher constantly reads and doesn't explain a lot of concepts beyond of what's in the slide.Usually the pdf at the start of each module is better than the videos themselves.
the quiz questions do not match the video and but is based on reading material. the reading material is long and the points on it are the once’s s to be taught on the video. the video lecture is dragged.
The length of the videos are very less and reading material is too lengthy which causes loss of interest. The reading material is very nice and it gives broad view of different parts of supply chain.
In general it's a good course, however, the quiz has many theoretical questions that you can search in books or other sources, my suggestion is to be more practical and bring more company examples.
Detailed explanation and extra readings, suitable for beginners. But the quiz towards the end of the course are not very helpful and some answers are not anywhere in the videos or extra readings.
Great content, actually more broad than would have expected of a certificate course. Only one concern, all examples and guidelines shared are of the United States yet course is open to all
This was a good course but the thing i found deviating was that in the quiz sometimes the questions were facts that were not mentioned anywhere .However it is a great learning experience.
The course had enough contents to study and to learn.Also since they are very practically related, it was easy to grasp the concept and connect to practical things.
Is a beginner course, so i recommend to use easier terms to explain the topics. You got a lot of international students, that english is not their native language.
you need to elaborate more info to your students. however, it was a great experience to learn from your institution. i wish i can learn more from your institute.
The course is very relevant to Industrial/Operations/Management professionals. Thanks a lot to the instructor (Prof. Timothy M Brown) for designing the course.
nice introduction to domain of supply chain engineering to give broader perspective. course gives a good theoretical background for learner to specialize.
Wide view on supply chain - very interesting and complete - highly recommendWould have appreciated more examples and exercise on stack calculation models
This course help me to understand the basic fundamentals of supply chain and also gives information on how a individual department work in supply chain.
the course was great and had fun doing it.....but it would be more easy if the way the lectures were given could be in more understanding way...
the reader/learner is able to read and understand the proper and efficient use of supply chain priciples day 2 day life and in job purpose too.
Very informative but it felt like the instructor was just reading the slides. It would be better if the style of teaching was more interactive.
Excellent! Very much informative course. Only Last week session was more specific to the US, would have been great if it is general or global.
It is a very good composition of lectures for beginners. It would be more interesting by connecting lectures with the course material
the course give a good view for the supply chain, it is good for beginner to intermediate i will engage the course again as a review
The only disadvantage is that there is not enough maths. to learn us how to calculate the different factors the course talk about.
Good enough content but it requires atleast double the amount of time to be invested every week to go along with the schedule.
This course enables to learn the basic of SC. It's very interesting and stimulating. I'll definitely go on with Georgia Tech.
It really gives a good intro, but the course is not at depth. But it covered so many bases i felt. Definitely a good start.
Good cours i would like to see more of the incoterms, and i think the week 5 information could be teached before thats all.
i really enjoy this course. its my best so far on the coursera platform. and i'm looking forward to getting endorsements.
Good course but a lot of slide reading rather than additional comments. The transcripts were not always available either.
Lengthy topics, more assignments would have been better for creating interest. Other than that everything is fine.
It is a great course. It involves all the outlines required to be covered to know the basics of supply chain.
Great to understand basic Supply Chain concepts. Good start for a beginner with no experience in the filed.
The course can be more beneficial if the instructor had explained more the technical business terms.
This is an Excellent Course offered by Coursera to Enhance the Technical and Operational Skills..
The readings are very similar to what the exhibitor explains. I would suggest more case studies.
Very easy to understand the course.  It gives a holistic view on the supply chain principles
Program gave a Broad & detailed Insight on SCM Principles. All the best for future programs
Learned a lot from Mr. Brown about supply chain. Will be definitely helpful in the future.
Simple and Easy to Understand.Covered all aspects of Supply chain management in detail.

I am glad that I took this course, I've been working as a procurement and supply manager for 10 years , but with experience. but now that I completed this course that really made everything logical to me I can say that I have a certificate plus my 10 years experience.
This was a pretty well described course which describes how the supply chain works as a whole. It surely made an impact on me and the knowledge would be surely useful to me. Thank you
This was a phenomenal course!  I am an executive at a logistics company where we specialize in 3PL and transportation, both LTL and TL.  This course gave me a wonderful overview of the entire Supply Chain and it is quite informative.  I will be taking ALL of Georgia Tech's online certifications involving Supply Chain and can't wait for the next course.  Thank you Professor Brown for solid presentation of material.  Greatly appreciated, I will require several of my employees to take this course also.
I appreciate the course content and methodology for teaching on line. Every participant along with the class and Quiz. should prepare their own notes with their industry examples along with power point presentations will further enhance the learning. Since i am working in Demand planning and customer contact. This course is very useful.  This is my first on line course. Very happy and i will continue to learn.

Excellent overview of the Supply Chain. Provides a great foundation for those who are interested in the field, just starting out in the field, or those with some experience and want to understand how their role fits in the overall supply chain.
My first ever course on coursera. I have completed it. The presenter is good and so is the content. I wished if the presenter had given examples from his own working career. Its always fun to listen to peoples experiences on the subject matter.
This course is very good to understand the full cycle of supply chain management. It covers all the steps from planning or procurement to end customers. By this course we can learn new things which give new ideas about SCM.
A fine walk through of Supply Chain, clear videos supported by sound documentation.  I recommend this course
The course offers a very high level but good break up of the systems , the process and people involved in Supply chain , the 5 weeks are split well to manage the various layers/ Tiers on the process. the complexities of implementation and the details of each fork in the process will be more advanced including what is the data to capture and the schema of the business objects in system and EDI , but this information serves as foundation. Enjoyed the course and test / grading process. Knowing this we can proceed into process re-engineering, system automation , IoT in Supply chain and Blockchain and smart contract use cases, which will help modernize and improve the process speed and visibility with minimum errors due to limited human intervention. Thank you - Georgia Tech for putting this course online.
A great course that provides knowledge about every aspect of Supply Chain. I am going to study Supply Chain Management in a few months and this course has given me all the knowledge I need to have an advantage in my upcoming studies. Specifically, the videos are of great quality and provide detailed information. In addition, the reading materials are very important, have a lot of details and you can learn lots of things about SCM. Last but not least, every week's quiz is a nice way to sharpen your knowledge about every aspect of Supply Chain.
Quite Cumbersome and at times a bit difficult to take all of it in.However, I've found this course to be  very interesting and it's picked my interest in learning more about Supply Chain. I've gotten a better understanding of the production flow, distribution process involved and the significant role technology plays in improving these processes. The knowledge gained will certainly help me to improve my business and possibly seek future employment in related fields.Best wishes to Timothy Brown!
It was an excellent course delivered by Professor Timothy M Brown. It gave me an in depth knowledge of the Supply Chain Principles including the Warehousing Operations, Manufacturing Processes, Transportation Operations undertaken in a Supply Chain domain. This course will surely help me in a better understanding of the advanced Supply Chain Courses that I will be undertaking during my Masters. I would like to collaborate with Professor Brown in the future on Supply Chain related projects.
The instructor, course material, and the quizzes all are excellent. I would highly recommend this to people who are just starting on a supply chain profession or studies. It touches all the necessary things related to a supply chain. From the manufacturing department to warehousing and transportation department's part in the supply chain is clearly explained by Mr. Brown. Thank You, Professor! And Thank You, Coursera!
The course was very detailed and well structured, deserves many thanks to all who took part to prepare materials and readings. Maybe one thing i would like to improve in it, is alignment of videos and reading materials, because not always they were following each other. But overall, it was very interesting, entertaining and easy to understand. I would like to learn more courses by Georgia Tech.
The course helped me greatly in documenting, all the practice that I have in Supply Chain, for all the processes there are bases and here are the bases that erefuerzan the Know How. I am happy to have taken the same, as it helped me identify some concepts that I had left along the way and on the other hand learn from new things that I do not know. Thank you
Fantastic course, working in analytics domain my upcoming project was mostly to do with Supply Chain efficiency measurement and improvement. I needed a quick understanding of Supply Chain system and this course was more than enough. To the point well structured and laid out course. The instructor explains well and this is absolute fun and loads of learning.
It is a very good course which had given me deep insights on different topics of supply chain & logistics including SCM basics with Purchasing, Procurement, Manufacturing, Strategic Planning in SCM, Warehousing & Transportation (Basically based on U.S limitations). I want to thanks Georgia Institute of Technology & Prof. Tim Brown.

This course was awesome I have been in the Warehouse and Distribution field for many years and I as if I was looking at everything with a fresh set of eyes I learned so much these past few weeks thanks I am so looking forward to taking more classes here.
Well explained and well taught course. Even individuals new to these concepts can easily grasp and understand the lessons. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to have some idea or knowledge of Supply Chains in general before going into the field.
I feel this is an excellent course to involve into supply chain in general. It's very organized so you can learn about everything about it. It's crucial if you have an Industrial engineer carrer and you want to make emphasis in supply chain.
This course has proven to be more in-depth and informative than I had initially anticipated.It delves into several aspects of supply chain operations and is a well rounded course for anyone seeking to move into this field.
After completing the course I know about the supply chain network  where what is happening inside from product order to delivery to customer. It will be very for my upcoming career.Thank you Georgia Tech and coursera Org.
