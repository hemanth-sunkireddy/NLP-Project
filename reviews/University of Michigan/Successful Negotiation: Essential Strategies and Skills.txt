The course was not what I expected. In my opinion there is no academic foundation but most likely evolved science. There have been times that was eager to finish the video. The bibliography was poor and the lecture slides very bad. Also, the whole subject of the course is the professor's book, word for word, so that means in case you buy the book, you have the hole course, but not the certificate.The least I can say, is that this act is unprofessional, anti-ideological, and it does not take the course in another level with more knowledge.
This course disappointed me. I expected to receive knowledge about negotiation. But it's more advertisement for the book. I did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasn't in the course. I assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz. That's not why i registered on coursera.
Poor content, only a book accompanies the videos and we should not be forced to buy anything!
Not very well organized course to teach the essential principles of negotiation.  The course material moves incongruently between legal and business negotiation tactics, which would make it difficult for any untrained future negotiator to understand the art of negotiation and ADR for business and law.
Video content is difficult to follow. Instructor asks a lot of questions without providing answers to the audience. Very heavy on stories and examples, but leaves out basic need-to-know content like definitions to vocabulary words that the instructor continuously refers to. I often found myself pausing the video lecture to Google a topic because the instructor provides no information about it, assumes the viewer is already well-versed in the subject, and jumps right over an explanation then launches into a 15-minute example. The course material per week is very lengthy because the instructor uses too many examples or speaks in monotone; I found myself pausing the video and simply reading the subtitled text beneath the video to actually learn the content.
I think this training s more appropriate for lawyers than normal people, I was hopping to learn more about negotiation techniques and it was a times very technical.
Slow slow slow slow slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Complete course zero bole bad main money mag rha very bad credit hum bhaut study karne bad degree mila 97% marks plz my certificate cum
THIS WAS MORE OF A BUSINESS LAW COURSE THAN A  NEGOTIATION COURSE, I HAVE COMPLETED OTHER COURSES ON THIS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER
It is very boring. You should change the teacher. Or, the content of the course.
The Professor is very slow and boring.
Why certificate is not free
it was not useful for me
costly
Profoundly knowledgeable, but very soft spoken Professor - was difficult to maintain interest and energy especially in this remote learning medium. Decided to table this course for a while and revisit when my learning attitude is calmer and more in-line with his communication style.
I will definitely say most of the lectures and videos which are shown in this course, were quite interesting. But what I felt lacking was there was no smooth transition between the legal aspects and the other part of negotiations and left quite a few people (supported by other reviews) confused. Also, the quizzes including the final one were designed almost as if it expected you to buy the coursebook, without which it will become quite difficult to pass, they were quite ambiguous.
I have mixed feelings about this course. I notice that a lot of courses like these in US colleges are incredibly glorified. The professor sounds knowledgeable, I have to admit. The material, however, seems mostly like common sense. Most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time. Just like business courses, people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever. Also, very boring.
should you decide to follow a single course  I would suggest this one: "Introduction to Negotiation: A Strategic Playbook for Becoming a Principled and Persuasive Negotiator (Yale Uni)" also available on coursera.here the speaker is pedantic, and very slow. material is good, but was not adapted to an on-line media. you are just watching a recorded class. not so engaging.Also the continues push to buy the speaker's book, is a real put-off. No other suggested book.
I think this course should have two versions. A shortened version that teaches basics in every day negotiations (first half of the course) and then the full in-depth course. It seems Mr Seidel is very succesfull in his profession, but I'm not interested why Russian students did laugh as he said "zopa" in one of his classes. The course should be more precise in delivering the contents.
I thought the instructor was very well organized, and knowledgeable. However, the information I received, at times, appeared more descriptive than informative. What I mean, is that I feel that we were told a lot about how things are, and very little about what to do. Overall, great instructor, I had expected more "strategy" and "guidance."
Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.
Repetitive and stating the obvious from all sorts of angles. But this may be usual for business classes.
The course is good but there is too much talk for nothing , you need to be brief and right to the point
El curso ofrece un certificado simple, sin distinción por lograr un puntaje alto o máximo.
Very Theoretical. Expected lot of activity to get the complete knowledge.
Good context, however, long videos, didn’t catch my attention.
Wasn"t great. I didnt find the tests great
Not for me.
It is quit common and not much interesting course compare to the Yale's one. There is much less practical and usefull information , while there is all theoretical base   info (BATNA, ZOPA and so on). Unfortunately approach of lecture are too boring and a lot of part of it are devoted to the laws  (mediation, arbitration). If you are not beginner lawyer it wont interesting you a lot.  There is only 1 practice between student (at Yale's course there is two and moreover there you could get feedback of others students not involved in negotioations and there is explonation of typical behaive in particular negotiations).Will I advice this couse? Well might be. In some theoretical thing is quit nice, but I wish more practice knowledge (how to deal with people, how to contra-react to some typical manipulation and so on. BATNA and ZOPA and so on are useful, but let be honest we deal with people and it means that sometime charisma, challengable behavior can strongly influence at you during negotiations - What we should expect and more over how we should meet it or reduce? this it out of this course.I might be too emotional and its my imho, but too boring approach for teaching. I definitely rape myself to follow this course while another one (Yale) was much more nice.
So much to like about this course and I really enjoyed the final actual exercise of a negotiation.  Chief complaints:  1) the final is nothing like the quizzes interspersed throughout the lecture, and 2) a horrendous number of typos in the transcripts of the videos, including major ones (e.g., Pearl Evidence Rule instead of Parole Evidence Rule and many more like that).  For a class that has been taken by supposedly "hundreds of thousands" of students, many of which paid for a certificate, you would think the have plenty of resources to provide a clean copy of the text -- in consideration of our non-English students if nothing else.  And yes, I did submit that comment to the course mentors, who suggested I volunteer my time (after paying for a certificate) to go clean up their transcript.  Right.
Nice course with many tips, but very enterprise and US oriented. To be expected, but still I would have liked some more day-to-day aspects coming up. It is possible to adapt most tips but I think that could enrich the course.The teaching voice should be more active. Felt like a falling asleep university course. A negotiator should be a more fluid speaker (in my humble opinion, not an expert in any ways).
It has good content (simple and common sense from my perspective, but usefull). The problem is that it actually looks more as a Decision making course than a Negotiation skills course. If not, it just looks as publicity for Mr Siedel's book, as the videos are Mr Siedel reading word by word what is written in the book. It is not compulsary to buy the book (around 13$ in Amazon), as the videos cover the whole book, but if it weren't for the certificate and the practical case I would just buy the book and not pay for this course.However, don't get me wrong, as I said before the content is good, and I am glad to have the book as it has a lot of usefull summaries, keypoints and lists. It is just not the type of course that I expected. That's why I recommend to look at the content (not just reading the titles of the videos because some of them are misleading) before paying the course.
The Learning Pace and Content was really Good.  It was interactive in a way questions were merged within modules and needed attention to be solved. Final Assessment was also in line with content so it made it wholesome. Howsoever, it might have been made inclusive with more real life examples and include cross-functional negotiations other than sale and purchase.
Great course content. However, i would personaly regret that most of the course is focused on the resolution/legal aspects of a negotiation process, rather than the strategies and skills as per suggested by the course title. I would however definitely recommend this course, which has been of great interest to me !
this course started very excellent and exciting but I think we'd better be informed more about negotiation it self rather than learning ADR process in detail.but totally it was beneficial for someone who wants to start to learn how to negotiate and how should think at the start point of negotiation.
This course started really well and went through the principles of negotiation that were very useful. But it drifted towards focusing more on dispute-resolution and very heavy on the lawyer jargon which was not what I was looking for. The presenter is great though. Very clear and interesting.
The final negotiation homework was very interesting, and useful in internalizing the concepts. I didn't like the fact that the course spent a lot of time covering legal topics. Perhaps due to the instructor's legal background. I wish there were practical recommendations on salary negotiation.
It's better to just read the transcripts than watch the painfully boring videos. If you don't have an interest in law then you won't find this class very interesting.  I thought the information was good but could have been better presented.
gave some negotiation skills, but it is more a class to binge in a day than to take over a month or two.the main skill is a way of thinking about option values and how to choose based on risk trees.
A lot of theory, and mostly focused on business and contracts negotiations, probably it would have been more useful for general / every day negotiations. Still informative and nicely explained
Enjoyed the professor, but there was lots of fluff and ultimately spent far too much time focusing on legalities and minor details and less on actually imparting negotiating skills.
I struggled a lot with the presenter of this course. The presentation was quite fluffy yet the book is direct and straight to the point on the theory of negotiations.
A good course but rather dry. The whole course was the professor sitting at his desk talking to the camera.The information was good but could be delivered better.
The course is interesting, but in the other hand is too basic, If you already have some knowledge about negotiationg it wont give you a lot of knowledge.
Overall learned new skills that I can apply in the future, but didn't find the course particularly interesting enough to keep me engaged.
Good basic overview.  Not groundbreaking content or presentation compared to courses featuring Steve Blank or leaders from Google.
Not a bad course. But I would have liked to have more on core negotiation skill rather than contract law and dispute resolution.
Good material and final. Quizzes at the end of each week would be helpful. Also, the videos could have been quite a bit shorter.
As traduções para o português estão duplicadas o que dificultou o processo de estudo e entendimento de algumas partes do curso.
Learned a lot on improving my negotiations skills and relate it with frameworks. Good beginners course .
It was really good experience to learn here so much about new skills.
have explained excellent negotiating skillswith real life examples
More quizzes within the weeks that count for the final grade
Good course, good material, good instructor, poor execution.
Great But Could use more info-graphics in the videos
Good for starter and had lot of information
I really liked the approach on this course
It is targeted to business negotiations.
教授很仔细，循序善诱；看得出课程设计很用心；但是，真正的谈判是 灵活多变 的！
6 options not required in final exam.
Final exam too long and difficelet 45
some quality nuggets in here
Too much law for non lawyers
Very helpful.for knowledge

Very interesting and useful.Mr Siedel is bright and explains well.The whole course is worth spending time on it, even if you have the experience in negotiations already.It helps to rationalise and don't forget any aspect of the negotiation process up to the conclusion.Some concepts could be difficult to really understand if you don't get already an exposure to the American business culture.
I liked this course overall, and thought it had some thought-provoking and actually useful bits of information. I am a researcher in her 20s at the University of Michigan hospital, to provide a bit of my perspective. I originally took this course to (hopefully) get some ideas for how to negotiate salaries, perks, and benefits with potential employers and how to better represent myself in private purchases for things such as used vehicles. In my experience, this course was about 70% theory/large-scale negotiation and 30% real life tips and suggestions, so it did not exactly fulfill my original hopes for the course, but did provide me with a lot to think about when it comes to business-to-business or business-to-client negotiations that may come in handy in the future (and if not, then at least it's some new insight). Pros: very accessible to many cultures and countries, some tips for psychological traps that are commonly present in negotiation situations, real life examples of companies following different theories outlined in the course, the instructor was fairly engaging and seemed genuine in his interest and very experienced, "The House on Elm Street" example that is given in this course and intended to be carried out with another person in real life was quite useful and fun Cons: not super useful for my purposes (outlined above), I wish there were more examples/practice prompts similar to "The House on Elm Street" so that we could practice a variety of scenarios and hone some skills over several attempts at realistic negotiation scenarios
The professor is well-knowledged  and able to provide very high quality course. I do lean a lot from his class.Though English is my second language, prof. George's explanation is very clear, easy to understand and on the point. The videos help a lot when i was learning. It's more efficient and memorable than reading the book (i also purchase the book and write notes during my learning). Generally, I's satisfied by the knowledge I learned so far. Due to device limitation, i, prof, and other students may not able have interaction which may influence our learning quality (Negotiation required a lot of practice and experiences). But I still can see our prof's effort on making this class memorable to us.At the end, Thank you Prof. George for providing meaningful education.
This course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. My two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week. This is very strange. The test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before.
This is a very well designed course for negotiations and contract making. The thing I found which would have been added benefit is more practical elaboration in Week 3 of actual negotiation techniques. More of these tools could have been covered and practical guides and case studies like negotiating for increases compensation, negotiating with a supplier etc.Some of these tools which I found from the book "Never Split the difference" areDisarming your opponent by saying the worst thing about yourself first, particularly helpful in dispute resolution negotiations.Asking "How am I supposed to do that?"Mirroring techniqueWriting the specific number instead of round off number.Giving a range etc.
Good course, you really learn skills which are valuable in real (business) life. The exercise of week 6 is excellent.However, it was a bit slow paced and a bit too easy. I think I could have learned the same material in much less time if the videos had been more to the point (maybe some exmaples less, or explain an example with 2 sentences instead of 5).If you want to go faster, just read the book and only do the exercise of week 6 and the end exam. The book is almost a literal transcription of what he says in the videos. Indentical examples and anecdotes.Summary: content was great but could have been more fast paced.
Some strategies I learnt, I would have never thought of. An interesting course and quite enjoyable. A great course for any business person who needs the essential ingredients for negotiating. Thank you to the lecturer and much appreciated.Perhaps a little additional material to give it some depth? I just felt a little more was needed to validate the material to put what we learn into practice. But apart from that, a worthwhile course for anyone that needs to negotiate in their business. I am sure I will refer back to this from time to time, as some pointers will help keep you in focus with your strategies.
I just found the final exam a bit confusiong when the answers options were displaying >  "two of the above". What does it mean? 1: the last two answers which are located right above ? or 2: any other answer that is above?. Still, I found the course not clear enough on the differences and similarities between mediation, arbitrarion, litigation. I know it is a lot to cover, but the course is ambigous about these themes. Anyhow, it was very interesting, George is awesome, I've learned from it and I do recommend it to my friends for sure! Thanks for the opportunity!
Primeiramente eu agradeço a oportunidade de ter estudado esse curso de forma gratuita na plataforma Coursera. Esse curso é recomendado a pessoas que não tem noção de como é feita negociações de preço. Ele explora de forma geral algumas leis sobre negociação nos EUA.Os motivos por não considerar a nota máxima são: Verborragia e que o curso não é adaptado a todas as legislações, mas expõe de forma geral alguns conceitos universais como fraude, mesmo que não seja diretamente aplicável a legislação de todas as nações.
My personal opinion is that every lawyer needs to master the art of negotiation and this is one of the best if not the best platform to initiate that process. I would say specifically that I have learnt a lot and I believe this would give me an edge over lawyers that have no idea about this in my country (NIGERIA).Thank you very much coursera for giving people like me an opportunity to know and understand more. You are truly creating a world without educational boundaries.
Would like more exercises to test knowledge throughout the course, not just one large exam at the end.  Would prefer less choices on final exam questions to better demonstrate one's knowledge of material, not test-taking skills.Professor Siedel is a wonderful professor with many years of both theoretical and practical knowledge.  His real-world examples allow students to apply course materials beyond academia to the business world and life in general.
This course was really useful and Prof. Siedel is such a great person. It is a pleasure listen to his lectures that were more like stories. I however would have liked to have little quizzes in between the weeks to review the content. It adds up quite a lot and even taking notes, at the end some info gets missing. I definitely recommend this course though. I am sure I will do much better in my next negotiation.
The course is well designed to give extra mileage on the Negotiation skills. The presentation of the course and examples are very helpful for learning the concepts well.In my opinion some topics needs more focus and illustration namely " Decision Tree", Different options of Authority like Express,Apparent and Implied.I througly enjoyed the topics and it will defntly benefit me in my Negotation skills.
The course is great, but the title was misleading for me. I would call it "Contract Negotiation", because there is a lot of information on the laws and the specifications of contract signing that I think are too specific to be present in a general negotiation course. Other than that, the teacher is great and the tests/exams also allow for a continuous notion of our progression.
The way professor Mr. G. Siedel conducted the course is very practical and useful. Invites always to "think about answers" to complex questions and his new  approaching  techniques to negotiate with success are truly useful to analyze your behave negotiating, and therefore , improve in the negotiation techniques and knowledge  of tools and different approaches to a negotiation.
В цілому курс сподобався, але була одна досить велика проблема. На жаль, я не володію англійською мовою, тому доводилось перекладати Google. Переклад далекий від досконалості, і були випадки, що я не міг зрозуміти про що взагалі йде мова і яку відповідь обрати. Це трохи вплинуло на кінцевий результат.  Побажання: зробіть переклад на екзаменаційні запитання на інші мови.
For me, this course was very thought-provoking. The professor gave many examples to make sure students understood the study materials. It was very interesting and challenging course. Even for someone who doesnt have skills in negotiation, this course definetely helped me to understand how to negotiate with structure and how to use it.  Every penny was worth it!
It is a quite well structured course. Is missing a little bit "flash" to become more incentive, attractive. Negotiation is part of "sell and buy" something and many times is not only a scheme of calculus, could be also sentimental decision and in this case is difficult to determine the right value (value creation is like a bubble soap, nice but easy to break).
This is a very dense course, offering a quite detailed information and technique on negotiation. While the focus is very much on business deal negotiations, one can pick up transferable skills to apply in other areas. While the knowledge gained through this course is not directly applicable in my area of work, it is a useful course to have taken.
Amazing tutor Professor Siegel. Your simplified manner of delivery of the concepts relating to the real time incidents is what draws more from this programme. The book on NEGOTIATION STRATEGY authored by you will be as a memory of pursuing this programme and a treasure to me.Thank you University of Michigan for embracing this course.
This course covers all the bases of general negotiation.  The professor is well traveled and credentialed in his field and gives very frank, matter-of-fact presentations of the material.  The only thing I would change about the course is that I would have periodic check-up quizzes to help the learner gauge his/her understanding.
this is an exceptional and well-designed course study and I hope It will help in the future to crack the better deal in the corporate world. Even though somehow I felt It could be better explained in some topics because I felt that the professor has presumed that we know some of the terms and topics. Thank you Prof. Seigle.
Great course, give you a lot of opportunities to learn and improve your Knowledge on the subject, but it lacks on help (even when it is well known that the final text is really difficult), as well as it can be a little bit repetitive or slow some times. Regardeless of those things, i really enjoyed my time learning.
It was an interesting course. I did not know much about concepts, techniques, and tools for negotiations. There are also examples given for every new concept. However, there are some unclear content and some law-related concepts that make a person who is not pursuing law confused. But I do recommend it in general :)
Very good and useful teachings!. Thank you and congratulations.  The teaching method could be perhaps improved , making it more attractive. It's too much based on a bit monotonous videos, with scarce interaction or variation. And I would say that  the final exam is a a bit tricky. Anyway  I think is a really good c
This course is great to understand the insights and essential skills to undergo a negotiation. Professor. Siedel has great acknowledge and expertise and outlines this in a great manner. The only thing that could be improved is the relevance of the information given that the initial course was published in 2014.
Exceptional practical knowledge well explained examples, one confusing part was in the final exam multiple choice of the answer option titled "two of the above" as the student should be able to select 2 each of the 2 answers or this option is redundant in my opinion other wise overall really enjoyed the course.
O curso oferece uma visão geral e com detalhes sobre as ferramentas e fundamentos da negociação. O conhecimento do curso interessante para se ter como uma habilidade útil em diversas situações da vida.O curso não irá te ensinar como ser um negociador, ele te dará informações de técnicas e como usá-las!
This course is focussing on negotiation in business.But the presented concepts and strategies can be used in private negotiations of all kinds.I found the legal aspects of negotiation of contracts rather boring, but then you can watch the videos in double speed.All in all a very useful course for me.
It was a great learning experience with professor over last few week, it kept me engaged & most important inspired me for future, this course Structure , the reading, personal learning and assignment and action learning assignment is quite unique. This course give really good fundamental awareness
for a begineer with tech background I found this course eyeopening and very entertaining I must say the instructor is a wonderful teacher even though many terms are bookish for people belonging to non-business functions , i am very pleased to get to this course and pass sit it . Bravo Sir Seidel
I would prefer that the rationale behind a correct or incorrect answer for the quizzes and final exam are added so I am fully sure I grasped the concept especially for wrong answers. Other than that, the course is absolutely amazing and helps tremendously both in business and in personal life.
Una crítica y sugerencia para mas adelante es que tanto las lecturas, como los exámenes puedan traducirse. Muchas veces la traducción del explorador arroja errores y no tuve éxito para traducirlas. Pude realizarlo utilizando un traductor externo (copiando y pegando), pero resulta engorroso.
The course is very informative and very helpful and practical to individuals like me who wants to reorient themselves with the basics of negotiation. I can apply how to negotiate effectively both with my personal undertakings and with my professional undertakings in my future assignments.
I really enjoyed Professor Siedel's simple style, using a bit of humour but at the same time ensuring the point is clearly conveyed. In my area of work negotiation is a key tool and this course has taught me some basic, yet important, aspects one needs to keep in mind. Thank you Professor
Dr. Siedel is extremely informative when it comes to breaking down the roles people play in any negotiation and the intangible aspects of the transaction overall. I recommend this course to anyone in a sales position or in corporate positions that conduct a lot of B2B transactions.
The course was amazing, very interesting and gave me some valuable skills, which I will able to use during a negotiation process in my business and private life. From my point of view the final exam is too detailed taking into consideration that the course is lasting min. 7 weeks.
This is a very interesting course. It is the first course I followed on Coursera and it worth my time and money. Various skills and strategies are being taught which I took for granted before. This course is helpful both for the day-to-day negotiation and for business ones.
Compared to other online courses that I've taken up, this course was considerably difficult compared to them. I believe it's because it's totally out of my interests and abilities. However, I'm not regretting taking this course in fact, I'm so glad that I applied for it.
Learned a lot in this course, even though I was not new to the subject. Great review of psychological traps and biases to avoid, and a nice overview of third party and alternative resolution options. THANKS Professor Seidel for making all of this knowledge available!
The content in this course was in detail and it helped me to understand all the concepts properly, the professor also explained the concepts in such a way that negotiating in a deal is easy. Thank you so much, looking forward to enroll in such helpful courses.
World class teacher. Fine contents with a very useful legal approach that is often missed in introductory negotiation courses. Compared to other Coursera MOOCs I missed support materials or further readings. Additional assignments and cases could be included.
I find this course especially helpful in my everyday life. Interesting thing is that I was selling my apartment while I was litsening to this course and this may be my biggest motivation to follow up this course as I want to negotiate an ideal selling price.
I thank Professor George Siedal and Coursera for the course. It was useful and enjoyable experience while doing this course. I joined this course to learn regarding negotiations but I also ended up learning about contracts,mediation and arbitration.
Overall a recommended course. It brings improved perspective specially over fixed pie myth and equips with better understanding of negotiatioImprovement can be done in the areas of decision trees and more data can be added to psychological tools.
Course is great, it might be helpful in negotiations at every aspect of life. It also shed the light onto aspects of different laws and contract rules. Still, the final grade is a bit complex taking into account the previous ones are light.
Very good course! Mainly the Negotiation Test, where we can put into practice many theories shown by Mr. Siegel. I didn't give 5 stars because (in my opinion) the course could be a little less focused on laws and legal procedures, and mor
This course is challenging, but if you stick with the deadlines and take the exam within the timeline you will learn the content deeply. There is a lot of usable information in this course whether it is for personal or professional use.
Досить цікавий курс що дозволяє поглянути на переговори більш широко, не тільки у бізнесі, а й у повсякденному житті. Також хочу додати що дізнався цікаві способи вирішення проблемних ситуацій та нюанси у підготовці до переговорів.
This was a very good course covering negotiation theory from a very interdisciplinary perspective. It covered behavioral sciences, game theory, and interpersonal communications aspects with potential implications to negotiation.
Great Introductory Course and well taught. Only feedback is while Mr. Siedel is speaking that sometimes they slides for reference can be kept on screen while he is speaking so we can understand the visuals whilst he explains.
Great course! Very useful negotiation techniques. It's not easy to pass the final exam which you can see the level of the curse. I've enjoyed practicing with the exercises, especially with "The house of Elm Street" exercise.
Excellent course for anyone interested in improving their negotiation skills. Ever since the first lesson I have started looking at the business world from a new perspective. The book is a great read and not too exhaustive.
bom dia, Gostaria de parabenizar pelo curso. Muito bom de um conteúdo invejável. Só uma crítica resta, na emissão do certificado, deveria ser mais prático e menos burocrático. A burocracia e a demora, sempre coloca a dúvida
Very good and interesting! Thank you very much for giving us possibility to learn from you practical experience. However, some of the points are very important may be just for the US juridical system and not elsewhere.
Content is good with real life examples and cases which helps you to imagine the situation and analyse on your own. The continuous activities in course keeps you attentive and make the course interesting and lively.
Certiicate for free will be nice, because in czech students can not affort buy it thisGenerally about the course who know you get some information but some times the information was useless i dont need it in my live
Great course! Preparing for a negotiation and negotiation tools units are really good, last unit is a bit boring. The final negotiation is really entertaining and helps a lot to sink in the contents of the course.
curso muy interesante y actual, que te brinda las bases para reforzar y aprender nuevos metodos de negociacion. me parece un curso practico y real, aplicable en nuestras actvidades diarias. lo recomiendo sin duda.
This is a great course where I learn all the essential skills and tools which are needed for successful negotiation. The lectures were entertaining and interactive as well. I enjoyed taking this course very much!
This course helps me much in real life. It improves my negotiation skill in many situations of life.But I think it has a little bit much US's law, it is not really helpful for everybody, but some specific region.
Great course, simple overview of negotiations and theory. Offered interesting case examples based on real events; gentle and steady pace. Didn't buy the book, but wonder if that would have been much different.
Muy buen curso, el Prof. George Siedel es MUY buen profesor y siempre es muy carismático. Creo que el problema es que todas las evaluaciones eran en Inglés pero aún así vale la pena tener estas herramientas.
Very usefull for my line of work and I do believe that, regardless of your line of work  it's very helpull to understand this tools, skills and strategies because we are always negotiating something in life.
Excellent course, without no doubt it is a keep tracking methodology for negotiate in your daily basis, will recommend to any person who needs to evolve and gain more insights into the real world businesses.
4/5: Professor is a good teacher and very well versed in the material, which is very relevant. Only issue I had, which justifies a solid 5/5 becoming a 4/5 in my opinion, was that it was a little too slow.
ADR, BATNA, ZOPA , Screens...These concepts are so brilliantly covered in a very logical manner. This has ignited my interest to take another shot at a higher finance related course with legal sidelines..
This was a great course with an instructor that was very articulate.  I would recommend this course to anyone no matter the reason, business or personal.  It was easy to follow and the content flowed.
The approach is good, the tools show are excellent but all is related with attorney. It's more related with law causes but brought new learning for me. I got new knowledge and its the most important!
I never thought that I  would do a course of this type but as I started the course I liked it so much and was so interested in finishing it as soon as possible. Thanks to my professor George Siedel.
The course content was informative and engaging. I have a lot of negotiations with my current role and I found this very insightful and practical. Professor Seidel is very clear in his explanation.
This is an amazing course from University of Michigan . I learned a lot from this course. This course is so informative and the way George Siedel sir taught us, it make course so easy to understand
Fue una enseñanza única, cerca de la excelencia, lo valore mucho. Respecto a la traducción, me gustaría que adaptaran los exámenes a cada idioma, para que se comprenda al resolver los ejercicios.
A great course on negotiation tactics discussed by Sir George Siedel. The facts and keys pointed and explained so deeply here that could accumulate our learnings in our real-life applications.
Good course.  the exam had some topics wheich were not clear in the lectures.  Also, it would be helpful is the slides of the lectures were available as opposed to downloading every lecture.
Really good course, but the One Final Exam is a bit long (45 questions).  IF that one final exam could have split into 10 questions for each week's exam, it would have been much better.
Nice course, very engaging, with a good level of depth and the right duration.The legal part is basically oriented on American law, but it gaves also some hints of the European model.
le professeur montre vraiment sa qualité en négotiation, il essaie de bien forger notre caractère pour savoir discuter. je crois être prêt pour faire de bonnes affaires maintenant.
It was an enriching and knowledgrebile experience for me. I learned the basic skills of Negotiation and the way of Presentation was really wonderful. Thank You for this opportunity
Being from a technical background this course was very enlightening, interesting and something different. Learnt a lot about how these skill are very useful in our day to day life.
Good course, enjoyed the insight and examples. Would of been brilliant if there was a summary document for each week for main points and definitions. Useful to print out and keep.
Interesting, focused on relevant matters, practical. Enriched  with many examples and one involving practical exercise. I would have appreciated questions after each lesson block.
Loved this course! This course provides applicable theories and techniques for the real world. George's calm and witty nature helps to keep you engaged and motivated. Thank you.
Course is good and covering lot of aspects to be considered during negotiations.Some concepts are not applicable in India like never heard about  the concept of  arbitration.
Excelente curso! Com uma forma bem fácil de entendimento, expôs os principais temas sobre negociação, não só no aspecto local, mas com dicas para negociações internacionais.
Very good contents and methodology of the course.Learn to look at the things through the different angles.The knowledge is useful for professional and personal life also.
Excellent course. Professor Seidel provides very good examples that makes it easier to understand theory. I would only recommend to provide more free based bibliography.
The course has been well programmed to ensure a holistic learning of the students. People carrying no similar background will also be able to cope pace with the topics.
I have gotten so much knowledge about legal procedure of negotiation. My interpretation about all courses is really hard for students who are not in a Business School.
Achei o curso muito bom e com exemplos bastante interessantes. As técnicas ensinadas podem ser aplicadas para grandes negócios, mas também para situações do dia a dia.
I enjoyed the professor’s style of teaching. He was pleasant and sometimes funny! I learned that everyday is full of negotiations and it is up to me to be successful!
Excelente curso! Minha única observação é a tradução para o português. As legendas falhavam, e as provas não são traduzidas. Se fosse em português, seria mais fácil.
Good course though it can be difficult to follow because of the lack of theoretical context. This course seems to assume that everyone know US laws and regulations.
Esta un poco pesado, pienso que debería ser mas ilustrativo y usar ejemplos menos complejos, para la comprensión total del curso. Pero en general es un buen curso
Well done, Very clear about the goals of the course,Prof. Seidel speacks in very easy english, easy to understand also for non english native language.Loved it!
It was a great course to know the general skills for negotiation, but it is more focused on the laws and rights than on the negoctiation for procurement side.
the lectures were a bit longer than i  prefere . i encourage you to read the book to go faster with the courses . but i learned a loot than i expect . thanks
Great course not only for professional usage. Many concepts are extremely helpful for personal situations. This is a material that everyone should access.
Very useful course!!! It gives you important tools to succeed on a business environment as negotiation is involved in almost every situation of our lives.
Always try to understand other person's perspective! This is one of the key thing in negotiation. Good course with good practical negotiation in the end.
I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn into formal and personal negotiations for sure. Very articulate and excellent content.
Some of the speeches are really very long and need patience to finish. I'm happy that he exam is much easier and takes not very long time to get passed.
Exceptional teaching. The main detraction for me was that some practice videos had poor audio quality; particularly the video on mediation proceedings.
very good introduction, over focus on legal terms to my opinion, but most of the course deal with how  to nego' and how to make successful nego'.
Great course,  but in my opinion a bit too much focus on ADR-procedures. Would  personally have liked more emphasis on negotiation-processes.
He is certainly a very good teacher, but he is boring.He uses this same monotonous tone,but seeing the content it does help us understand.
Me gusto mucho el contenido del curso, muy enriquecedor, solo mejoraria la manera en la que se imparte ya que puede ser un poco aburrido!
Very very good! Professor Siedel, thank you very much.I missed more math, but I think It would be a different course then.Recommended.
well structured. should be more focused on practical applications. the final exam could be more hands on on cases than on definitions.
Amazing lecture and presentation. Kindly provide PDF file format of all course information for reading purposes and future reference.
very good case study material , however I would request to make it more sale specific as I find it very heavy on legal and contracts
I thnk it's a great online course. The only thing missing is a little more interaction with the professor with peers. Recommended.
I enjoyed the modules and learnt newer concepts which are not only applicable in business but also in everyday life. Thank you!
Well structured negotiation strategies that would be applied with more discipline and evaluation of the the end result in mind.
This course has good examples and tha book is very easy to read. I believe could have more technical arguments on discussions.
Very good course on negotiation.  It would be nice to have a summary of the slides to download afterward for future reference.
This  was a great course, the only thing that could make it better is if there was a PDF print out available to study from.
excellent course with good instructor .This course should be taken by all who is interested in opening their own company
Excellent lesson plan ,well design ,easy for understanding.,good questios for exam Not a easy exam to pass this subject.
muy interesante. A veces profundiza mucho en aspectos legales y se hace un poco tedioso. Pero en general esta muy bueno.
O curso surpreendeu minhas expectativas, trazendo conhecimentos ricos e específicos para qualquer negociador. Parabéns!
Amazing course and the instructor was very good at explaining.Will love taking online course on University of Michigan
Very interesting and enriching course. It gave me more than what I expected. Definitely a must for young negotiators
good videos and explanations, it provides tools for negotiate andexplain very well all the negotiation environment.
The course was full of great lessons and stories to keep it interesting. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. Thank you!
Good material and a great presentation by the professor. Examples are good quality and some of them from real life
the course allowed me to look at the negotiation process in a new way, look at the negotiations much more widely
A very good insight to another way of negotiating. I am only half way through but already thinking differently.
Very useful framework to use when negotiating. Totally helpful the practical activity to do an overall review.
Shorth lectures with focus on the main objectives, comprehensive definitions, straight to the point examples.
Awesome 👍, but unable to generate certificate after completion of the course whereas it was mentioned Free.
Good content, but very US based (as to be expected from a US university i suppose). More law than i expected
Great course, with a very pragmatic approach. Recommended to anyone who has to negotiate on a regular basis.
From every lesson, I learn things that not only applicable in negotiation but also in daily life. Thank you.
must take course to understand negotiation skills techniques and step by step introduction to negotiation.
Overall a good course content. However, more shorter examples would have helped retain the content better.
The course has a lot of information referring on negotiation..it was a good course supported on his book.
This course is just amazing, but i guess that  it should have a free-written-material to make it better.
Hi , I’m so happy to finish this course , really I felt   it is so difficult , but I did it thanks God !
Excelente curso e excelente didática. Tenho certeza que o conteúdo e o aprendizado me serão muito uteis.
Very well taught in such a manner that is so easy for understand even for people with no-law background.
Nourish yourself with the knowledge taught by Prof. George Siedel!! Recommended course for everyone....
Contract & Laws should be avoided in this course because most of the law/Contract deals with US based..
More examples may be used to explain the concept of ZOPA, Reservation Price, BATNA and decision trees.
More activities and comparison ANswers, i would like to know the correct answers for my Wrong Answers.
I absolutely loved the course. Only suggestion is to make the videos and duration for a shorter time.
It was a good & insightful course! Nice to learn about the methods & skills required for negotiation.
It's a good course!just a observation that isn't 100% translated. Tasks and evaluation is in english.
This is very useful course to understand many things about negotiation, even in your day to day life
There should be "fast tests" after each class. So that I could check my understanding of the topic.
Me agrado, solo que el libro llega a ser un poco confuso y las preguntas del examen final también.
Lessons learnt in this course benefit your business career and can be used in your personal life
Great but I strongly recommend you watch the videos on 1.5X speed as the prof talks a bit slowly
It was a nice experience going through all the videos an lectures, i really enjoyed the course.
Good content. A lot of content actually. Well explained by a likeable professor. Not difficult.
Nice one. Had new information in it, could have been a bit more interactive, but I enjoyed it!
Good course but more focus on the legal perspective rather than the technique of negotiations
I love this  course thanks to Michigan and Professor or giving me such wonderful opportunity.
El profesor da muchas vueltas y sin intención, da lugar a que los términos resulten confusos.
Its a vary good course and you have kots of opportunity after letting know about negotiation
This course is excellent, the only problem is that french subtitles do not cover all videos.
It was a really good course especially a outsider from the the US has a lot to learn in it!
A bit tough if you are not a law student or business analyst, but worth taking the course.
Great course on building negotiation skills, especially in interviews or salary increases.

RAW
I had a great time attending this course. Its like a long journey which you don't want to come to an end. Dr. George Sidel and his great efforts behind creating this course should sure be applauded.
Probably the best course videos Ive come across. Professor George I believe is an amazing teacher...the way he gets the concept across to students by  simple and constant examples is worth mentioning..
The course helped me fine-tune my negotiation skills. Want to thank Prof. George Siedel for presenting this amazing course in a spectacular manner. The examples conveyed by him in this course provided easier understanding about the concepts & tactics. After completing Week-3 of this course, I tested my negotiation skill and this is the result of the same -"I live as a Paying Guest in a Hostel with a monthly rental of INR 5,500 which includes accommodation & food. Since I go to my office on second shift, i was not able to have lunch & dinner from my hostel which was increasing my expenses. I went to my Hostel Owner and started negotiating regarding the same to reduce my rent. I was able to make him fall into 7 of the 10 traps. I was able to reduce the rent to INR 4,400 and he even permitted me to have lunch & dinner if I want to at the same cost. I promised him to find 3 members to fill the empty rooms available in the hostel.This was a great saving to me and the deal was even too.I was able to find 3 occupants for the vacant room within a week.  Now both of us are very happy with the deal.Very recently, I was even able to sell a used mattresses to him at a fair rate by which I found the amount of goodwill he had in me."Though this might be a very small thing, I was very happy that in my current negotiations I was able to achieve a Win-Win situation that favors both the parties.I finally thank the Coursera Team for providing me the financial aid for pursuing this course and I request the Coursera Team to forward this review to Prof. George Siedel as my thanking token:)
First of all, I want to thank the professor for such great lectures. besides, the course doesn't bound you for department, or professional you have, rather it will help you in every aspect of life.
Great Learning experience, my first but not the last & recommended for those working professionals who have busy schedule and still want to whet their insatiable appetite for contemporary learning
This is one of the best and enlightening MOOC I have taken and I already start reaping the benefit. I encourage everyone who is serious about his/her career to consider this course!Yannick Kounga
It has been an honor and pleasure being able to listen to Professor Siedel's lectures on successful negotiation strategies.  As a law student interested in business/finance/corporate law, his course has been a great comprehensive look at the interconnectedness of business and law.  The humility with which Professor Siedel possesses is humbling and extraordinary of a person of his intellectual caliber and professional accomplishments. Many law/business professors I have known are rather intimidating and unsettling. I have learned an invaluable amount of very unique knowledge and skills that Mr.Siedel teaches to some of the most important financial and legal movers and shakers around the world.  Yet despite his reaches throughout the world, he seems like the most kind and relatable man.  His jokes are impeccably timed, especially during a lesson that may seem a bit dry or difficult and I never found his lectures to be boring.  In fact, throughout my time with the course I always looked forward to the videos and am very sad to see the end of them.Additionally, I had the mindset that in order to be successful in business or law, I'd have to adapt more of a detached, zero-sum approach to my professional life.  Not only has Professor Siedel changed my idea of how business and legal negotiations work, he has shown that there is in fact more to be gained by seeing people as people and not as mere numbers.  Thanks for not just the academic lessons, but life lessons as well. I hope to walk in beauty much as you do Professor Siedel.
Спасибо большое организаторам данного курса! Он мне очень понравился и, как я думаю, будет весьма полезным в моей личной и деловой жизни. Хочу отметить, что русскоязычные слушатели данного курса могут столкнуться с рядом сложностей: в паре видео лекций отсутствуют русские субтитры, все задания, дополнительные материалы и т.п. на английской языке. Так же сложности могут возникнуть, когда речь в лекциях идет о юридических аспектах переговоров, так как они в основном даны для жителей США. Однако данные сложности не станут преградой для людей, которые твердо решили пройти этот курс, так как все тесты можно проходить неограниченное количество раз, пока материал не будет усвоен на должном уровне; а при выполнении задания к неделе 6 (проведение переговоров) не требуется представить видео его выполнения или что-нибудь в этом роде, поэтому, если вам неудобно его выполнять на английском, то вы можете сделать это в "домашних" условиях со своим другом, родственником или другим человеком на родном для вас языке.В связи с вышесказанным, могу смело порекомендовать данный курс самому широкому кругу слушателей.
I absolutely loved the lecturer, George Siedel. He presents in a way where I wanted to listen and I feel like I learned a lot from him just with the way that he spoke. I definitely think that this course is worth doing and I am really happy that did it. The fact that the course was online, didn't feel like it was a barrier to me at all. In fact, I preferred it because I was able to go through the work in my own pace and was thus able to complete the entire course in one week.I really enjoyed this course, and definitely think that the lecturer, George Siedel, played a big part in it. I haven't done many other online courses before, but I'm definitely motivated to try more of Coursera's courses due to the great experience that I had taking this course. Due to the introduction of the University of Michigan made, I am now also strongly considering to apply for the MBA course when I am able.
Great course. Excellent presentation from Prof. Siedel. Very clear and with lots of examples. Loved the interaction during the negotion practice. In my case it was intercultural  that made it more challenging. As for the Final exam also very good. Not an easy test but covers all the course and makes sure we paid attention to the course. If it was easy wouldn't be fun!
Great course! It changes the way I used to see negotiations.
Professor George Siedel, did an extraordinary work about sharing us his knowledge, stories and different cases about the negotiating world.The way the courses are divided and explained are undoubtedly a rewarding experience for anyone looking to extend his/her knowledge path.I really enjoyed, the positive & welcoming behaviour of Professor George Siedel and how he showcase this course on front of the camera: easy words and examples are key on this class and it helped me to absorb the material, very easily!This is indeed; an exceptional course that can only bring more value to our skills and on-going life and professional experience. This course deserve a flawless 5 Star rating!!! I really hope that Professor George Siedel will provide and share new materials in the near future. Thank you Professor George Siedel!
This is my firsy MOOC course and I'm very satisfied about the contents. The professor has been very clear and his examples were very easy and helped us to understand better the theoretical rules.I hope to attend other course in order to improve my skills in my job.I recomend it to everyone who wants improve the negotiation skills.
I learned so much from this online course. I never knew how many different strategies there was to negotiating until now. This course is definitely worth the time and effort to learn these skills.
Great content, real-life example, and flexible schedule. Great for professionals.
A great set of skills to learn and a challenging but rewarding course.
I strongly recommend this course to everyone: Taught by a great instructor, this is a well developed course that encourages you to conduct an actual negotiation with another person (for me that was someone across the globe I found through course forum) and put the learning into practice and receive valuable insights about my personal negotiating style and how I could improve it. I also purchased the text book written by the instructor. However, I am disappointed it doesn't extend much beyond what is already in the videos. To be honest, I felt the book was necessary as there were  a lot of jargon and not-so-clear rules I had to master; especially as a physicist, I found contractual law to be challenging. The final exam was tough, but not unconquerable. Thank you Dr.Siedel!
As an introduction to the  topic it seems to provide essential information. Having little to no previous  experience in negotiation it provides useful insight and different perspective. The pace of the videos seems too slow at times, but the content is relevant to the topic and assessment questions have some difficulty. Surely worth the time and effort.
Great self paced tutorial.  Easy to comprehend topics and principles. Quizzes are good method for understanding concepts.  You are able to retake final exam and quizzes until you master the material.
First of all a big thank you to Coursera for giving opportunity to millions of students to avail excellent distance learning. I have the privilege to complete many courses offered by Coursera. With regard to this particular course "successful negotiation - essential strategies and skills" , the course is very well planned. Although it is planned and executed by the Senior and Renowned Professor of Michigan University, however, the course material, examples, pictorials and presentations are kept very simple for easy learning of students from various disciplines. To me, since I am a Supply Chain  Professional, this course gave me further insight into the core areas of negotiation i.e. planning, tactics, contracts and evaluation. i must thank teacher Mr. George Siedel for including many examples, most of them were real and from teachers personal and professional life which was very helpful to me in understanding.  Thanks and best wishes to my fellow students in their future endeavors.
It was definitely a bad idea to take up this course as my first MooC I took seriously. Professor George J. Siedel’s course was too well-structured, consistent and practical, and have raised my MooC expectations level so high, that now, being absolutely hungry with massive online education, I face certain difficulties in finding a course to keep to the same level. But I go on believing that it's possible. As for the practical application of the knowledge obtained - it’s too early to make conclusions, but having tried some techniques in reality, I find them very helpful. What’s also great: now, getting a bit deeper in some of the issues raised by the course, say, negotiator’s decision making psychology, I find out that what I see in 10 different sources, had already been covered by this only course. And the final practical task was a bit of mind-blowing for me. In a good sense. Thank you very much for the experience!
The combination of real-life examples and the theory behind is a rich and insightful learning experience. The videos with Prof Siedel are not only interesting to watch but also a superb inspiration.One more highlight in the course is the case study to conduct a negotation - could be with another student from around the globe and receive straight feedback.An excellent course I can  highly recommend.
This is a very complete course that will give you tools for your daily personal and professional life. The teacher is excellent and the contents he teaches too. Do not hesitate to take this course!
This is a very interesting course available on Courseera. The concepts are well explained with interaction and real life examples and makes us easy to relate and use in our day to day negotiation.
Great Course, For Negotiation!!
Excellent approach and content.
The course is absolutely great!
I have nothing but gratitude to the University of Michigan for the course “Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills”. Especially to Professor George Siedel  for sharing his valuable knowledge and professional experience in such a humble and kind way and for being able to convey his passion for this discipline.Negotiation is a fundamental skill that we must learn how to use and this course has far exceeded my initial expectations, providing me with a scientific and conceptual framework, tools, techniques and tips that I will be able to use in both my personal and professional career.  It has been a great experience to learn at my own pace and alongside students from all over the world. I found this course very thorough and filled with plenty of case studies that were extremely helpful in understanding the concepts. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who would like to start this interesting journey through negotiation or to fine-tune skills.  The thoughts and ideas will surely stay with me for a long time. Thank you for not just the academic lessons, but life lessons as well.
Dear Professor George Siedel                        Esq., Dear Staff of Business & Law Faculty at
Michigan University                 
Esq., First of all, I would like to thank all the
staff involved in presenting this great course in general and Professor George
Siedel in particular. I would like to admit that the lectures were not only
exciting, but also rich in important terms and information about law and life
in general. This course is different from the other great courses that I had
taken because it made me look differently to life and I learned a lot of
information about courts, companies, attorneys, ADR, agreements, contracts, and
other daily life experiences related to negotiation and enforcing the law.  Finally, I would like to thank you again for
giving me an interesting and pleasant time learning with the distinguished
teaching given by the best instructors world wide.
I was hesitant on taking online courses before, though I was surprised on how connected I felt to the teacher and materials explained through the videos. Mr Sidel is a great teacher and communicator, it was a very enjoyable experience of learling something new which definitely inspired me to take on more courses.I would recommend this course to a friend or a colleague interested in learning something new in this field or revisiting something they have already known but haven't systematized. I hold a high regard for humour and a good system for essential information, that can be very useful in real life and work. Additional praise on the excellent examples to illustrate materials which made it easier to remember.It was a great opportunity to study as face to face is always better but not always possible!THANK YOU!
I have already recommended it strongly to 3 of my close friends. I have already recommended other courses on coursera to 5-6 of my other friends.This a basic must for budding entrepreneurs as we always make stupid mistakes in the initial contracts and shy away from the 'tough talks'.Negotiation is a life skill. It a basic. This course prepares us for the world. Teaches something that is tough for our parents to teach, and impossible to be learnt from school or college, but essential at every step, nonetheless.Now, I am more confident about dealing with people and having the tough conversations.I have been cheated many times in negotiation before. While buying a second hand bike, for instance.This course reduces the chaos in the world around me.Personally, I feel safer.
The course was a combination of fun and challenging. I enjoyed the lectures and the course content. I've learnt so much and I can't wait to apply it in my everyday life. The negotiation exercise was awesome, I got a chance to put the material learnt to good use and see the areas that still need improvement. I'll definitely recommend the course and the book to my friends. Having studied in 2 top universities in South Africa (Wits University and University of Johannesburg), it was refreshing for me to study a module offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera. A big thank you University of Johannesburg for sponsoring the course for me, and a big thank you to Professor George Siedel for the excellent work. - May You Walk In Beauty!
This is an amazing course and also a huge opportunity to evaluate our negotiation skills. The teacher is very clear and the quality of the videos are also good. 

I do realize I have much to practice and a lot to learn.

It goes beyond professional negotiation. I'll apply the concepts worked in this couse through all situations I have to negotiate to get something.

By doing this course I could go back to the begging of my firsts negotiation experiences and remember that better than do well in a negotiation, is to make a big pie and enlarge the benefits to both part involved in it.

I want to thank to all the course team and my moocmates whose have been really nice and helpful.All the best wishes.Renato G Santos.
I loved this course! The material is well thorough and presented in a well organized manner. I learned practical skills that I can use immediately. The course experience also helped to broaden my perspectives on how to approach negotiations, more specifically, the effectiveness of the interest-based approach. While familiar with win/win concepts, still a position-based approach was used. I also like the decision tree tool and calculating the BATNA. This provides a value-based outlook on your options.Finally, I enjoyed the challenge of the course and exam. In order to pass the exam, you really needed to know the material and I believe that this will add value to the programs offered on coursera.org.
Professor Siedel is a great teacher, no doubt. He shares his lifelong experience and teaches a great variety of techniques that most of the students don't know. The course is a great medium to sharpen the negotiation and communication skills, which is very much needed at both the business and diplomacy. The content of this course, quality of the final quiz and obviously the excellence of professor Siedel indicate the reason behind higher ranking of the University of Michigan. After this course, I hope to pursue either masters or doctorate in future at the University of Michigan under feasible scholarship.
I really liked this course. This is a good refresher or a good introduction to deal making or solving disputes in business  life as well as personal life. I really wish it could have a 2nd part or go into more indepth cases, I wish it would use the vides to explain more real life cases, unfortunately the videos cannot be that long. I would highly recommend this course to those who want to refresh some of the lessons that you went over in Business Law class or for those who want to learn some of the basic laws governing deal making and business disputes. The teacher makes the class fun and entertaining.
I think it's a great course that allows an individual to develop his skills and practice in everyday negotiation. It has a unique approach in visualization and towards the results you want to do in a negotiation and asks you a lot of questions: Should you negotiate? What is your goal? Is it legal? Ethical?Prof. Seidel videos are easy to watch and learn and makes you feel as if you were inside one of his classes,he shares his vast knowledge and experience and lets us practice a real life negotiation between students.
I also bought his book, which summarizes and explains other aspects of the course.
Admittedly, I was worried that my attention would be significantly compromised by watching a video of another man staring back at me, and talking for hours.  This was very professionally done, and to draw from the experience of a very capable professor and businessman, with ample relevant examples... made this actually very enjoyable.  I probably owe an apology to my wife for sitting through and listening to my account of the construction arbitration case, and the differences between common and civil law, but we'll strike that one up to enrichment... So she's welcome!  Thank you, Mr. Siedel!
Thanks to Coursera and the University of Michigan for the opportunity to study this course.  In my first higher education, I’m a master of business management, so I have systematically improved my skills in this area.  Currently, I am a TV presenter and producer.  In my work, there are often disputes, conflicts, negotiations and deals.  Now I am ready for them at 100%.  Professor George Siedel is an excellent teacher and I am impressed by his presentation of the material.  Lectures enliven and dilute interesting examples. Thank you and welcome to Ukraine !!
This was the best course I have taken so far. Very informative, the right balance between theory and (lots of) practice, prof. Siedel is a real expert and a great teacher. As a psychologist with no background in law or economy, I struggled at times with course material. This however made me even more motivated to go through lectures once more and I was able to understand everything even better than after the first try. Elm Street exercise and the debrief afterwards were the best! Thank you Coursera for this course! Greetings from Zagreb, Croatia! :)
Loved the course from start to the end. The way of Professor to share the ideas meanwhile the course and way to describe the theory along with suitable examples was amazing. One more thing, I have never seen such faculty who is making you more familiar to his country as well his own town by telling you the stories and facts of the same. Professor Siedel is very fascinated to teach the course and importance of it. I really recommending this course as this is essential for everyone. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan.
Thank you very much for this interesting course, I enjoyed it very much!

I am an Israeli lawyer, and as you may assume the role obliges having strong negotiation skills. I find this course very helpful to understand the fundamentals of any kind of negotiation and it gives practical tools to have it done successfully.

I hope you are doing well and stay safe during this challenging period.

I wish you health and great luck, and please do continue creating such wonderful academic courses.

Best regards,

Michael Lvovsky.
The way course is outlined really noteworthy. Every unit is described very clearly with practical example. To be a successful negotiator, I think this course can be path provider. Because from beginner to skillful negotiator, everything is depicted in this course. Just need patience and understanding to grab the overall course material. Above all, Mr. Siedel makes this course so attractive. His lecture is excellent. Opinion varies from person to person. All I said from my learning and understanding through this course.
Professor Siedel is the best instructor I've ever had in an online class. I really liked the very informative content of the class but mostly the teaching approach that he used from beginning to end. He helps learners understand the complex terms by giving great real life examples and his methodology in general is wonderful!!! I wish I could take another class with him as the professor. I highly recommend this class that will change your perspective in so many ways and make a big impact in your future negotiations.
The best course I've had on Coursera. It's really informative, detailed in a carefully structure, which gives clear overview of how we are about to learn and what's the key takeaway. The instructor is articulate, knowledgeable but not boring at all. Unlike a lot of courses on coursera, this course provides longer weeks to complete this subject, which allows beginners to learn more about negotiation, from basics to tactics, and I look forward to the final game on the last week. I highly recommend this course!
This course has given me the skills to deal better with the issues that I face on daily basis, especially at work. I feel more confident at work when I face a difficult situation, recently I faced a situation where i had to deal with a very important customer who had a complaint  regarding services. I dealt with this situation more professionally than before and saved an important customer.  This all happened because of ADR that I learnt in essential strategies and skills taught by Professor George Siedel .
This course was amazing. I was dubious about how well it would suit me but as I am currently involved in several legal matters I found the information in the course to remarkably pertinent! It cleared up a lot of what I was seeing in my lawyers behavior and to think more from the other side's perspective to understand their tactics. Thank you so much for providing this course. I would recommend it to anyone! We are involved with more legal matters every day than we imagine and this course is an eye opener.
I really enjoyed taking this course and feel that I learned a lot about negotiations that I will be able to apply on a daily basis both professionally and personally. I highly recommend this course to anyone that negotiates regularly especially if done for a living. Even after 20 years of sales experience I was able to take a lot from this course. It is well worth the time and effort. Purchasing the certificate at the end to put on your desk at work is an opportunity you won't want to pass up!
The contents are so relevant to the real world.  I am glad that I have the opportunity to learn these skills and collect the techniques to use for the future.  I always think that that the skillful negotiator will have to lie and being a bad person, but this course change my thought.  I used to scare of negotiation, but now I am up for it. Thank you very much for the fantastic class.  I don't know how you craft this course, but it kept my interest up till the end (which rarely happens).
Really enjoyed this class. It was a good refresher and gave me good ideas how to tweak my negotiations skills after beeing more than 20 years in business.  The class and M. Siedel were a breath of fresh air and made me understood how I approach certain topics in negotiations and be able to be even more effective in them.  One of the most important element is that it showed me how much more I need to LISTEN instead of always have something to say. My wife will certainly agree to this !
I absolutely LOVED this course. I have been in the negotiation business 
for many years and feel that I learned so much from this course and 
cannot wait to apply my new found knowledge. It was not easy by any 
means and did leave me flustered at times but only because it took me 
away from my comfort zones from time to time. This course is a MUST for 
anybody that thinks they know it all about negotiating!  I know I 
thought I did before I took it! Thank you so much Professor Siedel!
One of the best real life course, that has a lot of practical and technical knowledge which most negotiators think they have but really do not know or understand it. It puts our thought process in a scientific way to negotiate with people and to understand how the other person will think and try to trap you. There is a lot of practical examples which helps you to change your way of negotiation. I am glad I took this course and will implement these techniques, in my daily life.
Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills is a very useful program for all person and not just for corporates. its design in a very simple but meaningful manner. Its more apt for legal professionals / sales person who are required to negotiate on different aspect on regular basis. I feel it would have been more useful, I one could attend the face to face class for better experience in the role play, but this was as good as it gets in the virtual world of today.
I had a great time studying Negotiation through the lessons made by Professor George Siedel and made available by Coursera. Honestly, the classes overcame my expectations since Week 1, and I'm grateful for all the learning they provided me. I strongly recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn about all kinds of negotiations and its strategies and legal approach, I'm sure you will find excellent theory complemented by study cases ministrated by Professor Siedel.
This course was wonderful, it was easy to follow and gives a systematic run-down of how to start prepping for a negotiation, This course is already helping me in my personal life - For example-I managed to reduce my gym membership fees by negotiating with the sports club. Thank you for that ! Professionally this has helped me impress my boss and peers by coming up with novel solutions by simply thinking using logic of BATNA and ZOPA to my advantage. Cant thank you enough.
Excellent course!  I recommend this course for everyone interested in negotiation whether you're an amateur (just like me) or a professional. The course content is clear and the lectures are easy to follow. Professor, you explained everything very neatly and clearly. It was a very valuable experience to me, and I found myself learning more than I thought I would. It's definitely worth trying!Thank you professor Siedel for your wonderful work.Best regards,Patrycja E. Stala
Phenomenal insight into many aspects of basic business negotiations and overall contract crafting. As a small business owner I have frequently found contracts with our business being negotiated using some of the very techniques covered in this course. It was refreshing to see them from a well versed perspective and better understand how I might prepare counter negotiations to ensure our companies interests are fairly represented in future contracts and negotiations.
It was a very comprehensive course on negotiation covering key strategies and skills essential for success. There were many case studies and exercises throughout the course to illustrate and deepen understanding of concepts. George shared many personal examples and experiences he came across in his working careers and as a teaching professor. I strongly recommend this course to all those who are int interested to learn more on achieving success in negotiation.
Because of this course, I am more aware of opportunities to negotiate in my every day interactions with others.  I enjoyed Professor Siedel's teaching style.  He gets you to think on a deeper level, especially when he poses questions and presents scenarios.  The course material is framed in a comprehensive manner. In hindsight, this course on negotiation has shown me how much of a poor negotiator I was.  However, I now feel more empowered by what I've learned.
I am absolutely love this course! Despite frequent use of negotiating in my job, I was always dislike to negotiate until I sit for the course and learn the theory. The course also designed so well for a busy professional like me, with less gruesome schedules and deadlines. I totally recommend this course for those who never really completed any course in Coursera successfully, and of course, to those who wants to learn more about the theory of negotiati
First of all, I would like to thank Professor George Siedel. This is a very understandable, comprehensive and affordable course for each person. This knowledge and some skills will help every person whose activity at least somehow intersects with the subject of negotiations. Even if you sell a house, a car and any other real estate or thing - this course is indispensable for you. Thanks to the University of Michigan and the professor for this course!
Dr. Siedel is a true Master! I enrolled in the course because I am in Sales and I engage in negotiations on a daily basis. the course was so engaging that my wife(nurse by occupation) ended up listening almost to the whole course with me! The course addressed a lot of questions that I run into on a daily basis such as how do I enlarge the pie? what is the other side interest? etc' and elucidated techniques  that I am using. Thank you Dr. Siedel!!!
Mr. Siedel is a great instructor and with all the real-life experiences and examples, it has been an excellent course to participate in. Even for those who are not from the relative technical background, it definitely will be an enjoyable journey. I had so much fun and learned a great deal from him. Also, I must mention that the stories used in his lectures were cherries on top of the cake!I wish to meet you some day and thank you in person!
This course is totally amazing. I would have never guessed that I knew so very little about negotiations even though my first degree was Procurement and Supply Chain Management which treats negotiations as a major subject. I believe the approaches used by Prof. Siedel is one of a kind. I felt very involved in the whole process and at the end it really didn't feel like there was any pressure at all while learning because it was also very fun.
I have thoroughly enjoyed this online course and have been able to broaden my skill set and understanding accordingly. This course has given me the tools and knowledge to plan out future negotiations and dispute management which is crucial in the field I work in.Thank you for taking the time to create such a vast and detailed course.As an international student, I also enjoyed learning more about Michigan and the core focus of the University.
It was a great learning experience for me. Now that I have completed 2 online courses, I can say that few things are important in a course. 1) Content of Course. 2) Balanced Weekly Workload 3) Instructor. This is a very good course. All 3 essentials are present in this. The content is really helpful and it has 2 bonuses- 1) The negotiation exercise 2) The final exam. I really enjoyed this course and urge everyone to join this.
A very good course, held by a very clear and understandable professor with a really good way of teaching and explaining such a complex argument. This is really helpful not only applied to business but also in everyday life.After this course i'm able to look at negotiations with a different perspective by understanding the scenario in which i'm involved.I suggest this course to all the people, it gives you a boost in your life
I am really thankful to Respected Mr. George Siedel for giving such a wonderful explanation in the entire course & I really thank you from bottom of my heart to bring things in such a simple manner which will surely benefit me in my negotiations in the future . I hope I would see you someday if time permits me to visit Michigan Unversity. I wish I would shortly enroll for some more courses. Regards Merchant +919999902442
Great course, covering a lot of theory that is also applicable in real life. Have enjoyed the teaching style of Prof. Siedel very much. Friendly, clear, complete, to the point. The practice exercise of week 6 is a great addition that makes it clear how you can use what you've learned. The only (minor) remark is that the course has obviously some principles funded on American law, which aren't perse applicable in Europe.
I really can recommend this course to everyone who wants to structure
 his negotiations.I would describe myself as an experienced business negotiator,
 but the scientific approach to issues you encounter before, in and 
after a negotiation really helped me to improve my personal results.Mr Siedel is a very good speaker, who gives very realisitc and sometimes fun examples.I am really glad that I have found this course!
I am so glad I signed up for this course. I love the topic and has made some other courses around the World, but this one has been exceptional. Highly recommend it, I like the interactive way in what  Professor Siedel has deliver every topic, he did cover all the subjects that matter not just for citizens in the US but around the Globe, and listening and watching him felt like if I was in  class listening to him.
The course was very useful and comprehensive,I learned the skills needed to manage the negotiations logically and scientifically. The professor was wonderful in putting up the materials and clarifying it >Thank you Dr.Georgr Siedel and I invite you to visit Mesopotamia one day, I'll be honored to welcome you.Best regards,Mohammed H Shukur Senior engineer and project manager at the ministry of electricity / Iraq
Really good introductory course to negotiation, clearly defines the underlying principles of negotiation and links it to basic human psychology and then gives a practical interpretation with good examples of how these two areas can be leveraged to make you a better negotiator. It kept me engaged and interested throughout and I have emerged with an additional set of skills to help me throughout my future career.
This course has greatly enhanced my ability to see, not only business deals but, everyday life deals (decisions) from the perspective of the other person; looking beyond obvious details to seeing the big picture. Life is not always a struggle, depending on perspective and with the power of negotiation. I love the lessons from House on the Elm street.I believe i can negotiate better now. Thanks to Prof. Siedel.
I was never a fan of online course but this is course is on another level. Every video was a pack of complete new surprises and skills. I never spend more than 1 hour in continous study but guess what i complete this course of 7 weeks in 14 days. This course really showed me that getting an A in business in alevels isn't everthing. And so in end all to thanks to Sir George for making such a wonderful course.
Professor George Siedel is a fantastic teacher. Although there were zero interactions with the professor, I felt appreciated. He is very inclusive in his teaching style and if I ever visit The University of Michigan, I hope I get the chance to meet him. In addition, the course has taught me many skills that I think will be of great value in various parts of my life, both professional and private. Thank you!
As an outside salesman I believed my negotiation skills to be somewhat polished. Boy was I wrong! While through experience I've begun to use a minor amount of techniques taught in the course there was a vast amount of new information for me to pour over and learn. The systematic approach to negotiation also very helpful and has provided me a mental framework from which to become a better negotiator.
Our daily life requires better decisions and we often miss out because of lack of knowledge (my people perish because of lack of knowledge), this has brought more light to my personal and career development. I encourage everyone to dive into this skills for the world needs better negotiators like you doubting the relevance. Yes, of course you need it and its boldly written Successful Negotiation.
A profound and stretching course that expects participants to challenge themselves and their assumptions, and ultimately raises their negotiation's capabilities. Immensely practical and potentially transformational. Prof Seidel teaching style is friendly, approachable and humorous (but requires some patience as he develops his arguments at a certain pace). You will enjoy and learn from it. A lot.
I have taken the course and passed the final exam. To tell the truth it was great experience to take it. I got a knowledge and skills I had not got before. Now I feel more prepared to start negotiations not only in business, but also in politics. Many thanks to professor Siedel, Michigan University staff, and Coursera for having this wonderful opportunity to participate and take this course.
Thank You Coursera, University of Michigan team and the great instructor Sir George Siedel. It was a wonderful course.This course taught me a lot of things which would help me in life. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to be a perfect negotiator.Some suggestions - the only suggestion which i would give is if there are more negotiation assessments like "The House on Elm Street" .
Really interesting, changed my point of view on negotiations, i had never taken a course like this, and it gave me a big panorama about all the tools that can be used, and how to get a better result while doing a negotiation. Even though is  a 20 hrs course (more or less) you feel prepared to identify the tools used by the counterparts in the negotiation and how to get things on your favor.
An exceptional course!!To be honest, first I thought how would anyone teach negotiation online and had doubts about the efficacy. But, as when I started the course my perspective changed and I am sure everyone will get involved in the course and the comprehensive examples given during the lectures. Overall, I recommend everyone to take part in this wonderful experience. Happy negotiation!!
This course has been very enlightening and thought provoking. There are so many things we think we did right as we made ourselves to feel we had impeccable skills but after completion of this course i realize how much i had lost in previous negotiations although i walked out of the negotiation as the smiling guy!Thanks to MOOC, University of Michigan and the especially to Professor Siedel.
For a while I was a professional salesmen in the solar industry and this course helped me greatly to close more deals. Understanding the fundamentals of negotiation are a necessary skill for any entrepreneur, businessman, or anyone who is looking to take their communication skills to the next level. I highly suggest this course for anyone who wants to make an income over six figures.
FIrst of all I want to thank professor George Siedel. The course is very well structured and all the strategies and skills are all very interesting and useful. This course has provided me with more new knowledge and has given me a real liking for the challenge and a genuine desire. It has given me a new perspective on how to focus every negotiation. It has given me self-confidence.
First, I want to say thank you for Coursera for the gold chance! You are doing a great job in the world how they make learning in our hands from worldwide!

For Mr. George Siedel Thank you so much for your teaching us you make a big difference in me. Now I can practice  negotiation, really thank you I'll always remember who teaching me this course. I'm so grateful.. God bless you
An exceptional course on negotiation skills, I am very honored to have had the opportunity to study such a key subject in becoming a great entrepreneur. The videos were extremely helpful and the reading material was to the point. The teacher was very engaging and no video felt too long. Would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to master their negotiation skills
i highly recommend to all those who want to be entrepreneur , businessman. engineer.this course contain lots of practical examples ,it will help you to understand concepts and terms.and also the instructor is  great , he is very knowledgeable person and he speak words which are easy to follow , so if you are from foreign  (just like me) you can understand his English easily .
I absolutely love my learning experience from this course. I am usually stunned at the twists and turns on issues I thought I knew how I to handle! The materials shared were great reads and loaded with lifelong learning nuggets. I'm really grateful for the strategies and  skills of negotiation I have learned through this course. I am committing to Mastery. Highly recommended.
Basically, I'm interested in this area of learning related to negotiation. Besides, I really love this course, not that theoretical or confusing like what I had before. The examples and small tips could be useful in logical thinking and in real life. I suppose that these knowledge and skills would be applied to my study and business later. Moreover,  our professor is so nice.
Es muy bueno, y el profesor es un encanto, el curso no es nada si el, muy metódico y con una mentalidad muy ágil, se explica muy bien, hace una conexión emocional de la teoría con los casos ejemplos. No es fácil hallar profesores con los que te sientas cómodo y nutrido teóricamente, este curso me gusta,  llena mis expectativas, me estimula incluso me estimula a aprender mas.
coursera team really you are make my dreams come true thank you very much Mr. George Siedel it was very important and fruitful course for me i will use what i learnt in this practical course like the psychological tools  and contract information, how creating BATNA ,Calculating zopa thank very much coursera  for supporting us and i'm looking for great future with you
As I have come across this course ilearn different and various negotiation skills and strategies as negotiation is helpful in day today life as well as in professional life it is very important to understand various negotiation skills and this course is perfect for this job by doing this one can easily learn various Strategies and skills for successful negotiation
Professor George Siedel is absolutely mesmerizing. I have tried online courses earlier but lost patience while watching lecture videos. Here I got captivated in the Introduction lecture itself and has to go on for binge watch all lectures, completed the course within a week. Will try to absorb the concepts more deeply by reading his book "Negotiating for Success"
Thank you so much for this course. The development and design of the 
content makes clear to understand a fearful topic that certainly by studying it can 
lead to success for the ones involved on any kind of negotiations.I feel very lucky and grateful of having learned about negotiation matters on this course developed by University of Michigan and George Siedel.
The professor truly has knowledge about the topics reviewed in this course and inspires one to learn the content on the course. His charisma and enthusiasm gives this course an extra value for the students. He uses simple real life examples for complex topics that makes it easy for one to understand the concepts even without a previous background in these topics.
I'm an undergraduate student from Serbia and I liked this course very much. Professor is great, he gives examples all the time and perfectly summarizes every lecture. It is noticeable how much effort is put into making this course possible. I learned a lot of new things that I can use not only in my future career, but in everyday life. Thank you!Ana, 22 years old
I had an amazing experience taking this course. I am an Attorney so I thought I was already a good negotiator but this course made me realize I had a lot to learn and I did. I am so happy and looking forward to using the knowledge I have acquired in real life situations. I must also mention that the tutor was amazing. Thank you so much Professor George Siedel!!!
Professor Siedel was an excellent instructor and he has inspired me to pursue my career as well, I will definitely enroll for any future courses of his for sure. Because of the course, I finally found what I want to do once I graduate from Law school. I strongly recommended this course for everyone, especially lawyers who are interested in running a business.
This was an excellent course - really well explained and filled with lots of practical examples and opportunities to reinforce your learning. I also happen to think that the format of the exam was structured such that one couldn't simply guess their way through it which means that it ultimately encouraged a level of understanding that many other MOOCs do not.
This is possibly the best course I have ever taken up. All credit to Prof. George Siedel. It has given me a deep insight into how ethically a negotiation has to be carried out. I strongly recommend this course for Supply Chain professionals as I am one myself.Thank you professor for your valuable advise and tips. I shall cherish this knowledge forever.
Good class, good topic for all to have exposure to.  I did find the book and the videos too repetitive.  Would highly recommend you pick up another book on negotiation to read along with the video's if you, like me, need the repetition of ideas but hate to feel like you are just reliving the video.  I used Leigh Thompson "the truth about negotiation"
Professor George is really impressive. He has worked with quite big names in this field and this course is like learning from the best person available. It is a good choice of course. His teaching methods are engaging. I am very busy person but I would ask no matter how much busy you are you have to look into this course if you are doing negotiation.
El curso me ha parecido brillante en su planteamiento y ejecución, y magnífico tanto por su contenido como por la forma en que se ha desarrollado por parte del profesor. Además, no se ha echado de menos que no hubiera sido presencial, dando la sensación de estar en todo momento delante del profesor, a su lado. Desde luego, es un curso que invita a
This course provides a good framework and tools for successful negotiations. I think the professor did a great job in explaining the content and providing real life scenarios.I would have liked that the sildes provide more content in case you want to review it at a later time. But overall, I had a good and interesting time while doing the course.
As a sales person, this course helped me to look at the negotiation process in a more organized way. The topics are selected and presented in a very efficient way to ensure that learner will have a complete overview of negotiation. moreover, it give you enough introduction and motivation to go after learning about specific topics in more details.
Easily one of the best courses I have done so far. The professor is clearly very knowledgable and teaches you things in the right way. The examples he gives, the way he makes you think is something I did not expect to go so well. All in all had a great amount of learning and hope to be able to use it to the fullest in my real life situations.
As a MBA aspirant, this course was really really beneficial for me. I always had a keen interest in developing my negotiations skill and this course has facilitated with the most prominent and knowledgeable lessons. I would like to thank George Siedel for his extraordinary teaching skills and wisdom. I would definitely recommend this course.
I think its an interesting and so profitable course for a different range of students or professionals, and also I have to add that the English used by the Professor is very clear and understandable for people of non-official English speaking countries. I highly recommend this course for all type of students/ professionals of different ages.
I never realized that there is an art to negotiation. Often, I would feel at a disadvantage when negotiating as I did not have the experience or the confidence to say what I wanted from a negotiation. I have now learnt some techniques that will help build up my confidence during negotiation and I hope to practice those skills even more!
An excellent course, with plenty of practical examples!  Another good aspect is that it touched on the legal aspects of negotiation and contracts, which is important since so many types of negotiation have a formal and legal element.  There's even an opportunity to practice a realistic negotiation with other students via video calling.
After successful completion of Successful Negotiation: Essential strategies & Skills course, I can vividly testify of the essentiality of this course to every individual. Mr. George Siedel was able to teach every fundamental aspects, used a negotiation assessment to recapitulate everything he has taught, leaving every stone unturned.
This course was amazing! I enjoyed a great deal the class pace, content, examples, illustrations, and readings. It is my first on-line class in Coursera and I am really happy I started with this class because now I am totally addicted. I want to thank George Siedel and the staff that helped him create this on-line content. Well done!
This is one the best courses I have ever taken. George Siedel is a fantastic teacher who keeps you engaged throughout the course.  The way he summed up the entire course in the last module is simply genius. This helped me recollect and pass the exams with ease. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to do a course on negotiations.
Recommend to anyone who has just 20 extra minutes in their day. It is an extremely useful tool no matter what area you work or specialize in. The course is easy and well presented. I am studying Business Administration with a BA degree and I find that this class can be even more helpful than some of the ones taught at my University.
This course has gone way beyond my expectations! A very interesting and helpfull course for all professionals and university student! Professor Siedel makes it very easy to follow and provides practical solutions to negotiations tactics and strategies! Highly recommend this is by far the best thing i did during COVID-19! Thank you
El curso es excelente, de hecho me gustaría seguir profundizando en el tema. Felicidades a la Universidad de Michigan y al Maestro Siedel por compartir tanto conocimiento. Congrats to Michigan University and Mr. Siedel for sharing this important knowledge. I'm very happy for taking this course, and hope to take more in the future.
Great Job ,Prof Siedel, I was reminded that to be a great negotiator , honesty ,integrity and ethics must come naturally. Just after completion ,i won my first interest based negotiation with my 3 yr old infant grand daughter with her tantrum replaced with a smile........ Eustace Abraham  [Close Protection Agent -Toronto Canada]
Hello SIrThanks for being here helping most of us that can not travel over there to follow this importantand powerful course. Thanks to platforme Coursera owner who give me this opportunity.It is one of most difficult course I never foolow, this is why I am so proud to have successful finish itNow I am moving toward to practice.
I am excited about completing this
course, it has changed my perspective of negotiation and their processes and also about the online
courses. While taking the course, I had the opportunity to talk to people from
other countries and do practical exercises with them. that was good to maintain
de motivation at the top. thanks
Great course! Everything is perfectly structured, and thanks to George, it's easy enough to assimilate. We use some tools described in the course in negotiations without thinking about the theoretical foundations. The course provides an understanding of these fundamentals and useful tools for negotiating. Thank you, George!
De los mejores cursos que he llevado en Coursera y de MOOC's en general. Muy buen material con varios casos y ejemplos prácticos. El profesor explica muy bien y tiene amplia experiencia en la materia. Definitivamente me ha ayudado a tener mejores herramientas y conocimientos avanzados para aplicar en negociaciones futuras.
I have learned a lot from this course. Thanks to Professor George Siedel and University of Michigan to give me an opportunity to complete this course. I'm feeling proud to become a part of this reputed university and I hope one day I will be a student of masters program in University of Michigan and fulfill my desire.
This is one of the best course offered by this University and Sessions and entire course was quite  enlightening  & enriching experience by me. I fully recommend this course to whosoever wants to upgrade skills particularly on Negotiation. Instructor, Mr. George Siedel was very clear in explaining different concepts.
This is one of the best courses I have come cross, it lightened me up to the realities of what I think I know. It also revealed the essence of writing down something as an agreement in a any form business negotiation.I am not just happy , I am delighted by the kind and humor at which Dr.George Seigel teaches. Kudos.
Este es un excelente curso que te aporta una gran cantidad de conocimiento y habilidades necesarias para la negociación. Aunque muchos de los casos y esquemas planteados son propios de los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de los conceptos se pueden trasladar al entorno de otros países, por ejemplo México,  donde yo vivo.
This is course which in every day to day life but when we are negotiating for our company its becomes important to do in ethical and systematic ways.  This course has really help in understand BATNA, ADR and many more . It's very informative and Collection of all points for developing a skill. Thanks George Siedel
I learned a lot about negotiation from this class. What I learned would be useful not only in my career but also in my personal life. I'm really glad that I took this course over other choices. I thank Professor Siedel for the wonderful lecture, and I do also like to thank Samsung for giving me this opportunity to
The course is really good. I have learnt how to negotiate in various instances.  All the lectures and speaking style is really superb.  Thanks to Coursera for providing opportunities to attend the eminent professor's lectures through this online platform.  Thanks to Prof. George Siedel for his excellent lectures.
Lots of useful information! I loved the examples on Framing and how the use of negative/positive statements makes us become risk adverse or risk seeking. I had never thought of this! The videos were very clear and informative. I will definitely implement my learnings in my negotiations going forward. Great class!
i like every part of this course and mostly how the professor Siedel make it clear for all of us that study from country that no speak english. just the chapter about contract I think isn't oriented for all the country but it is necessary to understand an important part of make a negotiation and a valid contract
This is one of the best courses available on coursera. It provides valuable insight to the world of negotiation and how can you use these skills and techniques to become a great negotiator. It also helps us to know about the law system and how it functions and the legal and ethical requirements of negotiation.
This is an excellent course to learn principles, skills and strategies to apply in everyday negotiation opportunities that will enhance your experience and the results that you get. I strongly recommend this course because of the content, the way it is presented and the experience and skills of the instructor.
This is indeed; an exceptional course that can only bring more value to our skills and on-going life and professional experience.This course deserve a flawless 5 Star rating!!!I really hope that Professor George Siedel will provide and share new materials in the near future.Thank you Professor George Siedel!
Little did I know that I knew absolutely nothing about the negotiation processes before. Not only was I able to look back and evaluate some of my life situations and their outcomes, now I feel prepared and confident to enter negotiations!   Thank you  Professor Siedel from the bottom of my heart! irina Hott
This is a terrific course and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who feels he is not a very good negotiator. In particular, I believe that people in the technology fields would most benefit from this course as they are typically weaker in the soft skills departments than other people in other fields.
A very very good, excellent professor!!! He laid out all the theory in a very clear way. And I loved the tests and the negotiation assignment, which he debriefed fully while relating all aspects to what we learned and explained it all. Very useful course if you want to improve your skills in negotiation.
This was an excellent course, I learned things that I wish I'd know 20 years ago. I struggled a bit with the final exam and would have liked the option for an answer key to help with a few of the problems that I had trouble with.  That said, the student forums were very helpful in resolving my questions.
As a administration professional, this course improved my career in global sphere of negotiation. Teaching keys, tactics and many others ways to achieve what the best alternative to conduct situations.
I have no doubt about this awesome learning method.
Thank you Coursera!
Thank you Mr. George Siedel!
Very much enjoyed the class, well organized, presented the material very well and concepts were easy to understand and even to apply.  What was very enjoyable was the negotiation scenario where you were able to use what you learned and get feedback how well you were able to apply the lessons learned.
I was fortunate enough to learn  negotiation skills from Professor George Siedel , as his explanation for these topics is in so simple and practical way , you are not lost in details but reach your end goal with ease. I would also thank Coursera & University Of Michigan  for designing such course.
Very practical and useful on the real case. You can take a retrospective view of previous negotiation and finding the weakness and the blind point. Also you will have new perspectives on different negotiation. It is very enlightened course on my future negotiations. Thanks Professor George Siedel.
Very happy I took this course. George is very engaging and clearly passionate. Theory is matched with practical application. Information covers a wide variety of topics involved in negotiation without being too complex for the average person to understand or relate to. Highly, highly recommended!
It is incredible how Proffesor Siedel manage to turn a MOOC into a really dynamic and practical course. Every topic is explained with daily life examples which makes easier to understand the concepts. Now I feel more prepared to perform negotiations and eager to continue developing my weak spots!
First time completing a MOOC, and perhaps the best education from a MOOC I can get. Professor Siedel surely made the course easy to understand and intercept it with stories that make it interesting. I felt I have expanded in person after taking this course. Thank you UoM/Coursera and Dr. Siedel!
Learning a lot, Since I am very passionate about the field of supply chain management/procurement and supply, it was one of the reasons that I chose to do this course. It compliments my current field of study and gives a wealth of knowledge that I can apply to my day to day functions at work.
Курс очень практический, многие знания можно применять в реальной жизни, на работе, всевозможных сделках. Педагог - профессионал с большой буквы, очень многое знает, но при этом все доступно и легко объясняется. Лекции "живые", нет желания уснуть, хорошие видео-нарезки. Обязателен к изучению!
Really impressive! I've benefitted a lot from just taking the course because it's a realm that I've never encountered before, yet I haven't done some spcific real-life pratice.I bet this mind-changlleging course will continue to boarden my horizen and equip me with a big negotiation picture.
I have learnt a lot from this course. I thought negotiation should be a natural thing for you to know if you are in business or deal with people but now I have come to know that it is more than 'dragging' who will win/lose. But now I know better. Thank you very much for the knowledge gained.
course content was extremely good but week 7 exam was not up to the mark. I attempted the exam twice to came to know that "two of the above" means first and 2nd option not 3rd and last option. Also, some of the questions were very confused hard to understand. Test needs very much betterment
Brilliant course. The practice exercise in the end truly was an eye opener, and made me re think my approach to any negotiation. Furthermore, throughout the course, George kept sharing intriguing examples that even standalone are such valuable lessons. Thoroughly satisfied with the course!
Professor Siedel makes great work of shattering lots of common logical fallacies that we use daily when we enter negotiations or avoid them. Negotiations is a universally applicable tool for a successful career and life in general. Don't hesitate to enroll, this was a pleasant ride for me.
Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills is an excellent course that provides useful information on the most important principles of negotiation. The course is well-paced, and well taught by Prof. Seidel. His delivery is understandable yet thorough. Great course all around!
Very good and engaging approach to negotiation, delivered by an outstanding professor. The course covered a broad number of topics, using great examples and an excellent unique final negotiation activity. Highly recommended to everyone who wishes to strengthen their negotiation skills.
Cool course! It's simple and easy to understand. It is highly recommended not only to professionals, lawyers, agents and businessmen but also to other average persons. A round of applause for George Siedel, "Negotiation Team" and Coursera! I hope many people will enroll on this course.
One of the best courses I've ever done. The material is very interesting, well prepared and easy to follow. I've never realised how much I wanted to learn about negotiating until I've started to dig deeper into this course. For me that's the hallmark of a superb learning experience.
Like many, for a well-known reason, I decided to try courses online. This was the first experience at Coursera.Very interesting and useful course for everyone who wants to improve their negotiation skills and learn new about negotiation strategiesThanks for this great opportunity
In my job (and real life) i negotiate almost every day, this course gave me important tips and tools in order to manage future negotiation.Dr. Seidel is a great teacher, i really admire his way of explaining and i hope i have an opportunity to follow some others lessons by him.
The class provided tools and resources for negotiations I have not been exposed to before.  It helped me understand the techniques available to become more successful in the negotiation process.  Dr. Siedel is excellent at delivering the content in an easy to understand method.
I am highly grateful that I have accomplished my second course which gave huge enjoyment and valuable knowledge. In this course I have completely gained a lot of information and tools in order to improve my negotiation skills for my personal and professional lives. Thank you !
Thanks a lot to all people who worked on this course!I should say that this was my first experience, the first time I took part in an online courses. I was pretty happy!Thank you very much for your knowledge and useful negotiation tactics, they will definitely be useful to me!
Very helpful course. Easy to follow even for people with scientific background and no previous knowledge in business and law. Prof. Siedel is a great lecturer, keeping the interest level always high with samples and problem-solving exercises. I have learned a lot! Thank you!
Esse curso já me colocou à frente de muitas pessoas, seu conteúdo é fantástico e bem explicado com grandes técnicas de negociações e tem uma qualidade ótima, valeu muito estudar aqui!!! É show, parabéns a todos os envolvidos, especialmente meu mestre George Siedel, obrigado.
Very interesting and usefull course. It has many surprising examples. I'm very happy that I watched this cours. I hope I can apply this knowledg. I even fell out of reality a little, I got over the routine at work when I watched the cours. Very interesting. Good luck to you.
I would definitely recommend this course, hence it is easy to follow, but still can give a nice framework how to prepare for a negotiation. You also have the chance to realize some of your weaknesses and strong skills with regards to a negotiation. All in all, worth to try !
George Siedel, You are one of the best teacher of my life. I enjoyed your teaching. I can say I learn many things from you and what I learn from you today, will stay with me forever because of your examples, related stories and wit. Thank you, Sir. Stay safe and play for me.
Negotiation is never ending process, as we live on earth. First i thought it will be very difficult to learn negotiation skill and tactics , but the way sir George teach, i really salute to my teacher. His unique and wide experience will help me a lot in future. Thanks sir.
I enjoyed this course very much and have learn a lot, although I am not sure how much of what I have learned from this course will be put in use in my life. Professor Siedel is a great teacher on this subject. I will definitely recommend this course to someone who need it.
El enfoque sencillo y de muy alto contenido técnico hace de este curso muy pertinente para profesionales dedicados a actividades donde va continuamente implícita una negociación de alto nivel, agradezco la oportunidad de haber realizado este curso, altamente recomendable!
I learnt a lot with this course that provides methods and lots of exemple on how negotiation is being prepared, done and evaluated ! Greta teacher and pace of the course  to study with 2-3hours per week which makes it compatible with on-goign full time workload. Tks !
Good course.  I feel I got a lot out of it to fine-tune some of my tactics.  One thing that I would find useful - there are many terms introduced throughout the course.  It would help if there was a reference link to jargon where I could look up the meaning of terms.
The instructor delivers 'common sense' but vital and often overlooked insights on the aspect of negotiation. Before I finished 'week three' of the module I could see for myself that my negotiation skills have greatly improved. This is way beyond a theoretical course.
A very practical course with many real life examples and case studies. Never boring and excellent presentation by the very experienced Prof. George Siedel. Thank you University of Michigan and Professor for giving me this opportunity to learn a very valuable course.
Great contents, fantastic teacher. I advise you to buy the book, I really enjoyed reading it. This is my first course on Coursera platform, I prefer EdX but that's an opinion. I would like an additional course taught by the same teacher, with more advanced contents.
Wonderful course. If you are understanding negotiations, this course is the place to be. George Siedel gives a very patient and clear explanation on the terminologies and concepts. Very useful indeed. You will have fun and it will never be boring. Thanks Courseera.
Curso fantástico! Além de abrir um horizonte ante negociações corriqueiras como negociar com negociar com nossa esposa, com o caixa da padaria, com o motorista do Uber até grandes negociações que envolvem valores consideráveis. Sou muito grato pela oportunidade!!!
I am glad that I participated in this course. Everything was clear, lectures were interesting, a lot of tips and cases to ilustrate theory and practical exercise. The final test was difficult, but if something comets too ease, we do not appreciate it. Recommended!
That was my first online course and it's perfect. There were some issues probably because I'm Russian and this course in English and I intentionally didn't use Russian subtitles but that was my choice. Very pleasant lector. Thanks for this time, that was awesome!
Great materials, well delivered, and overall construct of the class was wonderful. Easy to review 1 weeks lessons to comprehension before moving to the next. At times the videos may seem dry, but the content is 10/10, and often is the case with the best theories.
Exceptional. This course made me realize that with sufficient knowledge and tools, one can make a usually stressful event such as negotiations and disputes be less stressful and even value adding to both parties. Thank you to everyone who arranged this course. .
Excellent Course on the essentials of Negotiation. George did a great work on educating us on some of the underlying concepts of Negotiation. My knowledge in this subject has gone from zero to one!! Very satisfied with the course overall and highly recommended!!
Easy to understand and practical examples for students ..Pace of the course was well balanced giving you the opportunity to learn at your own convenience ..overall something that one should go in for if he / she is part of the management or want to be ..Cheers
Many useful insights provided in this Negotiation course with Professor George Siedel, who keeps a very clear communication throughout the whole course. For someone with little to no knowledge in strategies for negotiating, this comes across as very valuable.
Very important practical course for people from all walks of life. After all we all negotiate on a regular basis. I greatly enjoyed this course.  Dr. Siedel's delivery of the material is very clear and engaging. Thank you Dr. Siedel for preparing this course.
Thank you very much for this course. It offered insightful details into how negotiations should be structured as well as the many different types of negotiations. I learned a lot of very useful information that better equips me for negotiations in the future.
I have so far, loved the examples given in this course ! The teacher gets you to be very interactive by asking you to answer some questions in the videos. The subject is interesting, and the way the courses are is a good way to make you quick learn about it.
Being a Sales manager for more than a decade, I came across multiple strategies and methods that I was unaware of in negotiations. I am sure this is going to help me in the future for my career in handling my corporate clients & key accounts. Thanks again!
I would like to thank Coursera and the University of Michigan for this amazing resource. The course is a great opportunity to acquire essential knowledge to better prepare and perform in negotiation situations, and to be more efficient on daily situations.
I really enjoyed the online course. I thought it was well planned and layed out, easy for me to follow. The work load(h.w. & test)was just enough, so i could finish everything with enough time, learn about the topics and not feel over loaded and rushed.
Most valuable and informative course which enhance our skill and knowledge in  sucessful negotiation and strategies and skill which will upgrade our level in working sectors in designing principles and  implementing the  ideas gained through this course
I enjoy this course, I recommended to anyone who wishes to improve or learn the art of selling! I would change the peer grading because you have to wait until someone grade your work. It would be better if the work is graded by the mentor in my opinion.
Great course to get insight and knowledge in Negotiation skills and strategy, Very much appreciated the case and examples quoted in the course. They are Very practical.  More important is enriched my mindset in always thinking bigger pie in real world.
The course was interesting and instructive. I had to learn and I hope to apply. I don't think this course should be improved, because the information is applicable, it is a useful course and the trainer's training is excellent. I recommend this course.
Very interesting course and useful! Thanks to this course I've realized all the mistakes I was making when entering a negotiation.The professor is amazing! I found the explanation by example very useful.Easy to understand even for non-native speakers.
The lectures are fairly good. However the course could have been made more valuable by either providing the slides used in each module or  excerpts from the recommended book could have been provided instead of just an Amazon link to purchase the book.
Great information on how to improve negotiation skills, as well as some valuable strategies. Presented in a professional and light-hearted manner. The recommended book isn't necessary, as the material is gone over in the lectures, but is still handy.
It's a pretty nice course wherein one gets to learn a lot. I was only disappointed at one point during week 6 when I was expected to participate in a real negotiation but wasn't able to find a partner on the forum. But in general it's a good course.
The course is really amazing and there are lots of new theory and assignments which is also an excellent way of teaching the students during this era. And I'm really thankful to Professor George who taught me and all other students for this course.
Excellent video lectures and well prepared textbook together provide a rich context to understand the best practices of Negotiation, Alternative Dispute Resolution and Deal Making strategies that apply in many aspects of business and personal life.
Great topic, great tools to and advises. I love the examples and the videos. The instructor clearly stated the topic, the outline, the goals, the results. The book was a great investment. Helped me to easily find the information I was looking for.
The course gave to me very useful and important knowledges about a negotiation process. Mr. Siedel is a perfect teacher! There was a lot of different examples, real stories from his experience etc. Thank you so much. With best wishes from Ukraine!
This course is very useful not only in commercial negotiation but also in daily affairs, such as dealing with office disputes through mediation or arbitration. I think those methods and concepts are quite pragmatic and really enlightened me a lot.
I found this course to be absolutely fantastic and very relevant to real-world applications. The learnings in this course are applicable to interactions in almost any industry and between employees in any position. I highly recommend this course!
Dear Team,The course provided by University of Michigan was the equally important as my core subjects. It was a great experience be the one of the student of this course. Good work by the mentor. Thank you for providing me such great opportunity.
Effective, simple and very useful practically. Mr. Seidel is very pleasant listening to and felt listening to him more and more. The realistic examples given by him are interesting and very effective in remembering these concepts for a long time.
This course helped me to learn about Negotiation analysis,BATNA and how to use psychological tools  and avoid traps during any negotiation as well as ADR concepts and ADR tools which is helpful for any type of organisation or in day to day life.
Simple but not easy. This is well presented course with very practical content. I was able to put it to work straight away. I now approach negotiations with much more structure (and confidence). Looking forward to making the larger for everyone!
Very nice course, that can be used in everyday life at simpler negotiations, or also during more important negotiations. Learns you to plan your negotiation and think about the other side point of view. I would definitely recommend this course.
I love it! Learned a lot from this course - there are many terms that was good to finally put words on.  I specially liked the small stories about negotiation situations. The negotiation with the House on Elm Street was really great. Thank you!
I never felt comfortable in doing negotations. COVID19 and its restrictions made me challenge myself. Now I understand the power and even more the possibilties of negotations. The professor was very knowledgable and did a great job. Thank you.
A very useful course taught by a knowledgeable and experienced professor. All the necessary skills to conduct and conclude a successful negotiation are well taught including the opportunity to practice your negotiation skills in an assignment.
One of the best courses I have taken on coursera. If you really want to improve your negotiation skills, I would highly recommend this course. The professor is amazing, he knows what he is teaching and seems very passionate about the subject
Really interesting, I will keep to check again this course, unfortunately negotiation is not part of my job so far, but I can always use with my boss if I need something! Thank you very much. Hope there is another course by Professor Siedel.
Excellent course. It was presented with such clarity by Professor Siedel. His extensive knowledge on the subject matter just jumps out at you. I am happy I did it. Will keep many of the checklists discussed in my pocket for future reference.
What a fantastic way to be introduced to the subject of strategies for successful negotiation. I appreciated the style of instruction along with the easy to length of this course. I look forward to expanding my understanding of the subject.
As a Federal Government executive who deals with administrative and civil cases and also an attorney, I found this class extremely helpful. I hope UM offers more related classes from both their prestigious business schools and law schools.
Thanks a lot for the inputs regarding negotiation. As a emergency manager coordinator I have to deal with a multidisciplinary scope of institutions and sometimes some negotiation skills are a major asset.Miguel Mendonça, (Azores, Portugal)
Very good course. learned many good tricks and tactics also very informative. I love how the professor breaks everything down and the fact that you can go back and review everything even before going to a job interview or buying anything.
I was expecting a course teaching some techiniques to persuade people, but instead I got a complete structured overview on the negotiation process.I was successfully applying this knowledge in my job even before finishing it.Awesome MOOC!
Negotiation is not about  persuade, it is more about to know other part and ask why, to know the real reason why the counterpart want that position, so you may have a solution to satify both side.Also the alternativ option is important.
Great stuff, loved the lessons and techniques that I can apply to my day to day.The Lecturer is great, lovely tone and 100% understandable, even for a non antive speaker (fluent, but non native).Got me interested on joning other courses
the course is very good for any one works in field of negotiation to solve the problem occurs  during the writing contract or implement the items mentioned in contract .really it was very effective time during study the course thank you
It took me little longer to complete due to hectic work schedule. But, this is really helpful with great and interest case studies as explained by Professor George.  I will recommend to go for this to learn best negotiation strategies.
Es war ein sehr lehrreicher Kurs. Hervorheben möchte ich die Partnerarbeit. Dort konnten wir eins-zu-eins das Gelernte vorbereiten und nutzen, zusätzlich durften wir auch erfahren, welche Werte eine gute Verhandlung hervorbringen kann.
Very useful course in order not only to improve your negotiations in business firms , but also good for your daily communications and deals.will let you decide correct choice's and prevent traps and failure's during your negotiations.
I went into this course with, what I felt was some level of negotiating skills.  But the lessons learned in this course really opened my eyes.  Wow!  I, seriously, feel much more confident going into any negotiation now.  Thank you!
Excellent content. I felt elevated in this area and can enter any negotiation with confidence. I loved the Professor, he kept it interesting an I always had to keep my paper an pen close to answer his quick questions. EXCELLENT!!!!!
Thank you Professor Siedel, it was really a very interesting course. This course helped me look at situations specially deal making in a better light. I can now crack better deals with clients and can also hope to get a better job!
It was an amazing experience all through the course. Specially the way our instructor Mr.Gorge Seidel interacted in this online course was wonderful.I am Thankful To University Of Michigan for providing such a golden opportunity .
I was really delighted to have attended this course. I found the content extremely insightful and when presented by Mr. Siedel, highly experienced, meticulous and truly charismatic professor it is definitely one top-level course.
Excelente curso con un valioso aprendizaje que trasciende no sólo en nuestro ámbito profesional, sino también en nuestro ámbito personal en nuestros diferentes roles como padre, hijo, esposo y demás. Es Imprescindible para todos.
One of the most useful courses I've ever had...It helped me in empowering my abilities and hone my skills. Also, highlighted many points which I didn't notice before..Thanks from the heart for this incredible course :)Tarek Tawil
The best. It gave a better understanding and scope of knowledge that is essential in having a successful negotiation especially that I needed this in preparation for making business deals and sorts.  So satisfying and enriching!
A very useful and practical course. Every topic covered has a significant use in daily life. This course is also a perspective builder for me. I'm surely gonna use the techniques I've learnt through this course in my daily life.
Awesome course, although I work with negotiations on my day to day this bring me to a different approach, an external view besides my corporate training - the use of the assessment was great as there is always room to improve!.
Great course... Mr Siebel, I think, is one of the best teacher that I ever have had, his experience in Negotiation issues give different points of view that probably it will facilitate negotiations in common day or in business.
I have been involved in negotiations in my job role quite frequently. I am feeling enlightened and empowered in the process of negotiation now. Looking forward to future negotiation opportunities with much more confidence now.
This course helps us understand where and how can we further improve our negotiation skills by structuring the approach and covering all essential checkpoints which are critical to a successful negotiation.. highly recommended
The course is very practical because you have negotiations in your whole life, negotiate in family, at work, etc. The course outline is very clear and i even find a study partner in Turkey. It is really a pleased experience.
Great learning experience. Topic is very relevant to our modern daily life. Definitely help me to improve my career and build a better relationship. Mr. Siedel's teaching is clear and precise, easy to understand. Thank you!
It's a great MOOC course and instructor's led very well throughout the  course . Thanks to George siedel sir, his explaining technique and examples clears concept very well.A must have transferable skill it is- Negotiation.
Excellent Course !! George sir has covered the concepts in detail & with relevant examplesGood number of exercises & cases covered throughout the videosNarration & training delivery method is awesome Thank you once again !
I really liked this course and the lector. Everything is clear, very interesting and very useful. Even if you aren't a businessman, this course will teach you how to communicate with different people on variety of matters.
Excellent course! I enjoyed every lesson taught and surely learned a lot with it! I strongly recommend it for every one interested in learning more about making businesses and starting up negotiations. A MUST WATCH COURSE!
Muy buen curso, cubre bastantes aspectos practicos que puede uno enfrentar en negociaciones reales, y tiene un ejercicio de negociacion real con otro participante, en el cual se aplica lo aprendido, muy util, recomendado!
Great course. Professor Siedel makes everything very clear, amazing teacher and communicator. I feel my knowledge in and ability to be successful during a negotiation has (at least) doubled! Would definitely recommend it.
The material covered was very useful and the organization of the course was exceptional. The videos tend to move slow at time but I really enjoyed this course and fully intend to put these practices into action very soon.
Loved this experience. I would recommend everyone to join the course or at least buy the book prof. George Siedel wrote on successful negotiation. He is an excellent teacher and you would learn a lot through this course.
Una excelente forma de aprender como negociar desde un producto hasta temas mas complejos como disputas entre dos empresas, un aprendizaje que me llevo de por vida y que claramente difundiré  entre mis colegas y amigos!
It was a delightful experience studying this course and learned many valuable concepts and tools regarding negotiation.  A big thanks to Professor George Siedel for making this course both interesting and knowledgeable.
This course teaches a skill that is crucial to working relationships, and is presented in an interesting and engaging manner. Everyone should have knowledge of this skill, and this course is an excellent way to get it!
Very good course.It was focused mostly on US-based low, so not everything applies to business in my country.I would be more than happy if I find training/hints section extended in the future.Anyway, I really enjoyed it
This was a very interesting course. It definitely helped me improve my negotiation skills, and it absolutely taught me a huge amount of material that I didn't know about. Great classes, very straightforward and clear.
O  curso é excelente. Achei a didática muito bem elaborada. Ele traz informações interessantes de uma maneira que não fica cansativa. Fazendo que o curso desenvolva bastante a cada semana que passa. Super recomendo!
Amei o curso, pude melhorar um pouco meu inglês, aprender muito sobre Direito Civil, mais especificamente contratual, além das técnicas de negociação, como também sobre mediação, arbitragem e litígio jurisdicional.
Participating in this course was a remarkable experience. Mr Shield is a great professor who structured the course in the most effective way possible. I feel 100% a better negotiator after completing this course.
Changed my life.  Literally.  I have saved so much money on things I would have paid full price for, without using tricks or manipulations; rather, strategies like anchoring, among many others.  Highly recommend!
What a mild mannered Professor, whose easy to follow. He gave ample examples to reinforce the concepts. Good course, but like with anything else, if you put in the work you’ll retain more and get better results!
Extremely useful course giving scientific framework to a discipline that was much assumed as "born-with" rather than to be mastered. As marketing professional, I found the course very on point for my daily work.
This really was an excellent course, and I'm quite happy to have invested the time and effort in it. Not a lot of courses out there that's been given for free that has this much quality and depth. It's organized and paced really well. I even feel more engaged with this professor, across a screen, than I have in some other face to face classes.  It's quite unfortunate that I've come across it during the time of this pandemic when funds are short to pay for the certification, but under (former) normal circumstances, this is definitely worth it.Looking forward to browsing and hopefully come across other ones in the future that I will feel the same way about. Kudos professor Siedel and the team. Thank you for the opportunity to learn and grow.
I took this course out of sheer curiosity and love for negotiation. I hail from a Psychology background and for the first time in my life, I heard about these business and law principles integrated with psychology. This was one of the absolutely best courses I have taken so far, it was challenging but in the right way- it helped me grow and gave me exposure to so many formal proceedings and challenges involved in devising and implementing a negotiation strategy and skillset. I loved the exam and the quizzes, the best part was that the questions were challenging- at least for someone like me- but they allowed me to expand my horizons and polish my skillset.
This was my first course on negotiation strategies.It is a very good course for beginners.The theoretical aspect might seem boring at times  but they are helpful in doing the negotiation exercise.I recommend watching it with breaks and making notes so that you have a to do list to review before a negotiation.The professor tells his anecdotes about his negotiation experiences which are fascinating and relevant ! A must try course :) I would also like to thank coursera for providing me financial aide for the course.I am really grateful.
Siedel is obviously knowledgable and highly respected and has a pleasant, engaging lecturing style. At first, I was apprehensive about the House on Elm Street exercise. However, I ended up learning about home sales and putting some of the skills I had learned in class to use, both of which were great. I also enjoyed working with my partner and getting to know some of the other students, all of whom live in places more or less different from the United States. Definitely a value, considering that the course itself is completely free!
Professor Siedel makes even the most complicated legal jargon simple to understand, to the extent that as a high-school student, I didn't need to Google individual terms to find out their meanings even once!I highly appreciate the way he has structured this course, as I entered it feeling that negotiation may be out of my league (academically, I have a background primarily in physics, chemistry and math) but as I finish it today, I am confident that armed with a few more practical negotiation sessions, I'll be able to hold my own!
Negotiation skills are very important for personal and professional life. Our guru , Our Professor George Siedel Sir has brought life to this course through real life examples, case studies, and even I came to know of how a negotiation, mediation takes place in reality. I am always excited to hear Siedel Sir's voice, his explanation , humour, important lessons for life. I loved the Golden rule: "Treat others the way you want to be treated". Sir I would personally like to greet you, thank you for sharing knowledge. .
This is an amazing course. I got to learn so much be it practical or theoretical knowledge. Successful Negotiation : Essential Strategies and Skills is surely going to hep me at professional as well as personal front. The intake that I got from this course would always help me to stay one step ahead than others. Prof. George Siedel made everything sound so easy and understandable that no difficulty was face through out the course. I would really like to recommend this course to many out there.
I really liked the professor and the materials of the class. He has a great personality and he breaks everything down in a way anyone can understand it. This review comes from the perspective of a person who has never formally taken a class in negotiation. The examples and videos were also extremely interesting and fun too. I took this class alone during COVID 19, so I didn't have a partner to do some of the exercises.   However, I still have a lot of fun taking the class.
This is a very well constructed on line program. It gives you a clear view about negotiations and provides you with key tactics and valuable information which you can use any time. Professor Siedel is awsome, very immediate and excellent in his explanations and examples. Never thought that negotiations should be so easy to follow and to understand. Great many thank to the University of Michigan and Professor Siedel for this excellent course.
This Course was an interesting introduction to negotiation techniques. Especially the psychological traps and the various practical examples were remarkable. The course also gave an introduction to important laws, concerning contracts and negotiation, which was interesting from an non US/common law standpoint.The professor could explain the material really well and the lectures were enjoyable and easy to follow. Thanks for this course!
Curso bem completo com excelente didática, velocidade e organização. O livro ajuda bastante na apresentação de informações e revê-las na sequência de vídeos ajuda a fixar os conceitos, bem como ter uma visão prática de suas aplicações. Aborda os diversos aspectos desde a apresentação das partes, passando pela negociação e encerrando em um contrato que prevê os possíveis disputas e suas resoluções. Vale o tempo e investimento :)
This course teaches strategies not only for negotiating but for life and the way we make decisions. It is very helpful, you will learn a lot even if you are not experienced or have very little understanding about negotiation; and the professor gives lots of examples for better understanding, keeps interesting every lesson and the way he speaks makes you stay focused. i would definitely take another course with him.
I'm an artist and the content covered is very much outside of my wheelhouse, how I process the world. It was a mind-bender; a welcome challenge. If you'd like to learn the basic skills/and an extensive, in-depth overview to attain a solid understanding of how negotiations work, I highly recommend Professor Siedel's course. Especially appreciated: his way of methodically “building a case” for the art of negotiation.
To put hair dye, hair color, all to promote to grow that way from growth. To always have hair growth from root and stop fault longest hair in here to not see their thing and to bring down soon after this. To always sweet on undo fault to think too comfortable that’s why theirs have been affected and some. To be laureates, all to do, to be on their home, anything they do, they don’t listen.
This course is well designed and structured for strategic negotiation. It has provided me what I was looking for. Clearly understandable relevant examples and real-time cases addressed by Professor George helped me to learn progressively. I also believe that using these tools and techniques (taught here) will help anyone who wishes to get benefitted both in personal and professional life.
Professor George Siedel teaches amazingly! The way the concepts have been explained gives you a crystal clear idea of the situations as well as makes you apply them to similar other situations. For a person from the health sciences background, this course was a smooth run without having to know any previous business negotiations skills. Looking forward to learning more!

Muy entretenido, el profesor se nota que sabe muchisimo. La semana 4/5 se vuelve un poco muy técnica y densa, se mete en muchos temas legales y de Ley Norteamericana que a lo mejor algunos nunca vamos a usar, pero a fines del curso termina siendo información adicional que tampoco diría que sobra.
One of the best MOOC  I've experienced.Narration has been wonderful and straight from the heart.Examples so relevant and memorable so as to make an everlasting impression.It is undoubtedly on of the best ever MOOC ever commissioned by Coursera. Thanks Dr Siedel , thanks Michigan.J SinghBangalore
Just a few hours into in and learned a busload of information of what would conventionally take several weeks. I can also see the passion of Professor Siedel, that he is really dedicated to teach others instead of making material profit. People like him are essential for educational progress!

Justo como el Profesor George menciona al inicio del curso, las negociaciones forman parte de cualquiera relación que  tengamos en la vida, ya sea familiar, con los amigos, con socios o en el ámbito laboral y por eso creo que este es uno de esos cursos que todos deberíamos tomar.
