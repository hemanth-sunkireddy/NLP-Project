It was hard to sit through these endless monologues of a wanna be "MOOC cool" Professor. The content of most lectures is generic stuff one can find on the Internet. I did not learn anything new. Since I'd paid for the certificate, I thought I'd finish it. I urge Prof. Joordens (and fellow Canadian citizen) to take some Critical Theory courses and review some of his damaging statements about: -Muslim women, -"black" kids of Harlem,-Schizophrenic homeless people "choosing to live in the streets and being unemployable because" [....Who would hire them?] (fyi: I live in Vancouver, BC)-or the very poor presentation of the "theory of attraction". An age old unfunded theory presented as the sole work on the topic.If Psychology is a science, then this course is not about Psychology. It is merely a wikipedia level of content. I am disappointed, but more than that, worried that an influential Professor of Psychology is lacking awareness of his own biases and is spreading this around. Is there anyone ever checking the content of these courses or do we just give these Professors license to say what they want. Should we even care? I think we must.A final note, the performative awesomeness of Canada and Canadians is plain repulsive. If this course is meant to reach out to everyone on the globe, can we please refrain from these nationalist comments on MOOC materials. It's is tasteless.
This course is really boring as compared to other psychology courses. Most instructors make the course and content engaging but this on is a really big disappointment.
This course is should be considered psychology 1 instead of introduction to psychology l.I feel deceived, it's confusing, Coursera has denied my refund.This is really bad, I feel disappointed, and want my money back,Maria Chaves
coursera me parece una muy buena herramienta pero algunos cusos se encuentran cmpletamente en ingles y habemos personas que no sabemos bien el idioma entonces se nos dificulta aprender
did not like the course at all.  That is why I decided to discontinue the course.
how do un enroll course
not effective so
tristemente quizá el curso es genial , pero aparece como traducido en esta;ol , pero todos los test y quiz están en ingles por lo que si alguien no domina bin el idioma no podemos calificarnos ,una verdadera lastima , compre el certificado y no podré hacer el curso .
I want to change my course and also want to change my mail id .
Didn't find the course interesting
I enjoyed Steve's teaching style and his level of knowledge. I gave it 3 stars because it did not have objectives for each lesson and therefore I didn't know what the expectation of my understanding should be.
It is slightly unscientific in its political correctness, not tackling head on the psychology of groups and the debunking of feel good concepts like multiple inteligences. However, the lecturer is very good summarizing even though he chastises himself as too talkative. He's not. Moreover he knows his subject very well. I highly recommend this course.
Nice lector, good information (there are a few mistakes), ugly designed. Guys, it's XXI outdoors, why you choose this poor presentation and micro screen for lector instead of any average MOOC' design on Coursera?
The course is very basic and doesn't deal much with clinical psychology.
Not well presented lessons too long in most cases
The content is great. But I think we need quizzes every week plus midterm exam and final exam. It will help consolidating our learning. Putting all things about 50 questions in a midterm exam and final exam? That just won't work!
Does give you a fine overview of basics in psychology. Would have appreciated more quizzes and less soapboxing during the lecture videos.
Good course, and the topics covered during the course sessions were very much enlightening.
To get more information in detailk
I loved this course, mainly due to our wonderful Professor. He focused on very pertinent subjects in Psychology (I felt like we covered the highlights of a whole year worth of subjects in 10 weeks) AND he did it in a very engaging and fun way. In a nutshell, he is AWESOME!What I did not like, which is also why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is mainly due to organisational matters: 1) the course schedule does not follow the weeks as listed in Coursera which creates TOTAL confusion, and it can be very easily solved. At the very least, the mid-term and final exams should be placed after the correct weekly schedule. Right now it is shifted by a week (earlier)2) The instructions about the peer assignments were not fully clear. I think also there, this is a quick fix and quick win. Simply adjusting the wording to better explain the process would help reduce questions on the forum. 3) There was almost no staff involvement in the forum. The responses were very far in between, which also made the forum discussions not as lively or exciting. I would have loved having the professor himself on the forum, or at least one of his assistants in the forum, sparking discussions, responding to threads etc. This was almost on existent. So in short, I would highly recommend the course due to its content! But I also feel that there are organisational improvements, which if made, would make this course a true 5 star course!
This was an excellent course! I have learned very much from this course, and many things which are applicable to everyday situations. The professor was very scientific, and I found none of the facts he chose to represent be swayed by his personal biases. Now, the only reason I choose to give this course a four star instead of five is due to some of the content inside the lectures. I was flashed a few times by almost nude women, and this caused me to need to scroll out of the view of the lecture multiple times. It annoyed me somewhat that these pictures were shown in something which was supposed to be solely educational. But, this is my only complaint about this course. Otherwise, this was a very informative course.
This was my first earnest attempt to learn theory behind why be behave who we behave. I am usually very interested in people, animals and cultures used to correlate what I observed and made my own analysis and interpretation.  Last, 8 weeks of structured learning guided by Steve Joordens helped bring all of of it together and answered many of my questions that I never asked anyone! He has tried and I think, has succeeded to provide a good introduction to guide learners like me to our next stage of learning, which for me personally will be know more about Cognitive Science and application in Education. I enjoyed learning!
The course material is interesting and easily understandable. Also, the professor is really engaging, and I loved the lectures. (P.S. He has a really dry sense of humour!). The tests are comprehensive and cover both memory and application of the concepts explained in the lectures. Also, the extra reading and video material is really cool!The peer-review assignment could have been handled a little better, I'm not sure everyone (including me) clearly understood the grading criteria while submitting and during the peer-review phase.All in all, definitely a course I recommend for a basic look into Psychology! :)
I liked this course. The lectures are really interesting and informative. I had no experience about psychology field before, but I had no problem during the course. Also, Professor Steve Joordens is a really good and experienced instructor. He has taught the lectures very well and tried to make them fun and interesting for us. I feel happy and grateful that I learned many valuable information. I definitely recommend it everyone who is interested in psychology. It gave me a good perspective and experience. I would like to thank professor Steve Joordens at first, and then my course friends !
4 stars because it was an engaging overview of a potentially huge volume of content, a reasonably meaningful assessment (Quizzes and assignment) and presented by an enthusiastic prof. (Thanks Steve).  5 stars if it was somehow more concerted.  I know its a 101 course, but i think establishing an enduring theme through the course might improve access to some meaningful context for the student to hang its concepts.  Also, a more focused review of the most influential psychologists (with timeline) would be a valuable addition.
I absolutely loved this course. It really is a great and thorough introduction to the fundamentals of Psychology and Psychological theory. Towards the end of the course, the lectures felt a bit material-heavy and rushed, in that there wasn't enough time anymore to cover it all so maybe it would be good to extend the course period. But aside from that, everything was great. Steve is a wonderful professor and his lectures were interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend this course to others.
I really enjoyed this course. Professor Joordens is super knowledgeable and his interest in the subject is evident. The extra videos and resources were an added bonus. Some of the links were no longer working (copyright reasons, etc.), and I may be incorrect about this, but a couple questions on the final seemed to be about material that hadn't been covered (about parenting, I think?). Overall, great course, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to explore the subject.
I enjoyed everything about this course. The lectures were snappy, engaging and informative. The topics moved quickly, but not so much that it skimmed. The resources don't always work (because the links are external) and the exams are misaligned, with questions on the Week 6 exam based on lectures from Week 7. This is a problem, and will reduce people's grades for sure, but this doesn't sway me from recommending this course.
It gave me a good overall foundation for future psychology courses and the content was interesting and properly-leveled. The only downsides were some outdated supplementary materials, a wonky interface for the final paper submission, and a plethora of unprofessional typos/misspellings (e.g. "agression" or "predjudice" or even the final exam had a misspelling in one of the answers "confindence" or something like that).
This course is an excellent choice for anyone seeking to gain an introduction to Psychology, The course is delivered with an emphasis on understanding and allows you to take in each topic ranging from Neurology to Mental Illness. I will highly recommend this course in the future. Professor Joordens is  excellent and does what it takes in his online video lectures so as you will take information and learn from it.
Never thought I could enjoy so much 12 weeks on psychology! Thanks to Steeve Joordens it was really easy to understand the various topics. I've learned so much and it gave me the hint to know more and to use this knowledge in my professional field. I have now enrolled for positive psychology course, and this introduction gave me a good base to keep on going further.... Thanks so much!
Thoroughly enjoyed the teaching style of this instructor. Would have preferred to continue future educating  with the same instructor.  The courses do account for time out of the education system. Ppl can also sign on at their convenience and the deadline reminders were a life saver. I have already signed up to continue moving forward, keeping an active brain and learning. Thrilled!
Last YearI received this course with Steve.I took the course for free and was very happy to do it again this year.I was a few points averaged under 70 but started right off the start on the Quiz with 45%.I stuck to the course for close to the year and wasn't too worried about my certificates! I’m looking forward for this years . Happy New Year’s course.gilbert
Fascinating topic and most of the classes were relevant, covering a large array of questions from the structure of the brain, to the explanation of childhood trauma. But having a very synthetic turn of mind, I would have liked to get shorter lessons, straight to the point (even if the teacher's style was really enjoyable and relaxing). Thank you teacher!
The lectures were engaging and relevant. I also appreciating the introduction to a multitude of theories and experiments. My only frustration was the lack of effort put in by classmates where the peer reviewed assignment was concerned. Many wrote nonsensical phrases such as "abcdef" and I felt that the peer review grading was lacking critical thought.
I really enjoyed this course - the professor was really animated and you could tell he really enjoyed teaching his subject. However, I wish there was more exploration of each topic. The prof. does give a whole host of resources at the end of each lecture with which one can explore however i feel as if the lecture was slightly time constrained.
Great course to get a rough delineation of the main concepts of psychology. The tutor is a good teacher, he's funny, knows his content well, and most importantly can bring it over in a simple but deep enough way (with clean powerpoint slides and meaningful extra material). Kudos to you Steve! Thank you very much to whoever worked on this. :)
The material is very easy to grasp for beginners. Moreover, the instructor presents in a way that always makes you curious and interested to learn more and, best of all, makes the presentation itself fun.The only problem is with the exams, which occasionally ask you questions on material not yet covered.
Very friendly approach & easy way of teaching made me more positive. Some PPTs were dark so that i couldn't focus well on letters but all other aspects were nice. Especially my Prof. Steve Joordans was very friendly. i miss his lecture a lot. Overall it was a wonderful experience. Thanks a lot.
A great starting point for whom need to learn about Psychology. but i think it will be better if video lectures contain more illustration and written items and short videos showing the experiments discussed in the lecture.Thank you for giving me such a great opportunity to learn more.Love you.
I find the course GREAT! A Game -changer, Relevant and Research-based, Engaging and Enriching, Awesome Professor and Thought-provoking lectures and discussionsGREAT! Thank you very much Professor Steeve Joordens, to Coursera and to our peers for this learning opportunity.
I found the course pretty engaging. I enjoy studying it and also feel encouraged to do some further study. However, the topics that are taught are not very holistic to me compared to some other basic psychology courses. Anyway, it's still a nice course to take :)
While registering for this course, I made a payment from the VISA Card with my wife's visa card. The name on it is Ibironke M Oguntuase.  Surprisingly , I cant find my certificate at the end of the course. Kindly check and do the needful urgently.
Course itself was perfect, materials were taught in a great way, both enriching and understandable.My only concerns are the practices and exams. It would be better if more practice questions were provided and exam answers were given to students.
I really enjoyed it, I learned a lot and it helped put into word the concepts I could only think about in my head and not translate. Really opened my eyes more to understand the world around me. I just wish the course had even more topics!
Great course! I enjoyed every second of it.  I think there some topic which can be a bit clearer. But the most improtant feedback is that you need to give the ability after a test to see what was the correct answer with an explaination.
Just enough information to be enough - doesn't go too much in depth, but not completely on the surface either.  Gives good examples. Always has additional resources for more information.  Professor has good sense of humor.  Canadian!
Realy enjoyed the course dynamics.I did audit this course but i did get a good feel of it. I do understand there is another course with the professer on feb.5.I would to do this course again and see if I can get a good feel of it.
its good but i need something more advanced , more questions and answers , more articles , more videos.and also it needs Arabic subtitles .but i am so grateful to the work you have done to spread something valuable like this
This course is actually quite helpful even if you've no prior knowledge about psychology. If you know a bit of it like me, then it's really good to brush up your basics and fill yourself up with trivia and fun facts!
I enjoyed the lessons with Steve Joordens, I could relate to his sense of humour. I could tell he wanted to share more but there was a time limitation. Some of the links were broken though. Please update these
It is a good overview and introduction to psychology. Unfortunately the course has some outdated links and resources. With a slight update in some videos and sources, this course would be perfect.
it was quite an interesting course, the instructor was entertaining yet delivered the course intensively. i had a good time even though i felt some lectures could have been shorter. kudos!
Professor Joordens explain every topic with an inspiring passion. The examples he brings are interisting. I'm not giving 5 stars because this course could use a few update on some topics.
I continue to enjoy Psychology Dr. Joirdens is one awesome and cool prifessir. I niw have a better understanding functioning in that 3 lb wrinkled mass sitting inside the cranium vault.
At the beginning it was kind of hard cause there was a lot of history and concepts; but as moves forward it gets more and more interesting. I end up switched with spychology!
Great course, very interesting material, excellent presentation by the professor. One thing I would improve are exams & assignments - they could have been more challenging.
It is very informative and a great platform to learn about psychology and a very good way to realise and know how interested we are to follow this subject even furthur.
Some of the videos were extremely long. Its possible we lost interest midway those lectrues. However the course was extremely educated and highly positive
Excellent course, I really did learn a lot and in a very efficient manner. I wish I could meet Prof Joordens in a real class (meaning not an online one!).
I really enjoyed the course. Information were new and interesting, and Prof. Joordens has great teaching skills and a friendly attitude. Thank you.
It is such an awesome course.I have learned a lot about Psychology through this course which will  help me in my life and career.Thanks a lot .
Es muy interesante y de gran aprendizaje, lo mejor es que puedo aprender a mi ritmo en donde sea y a la hora que sea, super recomendado
The content is great but the links are outdated.The midterm was scheduled at the end of week 4 but it covered content taught in week 5.
the course was very enjoyable and I learnt a lot. The coursera app for iOS was diabolical before the update and only so-so afterwards,
Extremely well elaborated Course. Definitely fueled my interest for the subject. Professor was interactive and indeed spectacular.
I took this course with great pleasure. The professor explains well and is also pleasant to listen to and watch.
It is an excellent course. Perfect  explanation. Everyone who has interest must definitely pursue the course
Very engaging videos and animations, covered the field of psychology on a base level extremely effectively.
I have learnt so much by this course and I got psychological stats of a person can be known by this course
It's been interesting learning psychology. I got all I needed to know as I begin a career in psychology.
this is the first psychology course I've done and will probably be looking for more in the near future
The peer reviews should be reduced to 1 or 2 because it is taking a long time especially in 2019
It was a really interesting course, not too heavy going at all,  I feel much more informed now.
very good and in detailed introduction in psychology, provide me a guideline for uni course
The course itself is great, but a lot of the links they provide are dead.
Extremely engaging presentations (videos) with a passionate professor.
FACTS AND ROTE COULD HAVE EMPHASIZED ON PRACTICLE KNOWLEDGE ONLY
Good course overall, though some of the content was fragmented.
Very good course. Psychology a wonderful science, very useful
Grat course! Everything you need to know if you're a starter
Great course, really glad I got the chance to participate!
Content is good but length of each video is too long.
thank you for being our tourist guide prof.
I really loved the content of the course.
Lots of material with good presentation.
Very informative course.well explained!
this mooc is extremely helpful
Enjoying the course so far...
Insightful and fun
crisply defined
ENGAGING
Professor Steve Joordens is beyond awesome!! He made the Introduction to Psychology MOOC both interesting and fun.  I would highly recommend this course to everyone.  I give it a five-star rating!
The teacher was amazing! I was so entertained with the material we were taught throughout the few months! Definitely recommend this course so anyone with curiosity to why we do what we do!
Would take it again! :) This was one of the most interesting courses that I ever took in my entire lifetime and one of the rare few where I truly enjoyed sitting through each lecture, wanting to study more and learn more. Dr. Joordens has a very engaging style and breaks down the concepts so beautifully! I have no background in psychology but after taking this course, I've started to take more courses in psychology although my professional experience is in a completely different field. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the workings of the mind and human behavior. I even re-visit some of the lessons sometimes! Great course and totally worth the time and effort!
I loved every minute of this course! Professor Joordens was very engaging and it was set at just the right pace. I'm  looking forward to my next course already! The discussion forums are very helpful.
I can't believe I'm finishing this course! I have to admit it was an amazing journey. This is a comprehensive introduction to psychology that covers lots of topics generally but gives you the tools and motivation for further analysis.When I started I thought psychology was just about why we do things, and I couldn't have been more wrong. This course has opened my eyes, now I understand lots of day to day situations and I'm  eager to keep learning. You'll explore lots of interesting experiments that exemplify different situations and helps you understand how experimentation works in the field these days and throughout history.Don't expect to be able to analize people and completely analize yourself. This course lets you grasp the concepts and enables you to think through in these situations. Developing, in this way, you critical thinking skills. Now it's up to you to decide wether to keep up with these remarkable lectures.Thanks Professor Joordens for this amazing time.Best regards,Sebastián, from Argentina
Thoroughly enjoyed the course. Always wanted to understand a bit of psychology and this was a wonderful opportunity. Thankyou Coursera and Mr Steve Joordens for this enjoyable learning experience.
Dr. Steve creates a fun learning environment and is very relatable in his delivery. His approach to an online modality is very natural and engaging. I highly enjoyed the material and the approach.
The course was great and enhanced my knowledge on various topics. Especially the bystander effect , I was able to relate that in my country India, there have been many cases where nobody helped the victim and just stood around him/her down the road.Moreover, now I know how my  brain works. How conditioning takes place , how sleep affects our lives.Last but not the least, I would suggest this course to anyone who is curious.If you are curious this 12 week course is for you , it is not like any other psychology 101 course, it contains a lot of information which would be a great digest if ingested.
As a retired senior I have always wanted to take a Psychology course.  I am glad this was the course I chose.  The professor was great at explaining some very complicated concepts!
good course. suitable for starters. I learnt some basics and something interesting. I now can analyse some social events from the psychology point of view. I understand humanity a little bit better.
THE professor is excellent: charismatic, knows how to explain and put in context concepts, very professional, very articulate, high emotional individual, makes you love PSYCHOLOGY - he is the star. On the other hand the infrastructure lacks many things: a video on HOW TO SUBMIT, EVALUATE the assignement - many questions coming back on FORUMS - and all these would be solved by doing an explicit video about HOW TO  - all this should be integrated in week 1 ORIENTATION TO THE COURSE. Second posting a DIPLOMA/CERTIFICATE photo as example - would answer many questions on forums, pls also post this in THE WEEK 1 - ORIENTATION. Third, problems in QUIZ, the first and last quiz are asking questions about info that are NOT COVERED in the weeks the professor is explaining (ex. quiz 1 SHOULD cover the information covered between week 2-week 4, but it has questions about week  5 videos - this I found NOT acceptable). I saw and read many complaints on FORUMS about this - from my side I already repported to accesibility@courserahelp.zendesk.com.  Last but not least, the support from COURSERA was always quick and very professionnal, and I hope that all my ideas after readng and facing some problems will be solved very very soon. Thank you for this amazing course, thank you professor and I hope I will be a real student in Toronto soon when I will come back in Canada. THANK YOU and pls send my gratification to professor S. JOORDENS he deserves it.
The course is well structured, informative and updated. I enjoy all sections of the course as well as the humor of Prof (especially all lessons in the second haft of the course are brilliant). The extra topics of Week 11 & 12  are very useful. I found myself better learning from self reading, so the further video & reading articles are helpful to me. I usually, take further step to explore the related videos or articles. Unfortunately, some of the videos are not available (obviously, not anyone's fault) and some links was wrongly linked to other sites. Sometimes the links in ppt are wrong, sometimes the links in the flatform go wrongly. I understand that 30 minutes are not enough to cover each topics, so I will prefer to have other courses which provide a deeper investigation in each topics (or some keys topics) . It will be greater if these courses were linked to each others or recommended to learned who completed one of them. Last but not least, thank you very much for your informative course, especially to Prof. Steve for such a great job. Please keep up with your work. Best regard, Sunny
I loved the course it was so informative and fun at the same time. I definitely learned a lot and it helped me in my journey of career shifting.
Enjoyed all classes and learned a lot of things about our mysterious mind.
Having taken many courses online I found this one extremely high on coverage, quality of content and dedication of the faculty. The ""side-dish" and additional content showed Just how much of a natural teacher professor Joordens is. Having working in training delivery I have seen the effect on delivery of the dedicated and instinctive nature of the trainer.  The fact that Professor Joordens wears his expertise lightly, unlike most people who I have seen deliver talks and sometime when the said "expertise" merely involves a week of research to write an article for a newspaper, is really potent quality. My greatest respects are for people like you who further my strongly held value that all knowledge is a shared asset for us and not a resource to be restricted, exploited or traded. For someone who does not engage in social media I hope this message conveys my deepest regards for people involved in bringing to fruition this excellent course. Thank you.
It is the best course I have ever done in my life including my graduation subjects, post graduation subjects. it's simply awesome the way it has been taught, It has always been interesting never too long and boring at any point of time. he additional video, the informal conversation, the special connect Steve Sir made with us.(me), just amazing!! It has not taught psychology in a way- I would ever thing of teaching anyone anything. One slight thing that I found- would be useful is brief summary of the whole lecture. key points. (though it is something- I would like to do at my own, afterall there has to be some effort and contribution from student. My final words is a great Thank you and a hug to steve Sir, and thanks to Coursera. Superb!
太棒了！作为英语不是母语的高龄学生（42岁），边工作边艰难地学习着，虽然很累，但是收获了很多。首先我从一个心理学的门外汉变成了入门者，而且老师精彩的授课与丰富的课程内容使我对心理学产生了更加浓厚的兴趣，未来会继续在这一学科学习与深造。其次，通过将10个月的学习，是的，因为英语不是母语，我每次课前都要写下载字幕文件进行预习，听完课后还要复习，才能消化课程内容，所以我学了将近10个月！不但成了心理学入门者，我的英语水平（起码是相关的专业英语）有了巨大提高。所以，我非常感谢这门课，非常感谢授课老师。希望有机会还可以听到您的其他课。
Love the course and the way our techer let us know the concepts. Thank you.
Very Interesting course, fine material, leading to the next level...
Can you remember the feeling of the last class of your favourite course teacher? I got the same somberness in the last lecture of this course. In my MOOC journey, I'm feeling lucky where I've got the chance to complete Steve Joordens's phycology course. He is so brilliant, natural (obviously doesn't just read-out from slides like most of the MOOC teachers), and has a whimsical sense of humour. I've come to know a lot of theories, explanation and experiments. It's hard to state all the topics of 12 weeks course of almost 20h. I know it's a long course but I can assure you that it will give you a huge mind-blowing experience which you should take part in. N.B. I always feel cheerful after finishing any MOOC courses, but this one takes me to another level!
Decided to start on this course because I have always been interested to study about human behaviours and topics related to mental illness and etc. I really love how Professor Steve explains things in detail, makes the lessons fun using his jokes, gives fun examples and makes the lessons engaging. Professor Steve isn't like those people who teach for the sake of teaching and really wants to give us some of his knowledge. After taking this course, I have learnt so much about the different kind of topics in Psychology and it is so interesting and eye opening! Would definitely recommend this course to my friends. Thank you so much for this Professor Steve, would definitely take another course with you again!
Steve was a great instructor and made the class easy to follow. I highly enjoyed learning all of these topics on psychology and the history behind certain concepts and practices. My only complaint is that sometimes the links at the end of the videos were mixed up and some of the last questions on both exams I think we didn't learn about at all I believe. Overall this is a great course for anyone who would like to get a better grasp on psychology and learn a little about some of the many areas there are in this incredible field. Thank you Steve and the University of Toronto for making this possible and introducing so many people to psychology.
Thank you for this course! it has been one of the most satisfying and rewarding experiences I've had. It has been extremely thrilling to be Professor Joordens' student. He not only made it super easy to understand complex psychological concepts, but also made it fun and interesting. Please keep up the good work and don't stop teaching! You were born to be an educator. Thank you Coursera and the University of Toronto, it's incredible what you do for education, and it's amazing to think that you can reach people everywhere in the world. Here in Panama you'll have an always-thankful student ready to learn more! <3
Simply amazing, learnt a lot!  The course contents, the teaching, the extra material, the grading process were all wonderfully executed. I got to understand the vastness of psychology inspite of it being a young science and absorbed flavors of clinical, behavioral, social dimensions of psychology. Personally, I found that the Freudian approach gave a wonderful perspective on the conflicts in the mind. For people interested in this subject, this course is a wonderful introduction. Go for it! I am now looking for the next step after this course :) . Any connecting course on offer from Steve Joordens? :)
Encantada de participar de un curso tan interesante, ha superado mis expectativas, temas cautivadores y bien explicados, sin lugar a dudas el profesor Steve Joordens es un maravilloso mentor, su acompañamiento e información anexa para seguir investigando deja el deseo inmenso de seguir aprendiendo cada día mas.Gracias por su dedicación y esmero en cada clase , aconsejable totalmente a todas las personas que deseen seguir preparándose para un mejor futuro.Continuare con ustedes, quiero seguir aprendiendo, muchas gracias ....... Un cariñoso saludo desde Colombia....
A very well done online course. The material flows nicely, easy to understand without a strong need for memorisation. Prof. Joordens presented the material in a very engaging manner. I looked forward to "go to class", to learn something new.The assignment is my first peer assignment. It was quite scary in the beginning but it was very satisfying upon completing it.Prof. Joordens please continue to make new online courses. Thank you very much for all your hard work, for the knowledge, and for the fun. Thank you Coursera for bringing in such high quality course.
Never have I ever willingly sat and followed course material for hours at a stretch. Professor Steve Joordens has an amazing way of teaching that is easy for beginners to understand and engages active learning. The course materials are concise and easy to follow; the external video and reading links are helpful at giving a well-rounded understanding of topics. I also want to highlight the Coursera learner support team who have been so incredibly supportive and prompt to help me throughout this course. Thank you all, I really enjoyed following this course!
This course was fantastic! Prof Joordens is extremely engaging and an excellent teacher. The entire course is perfectly set up for adult learning. The lectures are concise and stick to 1 topic per video. The topics are well organized and flow easily. And I really appreciated being able to download the power point, lecture video and scripts. Prof Joordens really captures your attention and gives you all the resources to delve deeply into numerous introductory psychological concepts. I'm thrilled to have completed this course! Thank you Prof Joordens
This course is really good and complete to understand what Psychology is about. Prof. Joordens covers psychology from biological to therapeutical aspects that will not only help you understand a topic of knowledge but actually understand your own behavior. The focus of this course is scientific so you'll get a sense not only of your brain but also of resources that can help you learn more after you finish the course. It's one of the course I'd recommend to everyone but especially to those who are considering it as a potential career.
Phenomenal! Absolutely loved it. Prof. Steve's expertise in the subject and his enthusiasm to teach comes through every course lecture. I think I'll enroll into any course Prof. Steve teaches. This is the first MOOC I've completed and judiciously studied for. I took notes, made mind maps, poured through all the additional resource because everything was so fascinating and I wanted to learn more. (Scoring well in the exams was just a lovely bonus.) Thank you for offering this educational, makes-you-think-about-thinking course.
Me ha parecido un curso de introducción a la psicología muy completo, y el profesor Joordens tiene una gran habilidad para comunicar y explicar el temario de forma que atraiga al espectador y se entienda todo perfectamente. El único "pero" que pongo al curso es que no haya opción de realizar los exámenes en español porque las lecciones las escuchas en español y te aprendes la terminología en ese idioma pero luego los exámenes hay que hacerlos en inglés y puede que muchos términos o referencias no las entiendas por el idioma.
Great choice if you're looking for an easy, fun introduction to exploring the brain.Really wonderful! Professor Steve Joordens is engaging and funny, and is honestly so excited about his subject that you invariably are too. The lectures are easy to grasp and provide a solid base for further learning. The course has a midterm, final, and project- none of which are too challenging. While I won't call this course amazingly informative, it does what it claims to- introduce you to psychology in a thorough and engaging manner.
An excellent course and definitely succeeds in what it does; introducing the field of Psychology to anyone interested, assuming no previous knowledge. Professor Joordens explains stuff very well in such a way that it is easy to grasp and even for more difficult and tricky concepts, follow-up resources are provided to fill any gaps and to reinforce what is learned. It was a great ride, full of fascinating topics and I've definitely gained much knowledge from it! Thank you so much for this course Professor Joordens!
This course is incredible. I just love professor Steve Joordens. His has pure excellence in teaching. The way he explain things in detail is on top. For a person who has zero knowledge in psychology, can easily adapt to his teaching method and easily learn about psychology. Well done to all the team. Keep up with more good stuff. Am really looking forward for further courses by professor Steve Joordens. May God Blesses him and entire team of introduction to psychology by University of Toronto!
You can really see that professor Steve Joorderns has a passion for teaching and it shows in every single class video of this course, every time you finish a video it leaves you hungry to learn more, and curious to keep searching about each topic you see, you can say that he transfers a bit of the passion that he feels for psychology. I can't recommend more this course with Steve, if you are already interested in Psychology you will fell in love with it again and again during this course.
I loved this course!  Prof Steve Joordan's was EXCELLENT!!  As an ex-pat Canadian, I loved the Cdn accent and references!  In all seriousness, this course has been a wonderful introduction to psychology with a rich exposure to many concepts within the discipline.  I took the course as a tester to see if pursuing a career in psychology might be on the cards for me.  After taking the course, I feel confident that the Psychology pathway will be the right next step in my career progression.
I am glad to have completed this course. It has not only introduced me to the world of psychology but has given me a new dimension to see the world itself. It has opened up the doors of my thinking capacity and abilities. It has been a real joy to attend the videos of Professor Steve Joorden and would request him to bring up more advanced course than this one and lead the interested students to completing their post graduation (Masters degree) in it. Thank you so much Steve sir.
I started this course without having any knowledge about Psychology, but the professor was very talented and intelligent, he has the way to explain difficult things (such as brain system) in a very good way and I can understand this quite well. After I finished the course, I can understand my life and peoples mind better and I have more confidence to take another Psychology class in advance. I have a good feeling every time I attend the class. Thank you very much.
It was a really good course. Into a relatively short span of time the course instructor managed to put a lot of interesting subjects. I would even take psychology II if I could. And for me it's very important that this course was interesting, so even if the lectures went over 10-15 minutes, they never seemed to be slow. I definitely would like to see more courses like this on the subject of psychology. And thank you for anyone and everyone involved with it.
This is one great course. I would recommend it 100%. You needn't necessarily take this course for a professional benefit, the syllabus is coherent and thorough, easy, and interesting. You never feel the burden of learning at any point. Professor Steve is amazing and so cool. He is extremely knowledgeable and at the same time, funny. Follow up properly on the topics and do every extra reading the professor suggests,...you would not regret taking this one.
Really great course to start the journey into the world of psychology. Professor provides clear information in an interesting and engaging form. Plus, in contrast to some other courses with 4 or 5 weeks of few lectures, here you get 8 weeks with 7-9 lectures in each. I really enjoyed it! And will definitely wait for the next one, in order to go along with the course and purchase a certificate (I found out about this course too late to finish it in time).
An amazing and enjoyable course by Prof. Joordens. In my opinion, his ability to tell incredible stories while teaching new concepts was the best feature of the course. I also liked his authentic personality and his unbiased way of talking about any psychological and social concept. In summary, the course covers a wide range of psychological ideas and they're well complemented by the extra material given at the end of each lecture. Utterly recommended!
Thank you for the great experience. The course provides an excellent survey of the psychology discipline. I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures, quizzes, and written assignment. The written assignment made the course "real". I had to understand the concept and apply it to the world around me. It provided a good taste of university course.
La forma didáctica y la manera evolutiva que fue dado el curso hizo sencillo el comprender el origen de la psicología.  Como el factor emocional, las relaciones afectivas, el entorno pueden influir en el bienestar mental de una persona a tal punto de hacer que sea psicológicamente inestable. Las enfermedades mentales y desordenes del comportamiento son enfermedades silenciosas que si no son detectadas a tiempo pueden llegar a ser un peligro, no sólo para el individuo sino para todos aquel que están a su alrededor.  Gracias a la psicología se puede ayudar a que estas personas pueden llevar una vida más estable.
Prof. Steve is one of the best instructors I have ever come across. He takes an enormous amount of effort to help us understand the topics. He really wants us to learn as best as we can. It was a sheer privilege to have been under his tutelage during this online course. Thank you very much, professor. The course content is also adequate. I learned a lot of things I'd never have got to know on my own. One topic of my personal interest which was not covered was 'psychology and the workplace'. Anyway, I'm very happy I enrolled and completed this course!
Excellent Course. Prof Joordens has an amazingly engaging personality and he keeps the lectures fun and personal. I have never met him and at the end when he was saying good-byes I felt as if I am really saying good bye to someone I know in real life. The course content is extremely well structured, extensive amount of external extra information/ readings is provided and and he provides a lot of examples to explain the psychology concepts.Overall FANTASTIC COURSE. Cant wait for more courses from this team
I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Prof. Steve Joordens' style of teaching is very captivating.  He makes the process of learning, a kind of fun activity. He helps the learners to understand the concepts, with the examples, which are easy to relate to. He also helps the learners to expand their horizon through excellent reference links. Thank you Prof. Steve. And, thank you Team Coursera, for providing such a wonderful learning experience through a wonderful teacher!
The course was very in depth and varied. Lots of topics were addressed, accompanied by plenty of material to view and/or read. I really liked the essay assignment of week 10, it really gave me the feeling I had to work hard and get out there and present my obtained knowledge. I didn't expect this from an online course, and to me this is a big plus! Also, great job by professor Joordens! Can you say "about" one more time with that Canadian accent? :-)
Professor Steve Joordens has been one of the most influential professors I have met until now. This course cemented my love for psychology and I could also look at the basic concepts of psychology with a unique perspective as professor helped me understand it better with relatable and relevant examples and events. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in psychology as by the end of it, you will surely love it.
This a fascinating course! This course one of the best online courses I've ever taken. Prof. Joordens is amazing, the way he presents and explains the topic really impressed me. The course is well structured, each lecture is supported by additional links to videos and readings.  I really enjoyed the course, every week i learned new things, got understanding why people behave in a certain way and found answers to many questions i had. Thank you!
I would really like to appreciate the effort of Professor Steve Joordens in making this MOOC , I have been a long time seeking a comprehensive introduction to psychology via books or internet but never had the big picture that this course has given me, from here I can dig deeper on selected concepts.Really  recommend it and thanks to Coursera, University of Toronto Scarborough and all the people participating in discussions and rating essays!
The professor or guide is one of the best teacher I have ever seen, he makes every this real easy to understand and the best part is that he not only teaches but shows you how the theory really works in the real life. It is evident that professor Steve Joordens is passionate about his teaching and is very knowledgeable. The quality of content and material in this course shows that prof has really worked hard for creating this lecture series.
This is my first ever course in Coursera and it was honestly a fascinating experience. Steve Joordens taught me so much, I hadn't even learned all this in my college. He explained some deep and dark points but somehow managed to make me smile in every lecture. I have been listening and seeing him for almost 9-10 weeks now and I already miss him! I really hope he comes up with more psychological courses. Thank you for everything sir.  :)
Prof Steve Joordens' course was really interestingly structured. Right from the history of psychology, to neuroscience, to some of the most radical experiments...it kept my interest going. Steve was also easy going and not pedantic. He had a sense of humour. I loved the course and recommended it to others who have taken it too. In fact, because of this course I have gone ahead and signed up with other psychology courses with Coursera.
In this course, psychology has been taught in a very lucid manner by Prof. Steve Joordens. I have enrolled for this course as am preparing for one of the toughest exams in India (UPSC CSE), and have opted Psychology as my optional subject. Prof. Joordens' style of teaching has simplified the subject topics and made it more interesting for students like us who have no formal academic background in Psychology. Thank you Sir.Best Wishes.
Steve Joordens is an amazing professor and offered much more than a standard, although comprehensive, curriculum.  The way in which he so intimately involved himself with the students was incredibly impressive and an effective teaching strategy in better engaging interest.  I enjoyed this MOOC so much I will be keeping an eye out for any public lectures Joordens may be giving in Toronto, where I live.  Without doubt, a 5 star course!
Extremely informative. The course is structured and well organised. Explanation is given in a simple language and is easy to understand. I did not know much about psychology but doing this course has increased my knowledge as well as confidence to learn more. The extra readings at the end of each lesson is very useful as well. Thank you so much for this course Professor Joordens. One of the best courses available on psychology.
Excelent course and exceptional teacher! The classes are very interesting and dynamic. I learned a lot of topics of psychology and how to apply them in daily life. Steve is clear at explaining complex concepts and gave lots of examples and experiments from around the world. This course gave me a better perspective of this area and make me aware of how can I make the difference and how can I help people. Totally recommended!
Amazing course.  These lectures are interesting, thought-provoking and informative.  Prof Joordens has an infectious love for this topic that really comes across in his lectures.  The balance of lecture to supplementary material is good, and most of the time if there is a broken link there are some good replacements in the forums.  Thank you Prof Joordens, University of Toronto and Coursera for making this course available!
Prof. Joordens, thank you so much for this course, it has changed my perspective and view of myself, others and the world. So much, that I was starting to ask myself:The way Prof. Joordens communicates these concepts throughout the course and makes it relatable is so inspiring and insightful. We should strive to educate ourselves and our children with a basic understanding of how our thoughts, emotions and behaviours work.
Loved it! Very interesting, covers a good spread of topics for those who have not completed any academic study in this field. The lecturer's genuine love for psychology is clear, and this can make all the difference. After spending a few miserable years in engineering and discovering a love for psychology in my spare time, this has been the final nail in the coffin to make an enormous change of life direction. Thank you!
Short (on the whole !) videos delivered with enthusiasm and insight by Prof Joordens. Very easy to listen to and he has a good ability to communicate complicated info to new learners. The pace of the course is good, I was motivated to keep going over a number of weeks and was very interested in the variety of topics that are covered. The 2 x tests are good for helping you understand and check your progress. Recommended.
this course is very interesting that i may try to find other options that involve psychology that actually might help me with other things that i might want to do in the future into a career that would be in the best interest for my financial needs and future enjoyment of the future that i plan to make in the next few years i thank you for this very enjoyable course and i am going to do more resource into this class.
It's a Fantastic course. I've never been so eager to learn something. And I already have 17 years of schooling. Have had a formal university education in 2 different countries and even attended some Master courses. I recommend this course to anyone, even if you're not interested in Psychology. Steve Joordens is an amazing Professor! I still can't believe technology can provide such high quality education for free.
Thoroughly enjoyed this broad introduction to the field of psychology. The professor does not merely read from a prepared script (as in many other of these online video classes), but speaks in an open natural way so it feels more like you are really in a college class listening to a lecture. I hope he decides to offer more classes via Coursera to explore some of the areas introduced in this MOOC in greater depth.
Excellent course, feels like a roller-coaster ride at times, great tutor, interesting topics, it helps if you have time and motivation to read a bit on extra on the various subjects because the format cannot give justice to the various topics, yet Steve did an amazing job in selecting good topics, explaining them well, and putting them in a perspective. I enjoyed myself tremendously and recommend this to anyone!
Prof Joordens really knows his stuff and has an amazing talent for explaining all sorts of different psychological concepts in a clear manner that's easy to understand. I can only wish all my university lecturers were like him! Even though the majority of the course was presented through simple Powerpoint slides, I found myself constantly engaged and fascinated by what he says. I think this speaks for itself!
If all courses are lead by such a talented lectured, I would me a walking genius. His enthusiasm is addictive. He definitely has not only knowledge but also a talent to share it. I always like the psychology, but now I know it can be so much pleasure to  study it. and i finally know all my brain parts! :)I encourage all that hesitate to skip the history part and go directly to further lectures - so worth it!
Professor Joordens was excellent and made the course very interesting by including many real life cases and papers and reference videos related to the topic mentioned in the slide. The quizzes helped to remember and recollect the information taught and the peer graded essay was engaging as well. Overall, a great introductory course for anyone who wants to venture into the interesting subject of psychology!
The most amazing Psychology course for beginners. I wanted to get an in-depth, professional look at the field as I'm planning on studying it in detail, and I got a lot more than a sneak peak, but an actual course with tons of really interesting and informative information, teached by a great professor that made me fall for the Study of the Mind. Each and every one of us should take on this course! Thanks!
Special hand folded thanks to  Prof Steve Joordens for  this opportunity  of experiencing such a wonderful  online course on psychology . Felt so connected to him throughout. Truly have gained so much knowledge from this course.  I would like to go for a formal certification too  as it would help me in future to take this learning forward in my career in this field Thanks againYogesh NaikGoa, India
This course and the content of the course was so educational and cool. I am really happy that I have completed the course. I am a student of Economics discipline and I really find the behavioral aspect of humans very intriguing and fascinating. I wanna thank our instructor Steve because he made the content very clear to me and for making the videos fun to learn. I wish him a happy and healthy life.
It was a very good course, we learned various amount of stuff on brain, psychology, etc, basically everything that its required if one wants to do future course on any type of psychology or if one wants to have knowledge on psychology in general. The lecturer made the course fun, had a good sense of humor and we didn't got bored and also everything was set very well and interesting and overall fun.
A wonderful introduction to the study of psychology, from an excellent lecturer.  Hoping everyone gains personally from the experience and shares their knowledge with family, friends and their community.  We are lucky to be part of this global learning platform. Eventually, there will be peace on earth and it comes from understanding and respecting others in society.  Keep positive and motivated.
I didn't expect this much of experience in this course, fabulous and Awesome . No words.As well "The Best teacher" who explains and give us more knowledge about the particular topics in 15 - 20 minutes. I hope who are interested in psychology should attend this class once from their study time.it would be amazing. “Excellent sessions! Provided very valuable information for my life and my career”
This is an ultimately comprehensive course for anybody who wants to get introduced to psychology and the basic scientific approach to psychological thoughts. It includes all the basic and important experiments and concepts to study. The best thing about this course is that it is taught by Dr Steve Jordeens who is a prolific professor in the department of psychology in the University of Toronto.
lucid presentation, beautiful examples, simple way of communication and expertise in teaching made this course great.Thanks to coursera as well for making this course possible and more importantly  reaching it to an ordinary person like me who is not a native english speaker living  a remote village in India.Thank you professor.Thank you Coursera.Look forword for next course from Prof Jordan.
I enjoyed doing this course. What made it interesting was that the videos were easy to understand and you could replay if you missed something. Thank You Professor Steve Joodens. Excellent job!! You made learning fun and easy and I just wanted to keep going. I did and was able to finish before the due date. Thank you COURSERA for the opportunity. I have already registered for my next course.
I was studying in Bachelors of Engg and my college gave us free subscriptions to the coursera to enroll for free courses and I found this one in the beginning, I thought it could be difficulty for me to get through this subject but the prof. Steve Jorden taught was really good and understandable, and though it was free for me but it was worth for paid ones too and recommended to my friends
Very interesting, good to follow - even for non-native speakers. I especially liked the many different examples and experiments that made it easy to understand the effects on our every day life. Of course, I am not an expert, but I feel that I got a good overview of psychology. So for me as an engineer, it was a very enlightening excursus into a new topic. Thank you, Prof. Steve Joordens!
Excellent introduction to Psychology. The narrative is very engaging. Enjoyed every lecture in this course.  It is structured so well and presented with excellent clarity that it makes extremely easy to assimilate the knowledge being imparted. The course content is highly recommended.  Gives you a good insight into the way our minds work and explains a lot of things that we see around us.
I absolutely loved every second of this course. Steve really has been a great tutor throughout the course, and really managed to kindle my interest in his field of work. The lectures are short and sweet and contain a lot more information than I would have even thought possible. I'd recomend this course to anyone who wants to learn a bit about what makes them think and act the way they do.
I really loved this course. It was extremely interesting, Professor Joordens presentation was lively and his enthusiasm was so contagious, it pulled me along even when I was tired and rushed. The course content was stimulating and challenging, providing a very complete introduction - a great place to start. I would love to follow more courses by him and his team. Many thanks indeed.
I've given this course five stars because I've conformed to the masses and was told to rate with five stars...Nah! Seriously though, I would recommend this course to anybody. It is brilliant and Steve Joordens explains things amazingly, the best way that somebody who is 6'3" tall can do! :)Fantastic course. Hope there's a follow-up/advanced course as I'd be more than interested.
Professor Joordens made this course an experience that enriched my days and my mind. Can't tell how much I've learned about the human mind and behaviour even not been graduated in related areas. His  way/method of explaining and his passion for Psychology made the difference and made this course an amazing experience. I'm excited for the next ones! Thanks professor Joordens!
The framework of the course is fantastic. I really appreciate the efforts put across for hand-picking the topics and sub-topics. Professor Steve is an excellent teacher and his virtual online classes felt no lesser than live classes. Thank you for creating this course and implementing it beautifully, which was easy to understand and connect with, even for starters like me.
I liked Prof.Joordan’s  representations and his friendly personality. In times of COVID-19, I looked forward to my daily “ sessions” with him. It’s a very intense course with many topics to cover but all of them are interesting. Wished the course would have Continued another 12 weeks...so,interesting and he presented it entertaining. Thank you for that an excellent course
It is a great course, with a great professor. The explanations are incredibly well given, the professor makes everything to us to understand his lessons, and gives links for more information, which are always valid and help us understand the issues with another vision, it isn't just the professor's opinions we get. I really loved this course! Cognitive Cannibal forever!!!
Exceptional. Jordan is a great teacher, really talented and incredibly didactic. He exemplifies really well every concept and the course is a useful Introduction to Psychology. Lectures are 20 mins long, so you need to be really passionate about psychology and learning because otherwise it will be boring for you. Commitment is required, it's not an easy course nor short.
Thank you, Dr Steve Joordens for a wonderful experience and the  warmth of your teaching. I did learn things and am hooked on learning more.  The course is well structured and doing the final assignment and reviewing peer assignments, was a great way to consolidate the learning. I hope you do "mount" another course or two in the future. I for one will be eager to enrol.
Professor Steve Joordens finds a way to teach psychology in a very interesting and captivating manner. This course covers a variety of concepts thoroughly considering there is a time limit for each topic. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about humans, social interactions, the science behind the brain and psychological experiments.
Fue un excelente curso, disfrute cada clase, los temas muy interesantes e importantes.Definitivamente siento que este conocimiento de psicología va a servirme mucho en mi campo laboral como maestra de secundaria, también siento que he abierto mi mente a una nueva perspectiva de como funciona nuestra mente, como controlarla y como entenderla.El instructor es el mjor.
This course kept (still keeping) my attention and interest, because the way it was given by Steve Jordan, very clear, scientific and very funny. He makes it easier to understand. It's a lot of information, but it triggers you to do your own research on the internet and books. I'm enjoying this course and it was never boring. Thank you for your teaching skill, Steve.
I really enjoyed the course has been entertaining and entertaining with many practical examples to understand the psychological concepts.
The course has given me more knowledge to practice in my life and work, because I work in human resources and the psychological perspective is very important.
Steve Joordens is a great teacher, he has made this course a great job.
It's a great course! I would highly recommend it to those who are interested in psychology but don't have any background. The curriculum itself is very well
designed. Professor Steve is inspirational and fun. I like his teaching style very much.  What I learned from the course is not just psychology theories and researches but also interesting practical knowledge.
Prof Joordens is extremely good at relaying concepts and making them stick. What's more, he's got a sense of humour, too! I loved everything about the course: the pace, the content, and the instructor. Thank you so much, Coursera, for making it available. Truly grateful to every single person involved in this, even the peers who reviewed the papers. Thank you.
What a great course I have ever found.....Thanks to the masterclass instructor who first builds your basics about functioning of brain and then taking you into the journey of psychology.....I am really fascinating from all those number of experiments that Prof has showed..One of my best decision ever make to take this course. Thumbs Up..............Guys .....!
Amazing!!This is my second time taking this course, it's loaded with information and it introduces all the branches of psychology really effectively. Prof. Steve Joordens is wonderful! he's so passionate about what he does, and no one can get bored from listening to his lectures.Thank you Prof.Steve and thank you coursera for giving us this great opportunity!
A thorough Psychology introduction, from backgrounds, to nowadays with stops in all key topics (Psychology main branches and fields, biological explanations related to Psychology, Social Psychology, memory, mental illness, etc.) explained by Prof. Steve Joordens with real passion, a truly great communicator, with a deep  knowledge of all topics in the course.
Immense powerful, the most powerful course i have taken so far in coursera. Thanks to Prof Steve for putting so much effort to put so much meaningful content in precise manner and articulate the same in this course. i strongly suggest anyone who is interested in the science of mind behavior or in general psychology should take up this course as a first step.
Wonderful course! Every opportunity to go above and beyond in this course is provided and encouraged through Professor Joordens' intriguing and inclusive teaching style. He is one of the most wonderful online teachers I have ever had, and really goes out of his way to make the course interesting and fun while still being down to earth and easy to understand.
An excellent course! A very useful and thorough introduction to the psychology field, I am left feeling inspired to learn more. Professor Steve Joordens is inspirational and fun to follow. Only criticism I have is that there were some administrative issues, for example the mid-term test covering topics of 5 weeks, while the test was set in week 4.
Steve is very knowledgeable and explained the course material well.  I thought his videos were great and liked that he added some personal touches (and mentioned Canada when he could, yay Canada!).  Very interesting subject...I'd like to look into more psychology courses.  Thank you for making this a wonderful experience!  I look forward to more.
This is a really helpful and interesting course. I learnt a lot about psychology and different concept. Thank you, Prof. Steven, for conducting the course and prepared for the course material. He is entertaining tho LOL I still remembered he put a recipe for relevance reference just because he mentioned it once. Highly recommend for the course.
Professor Steve Joorden's was a pleasure to have as our lecturer in this introduction to psychology. The course has introduced me to previously unfamiliar psychological concepts which has broadened my understanding of the mechanics of the human mind, and social psychology especially. Thank you Coursera and Prof. Joordens for this great course.
A good course. suitable for starters. I came from a non-psychology related background and I learnt some basics of psychology, how this area of studies came about and now I can analyse some social events from the psychology point of view. I can safely claimed that I understand humanity now, a little bit better than before I took up the course.
The course gives a good high level view of different aspects of psychology. Professor Steve truly infuses a positive energy into the entire experience. I do not have any formal psychology education. The course help me establish some fundamentals. I would surely recommend this course to the beginners. Hope to see an advanced level of the same.
lots of useful knowledge given in a fun and casual way. The lecturer Steve is good, funny and cool. And I love his lectures on kids development for parents as I am a parent of a toddler myself, and I agreed totally with what he said. This course helps you to be aware of the psychological aspect in everyday situations which is cool and usual.
Wonderful course, wonderful instructor. All the lectures are interesting, relevant, and explained very well. The outside resources (some i could not access because they had been taken down, or the links provided didn't work) were brilliant and very helpful as well. Prof. Joordens should now start a more advanced course on psychology as well.
This course kept me interested all the way. It was pleasurable to take it. I was hooked. I was moving from a lesson to the other wanting to know more and more. Now that it is over I feel empowered with knowledge, but I also feel I want more. I highly recommend it. Many Thanks to Steve Joordens who made it accessible and easy to understand.
I love this course ! The professor is very clear in what he is explaining and he makes it very interesting. I definitely learned a lot through this course, and hope to find other courses taught by Steve Joordens. I definitely recommend this course to any beginner in Psychology, or anyone hoping to brush up on some knowledge on the subject.
It was really a great informative course. i had great fun learning from prof steve. it certainly perceive world in a different way now thanks to this course. i  started this course just for fun purpose but it turned out to be really helpful so i decided to stick to the end.once again a big thanks to prof steve and coursera for this course.
I absolutely enjoyed taking this course! Professor Steve Joordens did an incredible job explaining the course material and providing additional reading materials to extend my knowledge thoroughly. I can see his teachings are coming so much by heart that i always find myself excited throughout the course for the next lecture. Thanks Steve.
It was my very 1st Coursera study and I was so much benefitted by the skills learnt by it. Professor Steve is an awesome person to deliver the lecture, his words kept me bounded to the course as a student and also helped me practice the skills in my daily life.Thanks a bunch to the team Coursera and My Professor Steve Joordans.Salima Aziz
An accessible, fun course, covering a wide range of topics in the field of Psychology. The content was taught in a very clear and professional, yet light-hearted manner (kudos to prof. Joordens!) I would recommend the course to beginner-to-intermediate level psychology-lovers who would like to deepen their knowledge and gain some insight.
This was such a comprehensive and compact Cporse encompassing the basics of Psychology. The lecturer, Steve Jorordens did a remarkable job in introducing and touching up on the most important topics and going through them in a very interesting and enjoyable way. The further references and the little life tips given were extremely useful.
Very good course, very comprehensive, well structured and documented, very useful knowledge and resources. It was a real pleasure to follow the course lesson by lesson. And this is mainly the merit of the wonderful professor who is not only knowledgeable but also very dedicated and funny! Thank you very much for this learning experience!
The concepts of psychology are well explained by Prof. Steve Joordens. very practical examples and easy to understand. I think this course should be taken by all individuals, despite their profession. This course has really changed the way I look at things in life and has generated a larger interest to explore more in psychology.
I loved the way sir used to teach...  In the beginning I thought psychology is very difficult  and thought the journey is gonna be tough... After subsequent lectures I started enjoying learning... All credit goes to sir for coming up with interesting topics and explaining every topic in a crisp and clear manner.  Hats off to sir
It was an amazing course, so much interesting to learn even from the smallest of the changes happening around. It was beautiful the way Prof. Steve Joordens taught, his usage of examples made things about psychology so easy to understand and relate to even for someone like me who is typically from engineering background. Cheers.
The course is excellent! The professor is great, the didactics are perfect and it allows a lot of learning! The courses available at Coursera always impress me!_____________O curso é excelente! O professor é ótimo, a didática é perfeita e possibilita muita aprendizagem! Os cursos disponíveis no Coursera sempre me impressionam!
The course was very interesting. The way Prof. explained the themes was great, he made everything easy and accessible, even for someone like me that did not have any confidence with the field of study. Furthermore, the whole course was very well-structured and allow me to be prepared and motivated for every new lesson. Thanks.
Loved this course.  I felt like I was in class with Dr. Joordens.  He is a great lecturer and relates things to real life.  I am teaching Psychology at the high school level, and this gave me so many new ideas and a great outline for how and what to teach.  I truly enjoyed being in the class.  Can't wait to take another one!
I would recommend this course to everyone who is interested in Psychology and doesn't know where to start. Very well put together. Got me excited throughout the end of last lecture, learned lot of cool concepts. Whats more to say other than huge thanks to Prof. Steve Joordens and all the people who made this MOOC possible !
Steve Joordens is a really likeable and engaging professor who presents the course material in a way that is easy to digest but doesn't feel rushed. Would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in psychology or thinking of exploring a career change and would like to have a base knowledge of its different fields.
I really enjoyed this course and particularly Steve's obvious enthusiasm for his subject matter. I appreciate the deadline extension since work has been so busy for me which pulled focus as well as the many additional reading and reference recommendations. Some of the links didn't work, but overall, the content was great.
This is probably, one of the best fundamental courses on Coursera. I think every student who is interested in psychology or areas relating to it must take this course. Prof. Joordens have mixed a proportionate amount of case studies and theoretical concepts to make the learning experience an informative and engaging one.
