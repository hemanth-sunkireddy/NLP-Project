Basic course but very well presented. I would have rated 4* but no ppt was available for download.
I liked the course and it is a good introduction to Digital Marketing; I would only add some practical cases to be solved by the students and rated by teachers to make the concepts easier to test and assimilate.
Good course, dynamic. Missing only the answers of the quiz for self reflection.
The course is extremely well structured and you can learn a lot. This course is perfect for beginners, but it's far from being superficial or basic. The content covered in this course is comprehensive and can give you a great start in the digital marketing world.
