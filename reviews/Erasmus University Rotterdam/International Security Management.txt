Although l have worked as an international security advisor for a number of years, I found the course extremely useful. The sections on OSINT and illicit trade were particularly valuable and this sparked a desire to find out more. I did feel that some of the interviews were a little unnecessary but equally, some reinforced the practical aspects so no real complaint. Overall the format was extremely helpful. Since we are currently in lockdown due to the pandemic, I was able to complete the scheduled 7-week course in 7days  :)
Content is very good, very informative, for the most part. Unfortunately many of the scholars, not all, some are very clear,  do not have English as their primary language of communication, so there are mistakes in use of words, which affects the clarity of the message. This is unfortunate as it really changes the meaning of the message and it's especially bad for non-English speaking students to get a poor and uncorrected translation. Thank you for the course, which content is eye-opening.
The content is good. However, there is some issue with the accent in Week 6, especially, and a few of the modules in other weeks. Due to accent problems, some of the important words have been inaudible. Please pay attention to this issue.
Subtitles should be an accurate transcript of what's actually being said. More exercises would have been nice.
An interesting view of the theoretical side in matter of safety and security .
I did enjoy this course and it amongst other things has inspired me to apply for an international security themed Master's degree in Europe. A few things I suggest- I would have liked to have had more methods of testing in order to fully feel like I had earned more confidence and knowledge, and some of your speakers were quite difficult to understand (I know that English is most of your second languages so I am not trying to be rude, just to say it was more difficult for me to engage with the content because I was struggling to understand the speakers). All-in-all, thankyou for the content. It has led me to further pursue my knowledge in this field.
I understand this is an overview but, in several sections the content was broad but so shallow it lost practical utility. I would have preferred a bit longer lessens with more depth even if that meant an overall less well rounded course.
Excellent course. However, the sound was too low in some of the videos. And accurate subtitles would have been helpful. The teachers were enthusiastic and I loved the interviews with field professionals.
A good informative course giving a comprehensive overview of International Security Management. Ideal for beginners in this subject area.
Some guests where very
hard to follow because of their [bad] English pronunciation.
The course is really good and covers the aspects necessary to guide security and risk advisors. Nevertheless, it needs coherence between the weeks. Some weeks have excercises, articles, even recommended books while others lack a lot of information and support material, especially the fourth week about serious organized crime. The sixth and seventh weeks are extremely complete and useful.
The course is very good overall, but sometimes it felt repetitive and I wished that they would go deeper into the analysis of concepts.
Interesting with very good topics in the security field. Would be more interactive if the subtitles were embeded in the actual video.
Insightful! It examines a wide cross sector of the security industry with focus on current and future challenges.
Lots of content, minimal opportunity to test knowledge attained.
Structured well and very informative sessions. Well done all.
This is a course I will definitely recommend for all level of persons interested in security management.
