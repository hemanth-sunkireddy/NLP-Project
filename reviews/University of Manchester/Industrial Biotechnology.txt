why you don't offered a certificate??
I was so disappointed in the end when I figure out that the course not include the certificate
Very little continuity between topics, even within the same week. There are different professors teaching each video module, and there is just massive variation in the knowledge required going into it, the slides, etc. It seems like professors were just asked to talk about their work for 10 minutes with little direction about the level of detail required and how it fits into the course overall. I am super interested in industrial biotech but this course was disappointing.
Great course, however you must offer a certificate
I'm a chemical engineer and I felt it is not to follow the course. Details are not explained as it is specified for a certain category of students. I'm interested in the field of bioprocess engineering but this course did not satisfy my expectations.
Certificate problems. The university logo does not fully load on the certifcate.
I completed my course but not getting certificate
I didn't receive my certificate yet
I didn't got my certificate.
No certificate!
No certification upgrade
This course was very helpful and provide lot of information
Pursue the course only if it is absolutely critical to your career. The professors have a high level of knowledge doubtlessly, but so many of them just ramble about, stutter continuously, have external disturbances in their audio, use lots of industrial lingo without explaining, or just plainly reading from the presentations. There is a lot of knowledge to be obtained from this course, but the teaching experience of all but a few professors (Week 3, Week 5) is not up to par with rest of the courses on this platform.
this course presents a difficulty to be followed in a closer way. I may have a good chemical description of the chemichal process, but as long as this description is not with the draung or picture it is hard to be understood.We need slides information to be printed along the explanation on the video. That is missing
Very good course .but after completing the course I am unable to download my certificate tried out in many ways but couldn't download my certificate .
Some lectures where very good and very well presented, Others where unfollowable and too hard for a 'Beginners' course
the first week was so of point but the other weeks are grate and the other star for not having a certificate :(
It could've been more interactive and the notes in the ppt's more short and sweet .
a very nice course for a beginner like me to start understanding the wonderful world of biotechnology in industry. I would like to improve in this course is to offer a certificate of achievement.
Usable as a very general overview, detailed insight lacking.
Highly useful. But I wish there was an explanation for terms
i really like the course and it was quite informative
This is my 2nd online course so I will be comparing with that.This felt more like lecturers were given to talk straight out of notes, didn't feel like natural. 1 week has only 1 tests with massive amount of info for only 12 questions. 2-3 normal test after a few modules in the middle of week would be better (this tests don't count in graded section but only to flesh out more question opportunity) (this was the structure in my earlier MOOC)
The course gives an good overview - the first weeks were not as good as the last part of the course. The presenting style (especially in the first weeks) is quite old fashion. Nevertheless I am happy that I attended this course.
Se hicieron un poco densos los módulos del medio, como que mucha fórmula química, ejemplos y no mucho más. Está bueno en sí el curso pero podría ser bastante más dinámico
I think the lecture slides had too much information at the same time. If only the respective line or figure can be shown one at a time, it might be better.Thank you
very informative & technical course...course material can be limited..& i did not get certificate after completing the course
Great opportunity to learn biotechnology ,it shifted my perspective on biology and chemical science.
Some parts are really boring and exhaustive. The narration in some videos is too fast.
Helpfull
The course presents a comprehensive overview of significant Industrial Biotech achievements and most promising areas of study. The creators put great emphasis on genetic engineering opportunities. However, in the real enzyme world, true non-GMO enzymes can be perfectly applied in many cases, specifically in the food sector with very high yields and selectivity. I would love to see more specifics on how some certain enzymes were developed, how some certain genes were picked with a further tune-up of the downstream process. Overall, I enjoyed the course a lot, specifically the part about next-generation biofuels and biopharmaceutical synthesis.
There are some pesky details which are relevant only for a very specific set of learners but nevertheless are part of the tests. On the other hand, the course, in general is well developed and well presented. The focus is on introducing the immense possibilities in the field while giving some technical knowledge to understand and appreciate the advancements in this field. Great course for a beginner. My advice to a general learner would be to not get bogged down if you get low scores in the tests and focus on long term learning gains.
A great course from wonderful professors. I am really thankful to them. The course is not completely for beginners. You need some preliminary knowledge of drugs designing, bioinformatics,tissue engineering to completely understand the course.  The details and prospects of biofuels , biopharmaceuticals ,biomaterials are really exciting!
Very informative and captivating course. I feel like my understanding of biotechnology is now at a point where I can pick up topics of interest to learn more at my leisure. I'd love to take another course like this.Most of the lecturers were great, except for the glycoscience Prof., who just read out long wordy slides.
Overall it's a great course to generally peek into Industrial Biotechnology. Since my major is biochemistry, this course is not difficult for me to catch up with. It's quite a good resource for academic researchers to broaden the horizons, especially in applications and real cases of their research.
this course is benificial for those who want to revised their acadamic syllabus in fast way this course includes some of main chapter of biotechnology engg,This short term course is very useful for those whose are unable to go out for internship in this pandemic.thanking you!
A great course for those who are to work in industries or become an entrepreneur.The course gave the basic and in depth knowledge on Enzymes, Synthetic Biology, Biochemistry and Bioprocess Engineering, Glycoscience and Biopharmaceuticals.
It is well stablish but I think that in some lessons the thematic is way too deepen, more that what it should, and in other is just too simple. I would reorganize better the course and work with more pedagogic slides.
I really loved this course, I gained more knowledge in terms of general industrial biotechnology. However, It would be tremendously helpful to put some examples of applied techniques in production of bio medicines.
The course content is very important and updated. it will be a great support in our career as well. thank you so much for attractive presentations.There are some issues related to the obtaining of the certificate.
Good overview of industrial biotechnology. I especially enjoyed the modules on bioprocessing, they were general enough to teach broadly applicable concepts. The later modules were a little too specific for me.
Please, note that the test to the 3rd week has lots of "X" marked at the end of some questions: the sames that are the correct showing the response before the students can even think about the questions.
The content was interesting and the breadth of knowledge shared was impressive as well. I think I would have enjoyed more in-depth video content on some of the topics, but overall it was a good course.
A comprehensive introduction to the world of industrial biotechnology. For the most part the course  is detailed enough to keep you interested. Gets a bit generic and repetitive towards the end though.
Several interesting topics are teached along the course, however the structure of the course seems to be  a little bit disorganized in some of the weeks. Also, the videos could be more appealing.
its been amazing to learn this course. I've gained a lot of knowledge on this subject. i would definitely  recommend to try out this course if one has interest in biotechnology. thank you.
It was really useful and thus, i could learn about this before my semester classes. It was very informative. But i was really disappointed because you didn't offer the certificate.
Curso muito bom, conteúdo relevante! Uma sugestão seria: trabalhar melhor na estrutura. Como são pessoas diferentes que ministram as palestras, alguns assuntos ficaram desconexos.
Interesting and engaging course although does not go as in depth as I had expected; would have liked to learn more and to look more into the biochemistry behind the technology
It was usefull. The course gave a very clear idea of the use of enzymes in industry, bioenergy, bio pharmaceuticals. thanks to all Professor who could take these lectures
I really enjoyed completing the industrial biotechnology course. Very informative course for me. I learned many important thing about industrial biotechnology. Thank you
Good overview of the topics for industrial Biotechnology. One more chapter for industrial production of glycoscience or tissue production would be benefical.
Very great initiative to aware students of knowledge from home itself...and helpful to add up in future opportunities..if provided with certificate.
Quizás demasiado básico en algunos aspectos, y por otro lado también ofrece demasiado ejemplos concretos...Lo mejor la cantidad de temas que abarca
it's an amazing course which highlights every essential part involved in industrial biotechnology while suggesting advancements for future.
If the course is more interactive, it will one of the best course for bio-technologist. But the course materials are at good standard.
Very interesting and complete course. However, this is from 4 years ago now and it would be nice to know how is it nowadays.
I have learnt a lot out of what I expected. Working in a pharmaceutical sector, week 3 and week 6 lessons are my favorite.
It is a great course for beginners to learn the different aspects of biotechnology, especially industrial biotechnology.
Very enjoyable and insightful course. I will be using this as a springboard in my future research projects.
Hello sir,it will be more better if you add more examples in the sessions. overall it is very good part .
Un curso básico que permite tener una mapa completo de lo que consiste la biotecnología industrial
This is a great introductory course into industrial biotechnology that made me want to learn more!
Gained a broad understanding of the biotechnology field (methods of production, formulation, ect)
the lectures about the structure of the medicines was a bit too much but over all quite good

I really enjoyed this course and although I am not a chemist nor a research biotech guy, I am a dentist that enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about industrial biotechnology.   Thanks so much!
Hi, i am taking this online course via coursera i would like to know if their is a certificate of recognition for the course?
Extraordinary MOOC. All speakers presented the most important current topics in industrial biotechnology. Very well documented and the expertise of all exposers quite evident. My current field is precisely biotechnology (production of rec proteins) and I really enjoyed this MOOC. I strongly recommend it. Congratulations to U. of Manchester.
Great course, but Why don't give certificate?. I am very interested in the doctorate (PhD) of Biotechnology at the University of Manchester.
Extremely interesting course. Also very attractive due to examples of biotechnology examples of real industrial applications.
This is a great course for beginners and provide very extensive knowledge on Industrial Biotechnology and the applications
It is outstanding course to get informed about advanced information. I really learn from this course. Thank you! Coursera
It would be better if there would be a certificate for it
This is a really fascinating course that sparked my enthusiasm for industrial biotechnology. Information incorporated encompasses a broad variety of basic sciences and advanced technology.
Awesome intro to modern technologies and production processes used in the Biotech Industry!  Does a great job of detailing where the industry is headed in the upcoming years.
Synthetic biology, industrial fermentation and green chemistry are integrated into the course and it is well organized and is a nice interdisciplinary course.Thanks.
The lectures were divided into modules that were appropriate in length/tie. Speakers were very easy to comprehend and the outline of the topics were well presented.
It was really wonderful course I really enjoyed the material and presentation of material and assessment.
PRETTY GOOD COURSE TO GET AN OVERALL IDEA ABOUT THIS FIELD
Muy bueno como repaso y actualizado.
A useful overview of modern biotech
it was pretty good. I learned a lot. Im from Dominican Republic and i didnt know how wonderful and widely is this area of industrial biotechnology. it makes me wanna know more about all of this
This was a very interesting course. It showcased a variety of techniques that are currently being applied in the field of biotechnology. This course provided a wide variety of industrial applications of biotechnology being applied in various sectors.
such a excellent platform, educators are so well they explained each and every concept in very simplified way.I am very happy to gain a lots of knowledge abot actual industrial biotechnology
Thanks to all professors of the Industrial Biotechnology course. The course syllabus was very well designed with every topic being taught in depth; which allowed me to learn a lot and enjoy each topic. My only complaint is that given the advanced level of the course there was not certificate available. I would like that in the future the University of Manchester offers in Coursera a specialization degree in Industrial Biotechnology and later a master and doctorate degree in the same field.
Besides, I would like that, given the depth experience of University of Manchester in this field, also offer courses in Molecular Tools for microorganism identification in soils and water and Microbial inoculant formulation for environmental and agriculture uses.
Thanks again for this wonderful course,

It really was a course that contributed a lot to me, I am a student of engineering in agro-industrial processes and complement my knowledge about: -The enzymes, how they work, how they are manufactured, their classification etc. -Synthetic biology which is an evolving field, designing a genome,production of useful molecules, the central dogma, directed metabolomics -Biochemical and bioprocess engineering, the subject of material balance was really captivating for me, I managed to understand the subject with the everyday examples it describes. I could go on to describe all the knowledge that this course offers, but in reality I can only recommend this course.                           THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
I think that this course actually requires moderately strong understanding of Organic Chemistry to understand certain sections, such as the fourth module on pharmaceutical processes. The case studies used in that module could certainly be simplified and conveyed more effectively to students lacking the Organic Chemistry foundation and better labeling of diagrams would allow us to keep track of the numerous chemical processes. Overall, it provides a tremendously reliable projection of the future of biotechnology applications and how students like myself could apply basic science concepts to productive and life-changing research.
This is one of the best courses available on Coursera for the Biotech enthusiasts. Each module/chapter is designed in a way that covers a lot of important topics. The lectures are recorded by highly experienced industry experts cum professors. I have learned a great deal out of it. If given a chance (many variables) I would personally like to attend a masters or doctoral program in this university. I am a bit disappointed by the fact that the course doesn't offer a certificate. But I would still give it a 5 star for the excellent course structure and contents.
The overall course content was highly informative and gave me a wider range of knowledge but in certain videos i felt that it must be updated to recent content as in some places it was mentioned about the information that was available in 2013 but its 2020 now with so much things that have been developed so an updation would be helpful.. The course has motivated me to further pursue in this domain of biotechnology. I sincerely thank every faculties who made this course very informative.
Good introduction in to the area. Gives even a non-specialist a good understanding of the current state, trends and developments in the field and related areas, as well as provides numerous sources for further reading. I enjoyed taking it, and hope that investing in this course will later pay off by advancing my career.
An excellent introductory course for researchers of Industrial biotechnology. Every aspects of of advancements of industrial applications of biological systems were covered and well explained by experts of respective fields. I highly recommend this course for fellow researchers focused in bio-industrial sector.
This was a very informative and insightful course about the numerous applications of Biotechnology in the industry, and also about the growing futuristic trends in the fields of biopharmaceuticals, bioenergy and biomaterials.I sincerely thank the course instructors for putting up this wonderful course.
Even as a graduate student in MSC biotechnology, i found this course immensely helpful in not only acting as a refresher for all the basic stuff ,but also a good update on the new things going on in parts that are not in my immediate interest. Thanks to the awesome Manchester team for an amazing Mooc!
Overall, a great brush-up course for a biotechnologist but is not at all recommadable to someone new to this field. Applicative part is imprevise and i learnt many new things about molecules i knew but did not acknowledge. I would refer this course to every biotechnology aspirant.
I really enjoyed this course. This course is very interesting and very helpful for me. This course gives me alot of knowledge and interest in this course.I learn many things from this course and really i enjoyed this course...Great course.
Great insight offered by University of Manchester into the field of Industrial Biotechnology. Being a Chemical Engineering student, I learnt a lot, especially the industrial aspects, and realized the tremendous potential in this subject.
