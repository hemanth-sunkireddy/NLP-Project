First of all, I am so sorry I have to give a one-star review for this Human Resources lesson. Those lecturers are experts in the HR field, their lectures are clear and helpful. It is such a pleasure to learn from their lectures. The reason why I give a one-star rate is I believe Coursera's "peer review" assignment procedure is really problematic. "Discussion section" is supposed to be a place that all student share their ideas and experiences, however, it is filled with "Please review my assignment and I will review back with the highest marks" now. I totally understand why this happened now, due to the "peer review" procedure.For me, I have an assignment requires a minimum of 80% to pass the whole specialization. My first attempt got 77% and I thought "Sure, there is definitely some improvement I can make". My second attempt got 79% and guess what? I canceled the subscription and find a real book and some videos from youtube. I believe I can learn from CPHR's NKE materials as well. I just don't understand why I need my classmate's review, especially some of them don't give a shit about assignment quality, to pass the course.Overall, the one-star review is targeted to the problematic "peer review" assignment rather than those respectful lectures.
It is not what I was expecting to learn from this course. The course syllabus seems very good but the actual lectures are not good. I would not recommend this course to any one. I don't think we can call this as introduction of HRM because it doesn't give us any knowledge related with HRM. The only new term to me is the high-road vs. low-road, the rest is the common sense to me.
I am unable to rate this since I feel that this course if more theory and concept oriented and I was looking for actual guidelines on hiring and onboarding.
The peer review process is garbage!
pure information, a lot of "w
My name is written wrong
not knowledgeable enough course came off as common sense we all already know. It was bunch of random information the history of early workers etc
There was some nice insights into macro analysis. The external factors to an organization that you should pay attention to before designing an HR strategy.However, it was too academic and not very practical. The course provides really little real-life examples of situations that organizations face. In addition, sounded a lot like the professor was showing off how smart and academically awarded he was instead of providing useful frameworks and insights.One last thing is that all of it was presented in an extremely boring and badly designed way. Really bad jokes made me want to stop attending the course several times.
NO CERTIFICATES?????????
While the instructor was knowledgeable about the material itself, he is obviously not skilled in actually doing the job of HR so his lectures definitely lacked practical application to various points of the lectures. His questions for the tests/quizzes were reflective of the material however the manner in which he asked the questions was extremely confusing. You often had to read the question over and over in order to determine what it was that he was asking. The test questions from a lecture should be straightforward in a manner that helps determine if the student read the material and if the student comprehended the material. The questions for this class were often very minute or minimally important points of the lecture and very confusing in their structure.
First part of the course was quite good. Types of leadership. HR strategies, different type of motivation and motivators. But week 4 is a complete waste of time - full of obvious statements and demagogy. Final test is also very poorly done. For a paid course such quality of the material is unacceptable
It gives you the overview of the HRM, but the slides are often crowded, confusing and distracting. Please, use less colours and pictures and make better slides with some order.
Did not expect it to be so economics-heavy. Would appreciate more practical tips and strategies with respect to interacting and managing employees. Thank you!
I wish the instructor had provided review slides at the end of each section. Some more complex terms could have been elaborated more clearly.
it was a good course. Maybe the target audience is current HR or people who have experience. This was totally new information for me.
The module of legal was very focus on US which does no apply to international students.
a good one for gaining more knowledge regarding managing people
It is very good to learn and I improved my hr skills
the course is nice but overall i found a bit boring
The course has broadIng my opInIon on HR ROles
Very difficult to follow the instructor.
the presentation should be less colour
Not bad course
It's a good introduction to managing Human Resources. I think it covers enough material for you to really learn more about what it takes to manage, the different perspectives and approaches related to management, a bit of history of where all these thoughts came from. One thing, though, that I believe can be improved on is having the professor be a little bit more interactive in the videos. In some of them, it seemed like he was just reading off a prompt and I found it a little difficult to internalize what he was saying and ended up just reading and taking notes from the transcript. But aside from that, this was a course I thoroughly enjoyed and would advise anyone interested in HR management to take.
Very useful to step into the HR management practice. It provides a foundation to understanding the complexity of HR management strategies and managerial styles. The lessons are quite short but dense and challenging. While a transcript of the videos is always available, I found extremely useful to take my own notes while listening to the videos, stopping and restarting the video as required. and even revisiting previous lectures to establish the necessary connections among notions, where necessary. Some lectures are indeed quite dense and content intricate, but that challenges your learning process.
The course helped me gain the basic understanding of Human Resources. I did have a course in my undergraduate studies in India but this online course was a different experience. Prof. John Budd explained concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand way. The video sessions of HR executive managers  talking gave a real-world exposure. If the course has at least one session where students can interact with the professor John Budd would be good.
The information contained is excellent and I have already learned a lot. However, many questions on quizzes of this course are poorly phrased, causing confusion where clarity would be better. The worst part was actually in the peer review, the grading system was laid out in a way which does not allow you to pass without a perfect score, but this is not indicated. Therefore, people who liked a paper I wrote accidentally did not pass my document based on this fact. It's a shame that the mechanics of the course slowed the pace and made it harder to pass when the instructor is clearly very intelligent and qualified, and provided so much good information. I love the way the information was tied into history and other relevant things as well, being a history buff myself. I do recommend the course, but I would hope that it could be improved mechanically from the user end.
Very Good course.Very Good course.
In my view some needed additions to be excellent. Summaries of the important issues in each lecture video can be introduced might be in a form of Power Point Presentation. This will highlight the main topics. This can be done for each video, each lesson and each module.Prof. Dr. John Budd have already made  these summaries and conclusions during his video lectures, but it is not easy to retrieve when you are searching about some specific subject. You have to here again a group of videos to find what you need.
I like it very much, enjoying doing the task required and review some video several times to be sure that I well understood. I didn't like the law part, even if I can understand why it is necessary, focusing on US laws in a open worldwide on line course is kind of useless, because a lot of people aren't probably from the US. I wish that time were more focusing on giving us practical example on HR practises.
It's understanding Human Resource in a whole new light.  One thing I learned is that all managers who manage people are in effect Human Resource managers and this role is not just limited to the set of staff computing our salaries or creating engagement activities to promote work motivations (pencil pushing).  It's also great to know how to determine and handle different motivations of people to work.
The way all the concepts are explained lays a foundation for the other specialization in the course and i really learned a lot since the way of explaining was so simple that even a layman could bave unerstood.i was really worried whether i should be taking HR or not but after seeing the vedios i got so many valuable insights  i could totally relate. Thanks courseera
Professor John did a pretty amazing job with the structure and content of the lectures in this course -- his delivery was fair, and that's why I withdrew the fifth star rating. I came here looking for a consolidation on my knowledge of introductory HR insights, and I am glad to say I am fulfilled. What an enlightening way to take off into the HR space!
hi this course was great insight I would loved it more in case studies and other actual to do projects could have been a part of it instead of just reading the said blogs or writing the quiz.also m still not able to find my certificate though I have completed the course within 2-3 weeks. please help me out in this manner.
Very good course. The information shared is very valuable to me as a junior manager. Learned lot of new techniques which can be used in my daily managerial work. The course structure and the presentation is very well. It would be nice if the course materials can be downloaded separately for future reference. Thank you.
The coursera course in Preparing to Manage Human Resources has provided me an opportunity to understand the economicals aspect of work and will help to boost my HR related competencies. The flexibility offered by Coursera courses is really a boon for anyone looking to upgrade their individual skill sets to next level.
Parts of this were really interesting.  Ideas around high / low strategy and ensuring alignment between HR and organizational strategy and culture were important reminders.  He jumped over a few important areas that may have added more value, such as employment law and managing to the law.
This course was a great opportunity for me, to have a good understanding about managing people. Teaching method is user friendly. I must thankful to the university of minnesota , for providing this kind of courses. Looking ahead to follow the othercourses in this specialization also.
Great course, with a lot of information packed into a short course.  Well worth it and the time spent on the course kept me active and engaged.  Professor Budd is  great, with his humour, videos, illustrations and readings from his blog all adding to a great learning opportunity.
I found this to be a very helpful course. At times, it was a bit cut and dry, but that might be the nature of the material. Dr. Budd is hilarious and clearly passionate about HR! I appreciated how he brought in HR leaders from the private sector to speak to their experiences.
A great foundational course to set you up for more specific topics.  A lot of interaction through discussion prompts and peer-review assignments.  Videos have moments of disjointedness, but easily to look past (sorry Mr Budd!).  Very excited for this specialization program!
The lecturer was very detailed and seemed to have a broad knowledge of the topic, he was able to merge the past and present to offer excellent and meaningful examples to the subject matter. I definitely recommend the course for managers or aspiring managers.
A well structured course which lays the foundation for further study. The insight provided and the presentation style were appropriate and well delivered. However while understandable the excessive focus on the USA perspective this was not a helpful aspect.
this course is very helpful.I learned about what drives the employees at work and how to motivate them as people managers.this caught how to be become good people managers.i am very thankful to faculty and others who made this course possible.
A great course that developed my understanding of HR .The role of Hr in any organization and their responsibilities. Loved the way taught with so much fun and humor. This course is very beneficial for people thinking to pursue a career in HR
I've learned so many fundamental HR-related things from this course. Its kinda recall type course for those who completed their graduation concentration in HRM. Thanks, Coursera and the University of Minnesota.
Everything was  just excellent!! I would be looking forward to have more additional reading tasks that that help see plactical applications of theoretical material. Thank you very much for a great course!
Great course. I found it to have an excellent pedagogical structure with well researched material and relevant, detailed examples for each concept! The pace of the course could have been tightened a bit.
Interesting but very academic and generalistic course. You should have it before the other courses of specialization but keep going becouse it's very hard to apply this course at work by it self.
Il manque juste une vision du management des ressources humaines basée sur un style plus global voire mondial. Par exemple par continent, pourquoi pas ou par système (francophone vs anglophone).
Overall, it's good. A little piece of advice from me, please set some standards for people who review the assignment to put their comments so then it could be a good review for the reviewer.
A lot of very useful skills to be applied in the workplace. A wide scope of HR  responsibilities and examples to achieve them.Only issue I had was the inconsistency of grading from peers.
Course is good. Gives nice theoretical insights. Giving 4 star as I was expecting to learn some corporate / consultant framework and dashboards and actual applicability of the concepts.
I personally struggled with the U.S Laws because it didn't include my country so I didn't find it relevant but either way it's good to have insight on what happens in other countries
this course helps me a lot in knowing about peoples management , i thought HR is only about hiring and recruiting employees but in this course i learned that it more more than that
I have learned so many things from this course.specially about human nature,General aspect towards work of an employee,laws & how to divert them towards success. Thank you so much
very helpful course and the teacher was very clear. if I can find a drawback, this will be the fact that most of the course is related with the US laws and regulatuions.
Overall the course is informative.  I understand that this is an online course, but the videos can be a little overwhelming at times.  I would recommend this course.
very very informative and the facilitator really made it look simple. i appreciate this opportunity to learn something new, it is of great value to my knowledge base
i really recommend this course for any one who want to know about the basics of  human resources management ..Dr. john really have a good way in teaching ..go on !!
Overall good course. I would appreciate if the slides could've been provided. Also some external resources to further study of the topics covered would add value.
Very good introduction to the topic.  During the line drawing descriptions, it might have been good to incorporate even more discussion on each specific topic.
It was an eye-opening course to determine whether I like to consider HR as my own career or learn the basics so that I become good at managing people.
Great Course for understanding context. The very basics of what work is and why people work helps you t get perspective to different sets of member
This course was very informative. The more theoretical parts were went over very quickly and It would have been nice if there had been more detail.
I like the course, I have finished it in a short period of time , even the instructor's teaching is very simple and way easy to understand the HRM
it's a good a good course in general, it gave you a general idea about human capital management and different management styles. It also brief
This course is one of the best course , as it will give you fundamental and basic knowledge about Human resources and it's management.
I liked this course, no doubt. I have definetly learned a lot and to be honest professor Budd is a good teacher. He does teach well.
I enjoyed the course.  I learned quite a few new concepts.  The focus on economics seemed a little heavy, but overall it was great.
Nice course, although the main focus is on the U.S.. It gets interesting after the first week. (first week is a lot about history)
It was great to learn here,,, kindly try to provide as much as information that you could and try to make it more interesting.
The proper course for me!  My instructor knows to teach and he helps me to understand  what is Human Resources. Thank you!
This is a good course especially if you are new to managing people and want to get an understanding what is HR all about.
Gained valuable insight that can be aplied to many industries.  The concepts given were comprehensive and easy to follow.
This is a great course and I have learnt a great deal, I definitely want to take other courses in this specialization
A very solid intro to how to think about HR, managing, and strategy - very broad, but well-explained and manageable!
A great learning opportunity that enabled me to learn a lot regarding key HR subjects for managing human resources.
The content and the delivery of this course was excellent.  It was engaging and kept delivering quality content.
Very helpful curse for people who want  to discover HR World and for people who want to learn more about HR.
Its nice learning experience. The way of teachings is completely different and points are explained clearly
The course is really well structured, however, Module 2 can be simplified a bit for non-economic students.
It was very interesting and knowledge gaining. The explanations are in very simple and interactive manner.
This is really useful if you want to get to know all the basic knowledge of HRM. Strongly recommend it !
This course has actually improved improved me and I have decided to learn and relearn from the materials
Good basic knowledge of HR. For me, the US law was the less relevant topic but It was interesting.
The course is very detailed. It provides insight to the foundation of human resource management.
I LIKED THE VIDEOS USED IN THE BACKGROUND, WHICH WAS VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS.
I liked the course very much, it would be great if summary is available at each end module.
Good content and nicely organized. Good variety of tasks to complete in manageable parts.
I wish the remaining courses in this specialization will be at the same level of quality.
Thanks for the course in which i learn lot of things . Will i get a certificate for this
It was a clear introductory course. A background in HR although useful is not necessary
Just taking part of the course material was rewarding. A good basic introduction to HRM
The course gives an all around preparetion in order to approach in detail th HR world
Good but need more about the details and should avoid assignment who are experienced
It's an excellent course, very interesting and the presenter is an amazing teacher.
I've learnt a lot. I cant wait to move to the next course in this specialization!
good cource, nice overview, very well presented, interviews with HR professionals
I think the part with the US Laws were a little overwhelming for non-US students
Amazing content, but the graphics and information should be updated to 2020.
Good platform to seek the best courses for which you were dreamed for..!!
it was a great experience such a great lecturer and have a great contains
The professor was excellent. His teaching was clear, fun and very useful.
It's a renowned platform to learn online and develop professional skills.

Nice coures
beautiful!
Very
I really enjoyed this foundation class. It provide me with a deeper understand of human resources beyond just transactional duties. Human Resources is a key component in the life of an organization.
Excellent course structure, very clear and concise material, John Budd is teaching in a fun way, which helped me understand the syllabus, with short questions to help me think and not too long videos.
This is an excellent course! I had no prior knowledge on, nor experience in HR. So, this course served to eradicate my previous misconceptions. I learned more than I expected to; the lessons are packed with extensive information, and the videos are interesting, clear, and sometimes interactive. I will recommend this course to anyone. You won't regret taking it!
This course has an outstanding wealth of information for new people entering the Human Resources arena. I also recommend it to others that want to brush up on knowledge and skills of the HR industry.
I learned a lot from professor Budd! An excellent instructor and the whole team covering the HR Management Specialization really!! I love the fact that you can go at your own pace. They managed to get all the goods in the 5 courses. I'm starting course #4 now and I get more excited as I go because the info provided is so useful.
This course is very effective in improving your role as an HRM and Very good lecture with lots of fun with humor used by the professor during this course.. Thank you sir for the wonderful experience
So far this course has been very informative and is exactly what I need to get my mind ready for a new career in human resources and understanding what human resource really means in the workplace.
Good for people who want to start their career as a manager. This course will give you basics of human resource management.
I enjoyed the format as well as well as content. Thank you.
well designed curriculum and the content is well presented. The peer-reviewed assignment was particularly designed in a structured way, which allows me to connect the dots and apply what I have learned to my own case. I think it is awesome that while the assignment is open-ended, the professor also gave sufficient guideline and mini examples to explain how the question should be answered. Besides the structure, the content itself was insightful and inspiring. As a people manager for five years, I am able to reconcile my own experience and understanding with the employment relationship theories. The people manager value proposition graph which was presented at the first lecture, I wish every new people manager gets to see that on the first day they turn into people manager. It would save tons of effort of them trying to discover the entire landscape of people management and greatly accelerate their learning.
Je suis très heureux d'avoir pris part à cette formation qui a apporté un éclaircissement à la notion de gestion des ressources humaines que que j'appréhendais difficilement et que je limitais au recrutement, à l'encadrement et aux mutations. Je croyais même qu'un bon manager des ressources humaines était celui qui parvenait à aider la direction générale à réduire la masse salariale et étouffer toute éventualité de revendications syndicales avec des primes circonstancielles. Je comprends aujourd'hui que savoir motiver les employés de façon intrinsèque peut être plus bénéfique que juste négocier les primes et  autres motivations pécuniaires. Je comprends aussi l'impact ambivalent des normes sociales qui régissent l'emploi.Thanks a lot, Dear Professor.
A very enjoyable course: not as easy as the subject would let you think. It is a real preparation in the sense that you get an intensive crash course on basics of HR philosophy/history/trends and what's to be expected from a manager.The instructor really made an effort to render the course into a MOOC format. Each course is well documented, his speeches are clear and each sentence has been carefully selected. He summarizes a lot and makes an extra effort to make us understand how each subject is connected to the other. I found him a great pedagog. As for quizzes, you need to understand the subject and not just memorize. Very entertaining. I sure will watch it again!
I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It is a great introduction to the HR world. It kept me interested all the way through. It made me want to take the rest of this HR series to get the certification.
The course was really useful, entertaining and very well made course. Easy to learn and understand. Thank you Mr. Budd, I did enjoy it!
Thanks a lot for your effort with us
super ce cours avec des exemples concrêts et  surtout adaptés aux besoins actuels des enteprises.Partout, les entreprises souffrent d’une pénurie de main-d’œuvre compétente et qualifiée. Dans ce contexte, tous parlent de la nécessité de trouver le talent, de l’acquérir, de le développer, de le retenir et de le gérer, multipliant les stratégies pour garder ces effectifs précieux.La situation globale peut s’avérer paradoxale : d’un côté, du chômage à grande échelle, de l’autre, une abondance d’opportunités d’emploi. Comment expliquer une telle situation? Parce que plusieurs de ces emplois exigent des compétences particulières, et que l’inadéquation entre le travail disponible et le travail spécialisé s’accroît. Comment alors conserver ses acquis en matière de ressources humaines? telles sont les questions traitées et comprises dans ce cours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Professor Budd was quite good.  Obviously the knowledge of HR practices is there and he knows the material but Professor Budd does a fantastic job presenting the material.  His voice fluctuates enough to keep you on your toes but doesn't fluctuate so much that it's hard to follow.  His course used graphics and videos to assist in following his presentations and he does an excellent job of breaking down topics into an easy to follow format.  The class is not easy, even for a seasoned HR person but it's easy to follow and the online format works quite well.  Thank you!!
Great Introductory Course!This was a very enlightening course about HR Manager duties, responsibilities, laws that affect employees and businesses.  Very basic information regarding why people work and how HR Managers are taxed with understanding the workforce needs for their organization and hiring competent individuals.  I learned quite a bit.  Entertaining as well!
Coursera is an online learning platform with a focus on higher education. Much like its competitors Udemy, MasterClass, and Skillshare, Coursera is completely online and covers a wide range of topics.
My name is suresh somnath malvekar from India, i learned new policy about HRM. this course helped me to learns more in details about HR.I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with Coursera. I have loved the learning I have been able to do and look forward to taking many more classes with them. I have always been interested in Psychology and Coursera has given me the chance to take the classes that really interest me. I don't understand the reviews with low ratings. I have never had any problems with them.
A very point to point discussion on the concept of work, why do people basically feel the need to work, assumptions and insights involved, need to manage human resources and alternative mechanisms involved in the management of those vital resources so as to achieve organisational goals in a strategic and effective manner. A big thank you and heartfelt gratitude to Prof John W Budd for his invaluable teachings in this course especially his excellent insight on the thought of work and its various dimensions involved.
This was a very well planned-Interesting and involving course, it made me realize so much about HR that i couldn't have done if i didn't take, the conversations Mr Budd kept having with other HR experts made me realize that on this path i need to do three things: Learn, ask questions and build my own network. I am grateful and so excited i took this course and i am going to Complete it. Mr Budd had the best examples and ways to illustrate certain concepts that otherwise would have been a challenge for me.
The course is well structure and easy to understand. Each lesson is solid and straight to the important points which learners should know. Besides, it helps to remind the knowledge through connecting the previous with the current video. Its questions are also reasonable and helpful.To make the lesson more realistic, it connects with HR professional and create chances for students to listen to their view.In the end, I would like to recommend this course to anyone who has interests in HR.
Always good to have a nice and professional training before climbing the ladder of success. I consider myself very lucky having the opportunity of learning from the rename Carson School of Management. The content of the course is generally focused on the daily grind of the Human Resources department. If you're thinking to change your career or perhaps to improve your skills as a manager this is where you should start
It was a course where I got a certificate by working on various projects and fun case studies. It was a course where I understood alternative HR strategies, the different reasons people work, and the importance of the legal context. It provided a factual and conceptual basis for developing specific critical HRM skills in subsequent courses on recruiting employees, managing performance and rewarding employees.
I found this course very interested since it covers some important tools for managing people through quiz, and some external HR people are being interviewed during the course session, where we can learn from them what they experienced as HR managers, one more thing is, regarding the peer assignment which helped me too,  I would probably advise my friends to take this course, reason why I gave you 5 stars...
This course is clearly defined and laid out in a way that builds on previous knowledge. The instructor is easy to understand and seems passionate about the material, which is always nice! My favorite part about this course is that the instructor provides a multi-disciplinary analysis of understanding labor and economics, and keeps a holistic, balanced approach when presenting different perspectives.
Un curso muy completo, lo elegí específicamente por el enfoque en Gestión (Managment) ya que pude desarrollar mis conceptos sobre este tema, además de profundizar mis conocimientos en un área poco desarrollada dentro de los Recursos Humanos.Altamente recomendable para obtener herramientas de trabajo eficientes y poder comprender la Gestión de los Recursos Humanos como parte estratégica del negocio.
I liked the course as it introduced me to the fundamental concepts of HR. The lectures and explanations were very clear. Its an honor to be facilitated by a Professor with in-depth knowledge who has also authored several books in the field. I am seriously thinking of continuing the rest of the modules as I was very impressed by the structure and delivery of module 1. I am grateful to the Professor
I have always enjoyed online classes ever since I graduated from Ashford University. Attending Ashford University prepared me for taking classes with Coursera. In a way, it gave me a "leg up" on what to expect and how to prepare myself. I enjoyed the class. I learned much about the "at will" labor law more than before I enrolled in the class. I am looking forward to the rest of the classes.
This course is the perfect basis in learning how to manage Human Resources. John Budd is engaging, funny, and shares an array of valuable information. I have left this course prepared with the knowledge of various managerial styles, why they work (and when they work), HR laws and how they differ from the US to other countries, and employee motivations (both monetary and non-monetary).
Fantastic !! Through this course I have learnt very important and necessary knowledge about HR policies, this course has been designed to give knowledge that will be with me for entire of my life, and will be useful in industrial world. Lectures are very thorough and detailed and language is so easy to understand with suitable and relevant industrial examples.Thanks very much :)
Este curso me pareció bastante valioso ya que amplia e integra la visión de RH, desde diferentes perspectivas, deja claro las responsabilidades de la gerencia de RH y pone en perspectiva aspectos históricos y de contexto que permite comprender las tendencias empresariales para que el gerente de HR pueda hacer ajustes y agregar valor desde su campo en la empresa que se encuentre.
The course was refresher for me, after long stint did not study or update myself for any courses.The Human Resource course was a great learning experience. Professor John.W.Budd had provided rich learning experience through his vast teaching experience.Thanks to the Coursera Team,University of Minnesota and Carlson School of Management,providing this valuable opportunity.
this is my first course on coursera. and i loved this. this gave me a clear insight about HR and HR strategies and everything around it. the professor is really skilled and has fun video sessions. i am really looking forward for the other courses in this specialization which i am going to do. !!! highly recommend to anyone wanting a career or wanting to learn about HR.
Excellent foundation course if you want to pursue a career inhuman resources or brush up your HR knowledge both as a specialist and a manager. It teaches how HR adds value to the profitability and purpose of any business and that HR managers play a central role by participating in strategic planning and acting as change masters who clarify the organization's culture.
Great course. I've mistakenly thought of HR job as a much simpler and bureaucratic than it really is. The course is full of interesting insights. I particularly enjoyed systematic, modelling approach. Assumptions on which models are based are clearly outlined and looked at from a critical perspective. Great intro, packed with more information than I thought possible.
I THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT THAT GIVES YOU THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ALL, DEMONSTRATING THAT EDUCATION DOES NOT HAVE BORDERS.THE POWER TO TAKE THIS COURSE IN A UNIVERSITY OF GREAT PRESTIGE AS IT IS MINESSOTA IS FOR ME A GREAT HONOR. ACQUIRING THE TOOLS AND SKILLS NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT MAKES US BE AT THE VANGUARD TO THE GREAT CHALLENGES.
This is a best course for someone who wants to learn what HR is about or explore the field. The course gives flavor of all the different areas in HR in a very easy to understand way. There are frequent quiz and assignments which actually helps to check our understanding a lot. The best part was indeed the peer graded assignments, which encourages to think creatively and helps to connect the theory into practical application. Plus, it allows to read responses by other students, which gives so many new perspectives.
I feel that this course is an absolute commendable course as an basics to know what HR is all about.

It's quite hard but when they explain from the module, they explain clearly so that I can easily understand it, I've learned a lot of here in this course, especially when it comes how to manage people, how to be a good leader to your followers, and be mindful HR manager.
It is a well-curated course that gives you the gist of HR management. I loved how Professor had intense knowledge of HR history, Norms and related it with real-life examples. I enjoyed all Lessons and videos thoroughly and recommend it for anyone who is interested in HR.

So far I have to say it's very informative, very interesting and best of all it's actually useful. I am currently in a position where I am looking to move further into HR from a more recruitment based role and this course is fantastic in setting the foundations for me.
Amazing. Learnt a lot of new things especially the role of psychology and sociology other than economics in the dealing with human relations. Also, for any role in HR, you must understand business first; like how does your organisation make money and all. Great stuff!
The course was absolutely exceptional. I am so happy I got a chance to take part in this awesome program. I was able to relate to the material and identify areas within my professional life where the different managerial styles came out either by myself or my managers
Very good course. I've been working in HR specific field for many years. This course helps me recalled fundamental requirement to be a people manager is real understanding their employees' needs. And then you can use the different kinds of HR tools to motivate them.

It was a great opportunity for me to take this course! The Professor encouraged me to learn more about the HRM field. I wish there would more courses with this Professor related to human resources sphere. Thank you so much for excellent learning way!
The course it very impactful and expository.It was interactive and relatable. And the opportunity to apply for financial aid was helpful and greatly encouraging for a student like that had no financial income to afford to pay for such huge knowledge.
Very good overview on HR. Only one comment - would it be possible to add to the law part another perspective than the US perspective? For participants from other countries it would be great to have some general insights to i.e. European regulations.
This was a well put together and immensely interactive course. My only critique is to allow students to bypass the critique of peers if there are no other assignments to view but one. This prolongs the student being able to receive the certificate.
Completing a course in Coursera is a huge achievement for me. I've really learn alot from this course which could practically be applied to my current job. Thank you very much for the great opportunity. Kudos to Coursera and the People behind it.
It was a great experience.The course is structured in a way which will give you a deep knowledge about the course.Mr.John W. Budd is a wonderful teacher with wealth of knowledge.I really liked the way he keeps the course interesting and engaging.

Interesting and exciting course. At first I thought it was very dry with the instructor tiny in the corner, but the instructor actually has a funny sense of humour and puts in his own personality into the course. Nicely done!
Solid course, more economics than expected but that is not bad thing! I enjoyed it.Peer Review Assignment was a headache, one person failed me for fun, then I had to wait four days to have someone review my assignment again.
So much more academic and theory based than I expected from an online course. Worth so much more than what I paid for it. Highly recommend it for any one who is given responsibility for HR but hasn't been trained to do it.
Thank you Professor Budd! This introductory course is very motivating and I am confident to finish this specialization with an in-depth knowledge in human resource. This could lead me to figure out my future career path!
