It is an excellent course and just in time in view of large
number of employees working from home or from remote sites. It is up-to-date
and current and provide links to knowledge and tools that are current and
evolving. The course provides an excellent resources library which you can use
to further pursue topics of your interest in greater depth. The course is very
well structured, written and presented and very easily to relate to. You can
finish it in a week if you so wish.
This course has been easy to follow, very informative, and most importantly, it provides a trail on how to think about and how to prepare an organization for the future of work.
Relevant and with tons of ideas where to focus, where to spend money and a clear use case for any company that want to be serious about going remote.
Excellent course about remoting cultura, values and best practices. I will recommend all managers in my company to take it.
This course was very enriching.
