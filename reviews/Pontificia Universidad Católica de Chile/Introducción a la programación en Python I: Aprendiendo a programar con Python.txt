Something hard to understand programming tasks. There are must eb a way to do it more interactive. also explain better the assignment and test.
EN GENERAL EL CURSO ES MUY BUENO LA ÚNICA OBJECIÓN QUE TENGO , QUE EN LA PARTE PRACTICA VARIOS EJERCICIOS QUE SE PEDÍAN  SE  REALIZABAN EN FORMA MAS SENCILLA  CON LOS CONTENIDOS DE LA  SEMANA SIGUIENTE Y  AVECES SE PEDÍAN COSAS QUE HABÍA QUE INVESTIGAR , Y UNO PERDIA TIEMPO, YA QUE SE ENTIENDE QUE ESTOS CURSOS LOS TOMA GENTE CON EL TIEMPO LIMITADO. PERO TODO LOS CONTENIDOS ESTÁN REALMENTE A LA ALTURA QUE UNO DESEA , ESPERO QUE TENGAN UN PYTHON 2  MAS ADELANTE GRACIAS
This course clarifies some basic concepts of Python, but also it has some concepts that need to be presented like tuples and dictionary. Professor Ruz explained very well the concepts.
Finished the course since weeks ago, I haven't found a way to show this without upgrading to get certification.  Thank you for accessing the whole course for free.
It's an excellent course to know the basic concepts and the environment ion python.
Very useful course, for people who's recently is learning about Python
Some of the quizzes needed extra knowledge in the topic
More exercises are needed
I think this course was a wonderful opportunity to start an approach to the Python Programming world. I am very happy and confident about what I learned during this course. Thanks!
