please it's my first time  using coursera  and i applied for this course  with the thought that the acoutrements for the study would be translated but i just learnt it can't be, and i've  also applied for financial aid making me uneligible to unenroll.
MUCHAS GRACIAS POR COMPARTIR SUS ENSEÑANZAS CON NOSOTROS APRENDÍ LO SUFICIENTE Y MAS DE LO QUE ME HABIA IMAGINADO EXCELENTE APRENDIZAJE
I would appreciate if it was in English because I’m not able to start the course since I’m not Spanish speaking
it is not in English language all course should be in English because it is international language.
Outdated course and the terms used are very different from what is used in the field.
The language is only spanish/ French that I couldn't understand in the quiz.
I want my Refund
in Spanish
there is not English lounge support in the course it was difficult for me to understand a lot of words
It has to be more dynamic
Excellent course. It would have been nice to receive sample files to work along with the professor. Other than that, I really enjoyed it and it helped me learn about many of the tools MS offers.
