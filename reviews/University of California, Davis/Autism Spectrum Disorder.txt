By the end of the first week of the course, I was feeling that the authors are thinking about ASD as a disease that needs to be cured (as opposed to the idea of neurodiversity). The shameless promo of the MIND institute at the end of week one made me do some research on them — and what do you know, at least two of co-founders are adepts of 'vaccines cause autism' religion, which kind of explains it all. As an adult diagnosed with ASD, I find this course extremely dangerous, misleading and offensive.
The course looks fine, but is slightly weird. Looks more like an advertisement for a while, but some of the data and affirmations are still slightly weird. So, I've checked the comments and it seemed this institution supports the link between autism and vaccines. It's nothing secret, you can find it in their webpage, but I think the course try to avoid the topic on pourpose.Considering the lack of scientific evidence for this, I will not recommend this course.
Lightweight and marginally informative. While it is clearly aimed at a lay audience, a deeper presentation of the scientific foundations of the disorder is sorely needed. If you're interested in the etiology of autism, you'll need to look elsewhere.
Simplistic, not current on most recent developments and research, very little attention given to adults with ASD, and people with ASD very minimally represented.
Quite short videos. Mainly promoting their research rather than a thorough introduction of ASD.
It promotes ABA.
It was good but I didn’t get my certification I bought for it Please contact with me.
this class supports autism speak which is at its worst.
This course portrays autism as something negative by referring to symptoms as "red flags", by supporting Autism Speaks which talks about autism as something horrible that needs to be cured (and who does several other problematic things) and by having ties with institutions who believe/propagate that autism is caused by vaccines. How Coursera let this course on their platform is beyond me and I have already made an official complaint against them. I hope this course gets taken down and that the creators will be ashamed of themselves.
I was really, really hoping that this course would be educational. I personally work with an individual with AS and I excepted to have a better insight into some of the things he goes through. So far, however, I have found many of the lectures condescending. As a person with a disability I find it highly offensive when people speak like they're doing the person with whatever kind of disability a favor for even helping them. People with disabilities are just that, people.
They gave false claims that the course was available in Spanish. How come someone thinks that just because the videos have subtitles, it's considered as an "Spanish Course". I encountered the horrible surprise that the test in each module was in english. How you expect me to answer those questions if I'm not an english speaker, but again, you claim that the course was in Spanish. Shame on you.
Based on stereotypes and unevolved misunderstandings about autism. Little substance supported by the actually autistic community. Not a course that enables understanding of the neurotype.
I found it very easy. But if you do not know anything about Autism, I think you might would contribute from it.
Short, superficial, and sometimes even condescending towards people with ASD.
This course is informative and introductory. It has a value in generating a general awareness about ASD. It would be useful for parents and learners who are new to disability issues. The content can be used for introducing and familiarizing with clinical practice with ASD. But this course has the limitation on following grounds1. The contents of the course are coloured with medical perspective and with pathological view point2. At some point this course appeared like an advertisement for the institute and its research work3. This course tried to cover too many things like theory, practice, research, experience and so on. But at the end it failed to do justice all4. Finally the contents are infected with virus of medicine, market and military science. Terms such as intervention, package, therapy so many terminology. The unfaithful use of "social" in few instance look like an altruism to social science by dominant discipline.  I am sure that this course has market. Evidence based research/ practice will corroborate it. Best wishes
They do have some useful information within this course, but a majority of it is pushed to perceive autistic people as diseased and something to be fixed. One example of this negative teaching is when they provide resources from the hate group Autism Speaks. If you really wish to learn about Autism Spectrum Disorder, youtube videos from autistic individuals would be far more useful and accurate.
O tipo de recurso para as aulas não é interessante, não há leitura complementar e há muitos vídeos para explicar os objetivos de aula, o que deixa o curso bem cansativo, com vídeos que não trazem conhecimento.
Aimed at those needing to get services -- in a spectrum of family living. Too much on California systems, not enough on direct coping with day-to-day.
Lots of theoretical information but very little practical information about what to do with people with Autism Spectrum Disorder
Clear and factual course with well presented materials. I found the scope of the course to be very narrow though, lacking a diversity of perspective and no consideration given to the new directions that international autism research is taking. For example, the challenges to the role of theory of mind in autism deficits or the research being conducted by autistic academics. There are autistic individuals working in academia who are responsible for more than photocopying and making the tea! It is also somewhat telling that Autism speaks features prominently in the recommended reading, not to mention the implied ABA bias in the intervention module.
A good course in terms of content that is shared. Not so good in terms of pedagogy and teaching method.  Doing this course is equivalent to listening someone Voicing power point slides  on the screen word for word 90% of the time. That  is not why most of us join these courses but that is what comprises 90% of the instruction. Balance 10% comprises short videos and interviews with esteemed personalities from Mind Institute, parents of autistic children and of course, Temple Grandin - that is the part worth spending time on. Also the test questions are very poorly set. Why is it important to have 5 questions in a quiz, of which 2 are asking - what percentage of children need this or that - basically testing rote memory of autism statistics? How exactly does that help learning?  Note - I did pass all the tests and the course with flying colors - so this is an impartial observation :)
In general, I enjoyed the contents of the course. It's a general overview that introduces all aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder which is exactly what I wanted. However, half of the final week is a list of established and emerging practices, so this was quite boring. I could have read them off the screen faster. My least favorite aspect of this course is that you can't take the quizzes without buying the certificate. Currently, the certificate won't assist me; I simply wanted to learn more about ASD so as to be more informed. This was quite frustrating because I use the quizzes as a means of checking my understanding and retention of the material.
Very helpful information particularly in the earlier weeks. I found the last couple weeks less helpful because of the large quantity of listed interventions without elaboration/examples - I did read the attached report but would have found it helpful to see some of the interventions demonstrated either via a video or diagram. Temple Grandin is a great documentary and I appreciated hearing her perspective regarding tactile sensitivity. She's also a great example of a person with autism who has developed her strengths and worked around her weaknesses and is a highly functional and successful individual. Overall enjoyed this class. Thanks!
It seems like a good course, with lots of information. However, it is presented so quickly that I am unable to take adequate notes. Points are also made in a circular way, stating a few points and then coming back to each point with more detail, then coming back to those sub-points again. It's very difficult to follow. Finally, some of the extra videos had such poor quality, I couldn't make out what was being said.Disappointing.
The content of the course was very interesting, but it was not something "unique" as such. I am a student of psychology, and most of the content covered is in my basics, so not much seemed challenging. But taken as a course that aims to inform the general population, it did a good job.
Good course covers everything related to ASD ,I feel the lecture goes at a very fast pace without explaining much. anyhow I completely enjoyed the course I being a special educator is confident enough this course has widened my horizons. Thanks to the UC Davis mind institute team.
Interesting material. The course stays on a introductionairy/beginner level, and fails to go deeper. Course finished in a couple hours. Potential to improve by adding more material, scientific articles. Many aspects of the ASD are not discussed in this course, it's not complete
O curso foi interessante e contribui para o aumento do meu conhecimento enquanto técnica, mas considero que contém pouca informação técnica sobre as desregulações, principalmente sensoriais e mentais, e que contém demasiada informação estatística e de investigação.
Could be more computer friendly. Had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them.
There are some errors on the quizzes in between the videos. I had to skip a lot of them because it wound't accept the correct answer. I liked the testimonial videos.
Siento que empezo con muy buena información, pero se quedo corto, creo que pudo ahondar mas en las formas de intervención así como hizo con la narrativa social.
It's very focused on the American system. (which isn't bad, but it's not for me.)there are problems with the sound not fitting with the image shown sometimes
The material was good, but I really think access to the quizzes should be free. Especially since so many lectures all but advertised the UCDavis centre.
The course had some useful content, but there was too much time spent on USA centred materials for an iavailabe course.
Good course ... but it gives so basic information. I wish it gives more deep and specialized information about autism.
overall experience was good, but efforts could be implemented to stream newer videos and develop smarter quizzes
It was interesting but not profound. You had to buy the course in order to submit the quiz.
a good course, especially if you are not too aware of Autism
very basic for an occupational therapist,
Good introduction to ASD.
It is a good introduction couse, but I think it would be really helpfull if they provide further reading for each topic.
Thank you for such great opportunity to study the ASD in completely new way. I am not American, so it was really wonderful for me, to look at ASD from another side.I think this course could be a little bit deeper in questions like teaching methods for children with ASD, but this topic is so big, that it`s hard to learn it just in 5 weeks. Nevertheless, I have finished this course in 1 day, not 5 weeks. I would like to appriciate for the scholarship, which gave me a Certificate, which I will use in my future work.Hope to study more about ASD, so I will think about applying to the University of California, Davis, for Master`s degree. Good luck everybody!
Although it was only a general overview of what autism stands for, this course was quite helpful in explaining the basics. The subject is nevertheless vague even for specialists who cannot exactly point at certain causes or treatments, but it is relieving to know that research is being done and more and more people can receive specialized support for this kind of problems. It's a pity that one cannot finish the course (that means, do the quizzes) without paying for the certificate, and since I don't need a certificate, I still feel like a lost a bit of what might have been a motivation to pay even more attention to certain aspects of the lessons.
This course was a great overview introduction into ASD.  The information was presented so the information was not overwhelming.  You begin the course by looking at ASD from a wide-lens down to details.  This is recommended for anyone who is interested in learning more about ASD and then to take more details classes as needed. The videos that were part of the course were informative.  There was not a lot of discussions nor was this class led by any instructor.   I wished it had links to more articles or more in-depth information, especially the weeks on the developmental areas.
As an autistic female adult myself, I loved the course. t has lots of useful content and easily understood. My only criticism was that it was not mentioned in the sessions how female autism presentation has become more understood in recent years. In the 80's, it was widely agreed upon and taught that Autism only affected males, which we now know is not the case. This has led to an avalanche of females only receiving diagnosis is adulthood, myself included. Please update the course to reflect that. Thanks!
I would like to highlight that the content of the course is well explained. Detailed structure of the course is pretty appreciable and enhancing of the subject knowledge. The quiz provided at the end of every week is a great self knowledge check. What I wish to emphasize at this context is that the area covering the 'Cause'  of this Neuro-developmental disorder should be added in the course. Awareness of the cause of any disorder helps to prevent the occurrence of such disorders. Thanking you!!
Thanks for the great information.  Hope to see more classes with updated information on research and treatment in the future.  As a grandmother of a child with Autism, this type of course is much appreciated to counter all the claims and theories that are made in media, books by non-professionals and anecdotal articles coming from either a romanticized view of Autism or playing on the hopes for a miracle cure that is a predictable phase following diagnosis.
Me encantó el curso, los vídeos, sus  subtitulos en español o guiones de cada vídeo. Me encantaron las ideas de intervención que me dieron, los relatos de padres y de personas con autismo, los vídeos reales. Sin embargo, me gustaría mayor información sobre cómo realizar algunos métodos de intervención basados en la evidencia, a través de descripciones y vídeos donde profesionales los estén aplicando correctamente. Muchas gracias, excelente curso
It was great as an introduction; but would also like more in-depth content. Also perhaps things like how with "an increased rate of autism" (which as we've just learnt is more about an increased rate of accurate diagnosis), what specialists and therapists are doing. Particularly if the diagnosis is done really early on, but also how to move forward if unfortunately it's only managed to be identified a lot later in life.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course! The information taught is well structured and highly relevant and useful in understanding the Autism Spectrum Disorder. What I loved most about it was the sharing of personal experiences from individuals with ASD and their families. However, some of the information may be abit too much and too technical for common folk like me who only require a basic understanding of autism.
A very good course, thank you. I have two criticisms that are intended for constructive purposes: 1. the material is often limited to the USA. Being based in the UK much information, while interesting, does not apply to the state of affairs in the UK. 2. The lists that appear on the slides often fade the first thing on the list as the second appears. This is inconvenient for note taking. Thanks again, Louis
Had a fantastic time with this course! The clear, thoughtfully-made lessons were excellent! My only qualms were that the quizzes were on the easy side and the course only took about 3-5 hours to complete-- definitely something you could complete in a single day if you wanted to! I would have liked more content that would have truly taken me 5 weeks to complete. Thanks for the helpful info!
Very good and clear overview of the diagnosis and characteristics of childhood autism and the assessment and choice of effective evidence-based treatment and education. There is very little about adults with autism, and there is no interaction facilitated between learners or between learners and educators.
This course has a lot of information it. However, I felt I was left with more questions than answers. But, that could also be due to the lack of information and research available. It could also be restructured into a different  order of the classes/weeks.
The course was a very helpful one in giving a holistic understanding of ASD. It offered perspectives of various stakeholders involved. It also facilitated access to a vast arena of evidence based practices in helping individuals with autism.
This course was a good introduction to ASD.  I was hoping to learn more about how to best serve students with ASD, but this course was not designed solely for educators.  I will now look for a more specialized course in ASD.
thank you very much for this very helpful course. It was very beneficial as I have been able to apply directly  in my work setting what I have learned during the last past 5 weeks.
As an instructional aide for special education I found this course very helpful.  Every bit more knowledge we have  about ASD can help us educate and support our students.
Well done overview of autism. The assessment however were way too easy. The quizzes are not difficult at all if you send any time reviewing the material.
An intresting course. Lectures are small and very easy to comprehend. The whole course has a great structure and help you learn and remember things!
Me gustó mucho, información útil, debido a que sólo está en inglés me agrada que no haya actividades a realizar, los exámenes refuerzan lo leído.
I enjoyed the first 3 weeks' lessons much. Next 2 weeks need improvement. More real life videos,experience might have been more helpful.
Nice simple introduction. Opens the doors for learners to follow up on areas of greater detail consistent with their indivudual needs.
very useful course. gave insight into a lot of the issues faced by children with asd. a little more detail would be even more useful.
It is wonderfully created. Although i must confess I was expecting a little more on the side of neurobiological explanations
De verdad muy completo, es ideal para quienes están dando sus primeros pasos en esta materia. totalmente recomendable.
Thanks for the rich and well conducted course. It was very beneficial for me and I recommended it to my friends.
Thank you for this great course which has a lot of valuable information about autism and intervention practices
Curso muito interessante para compreender as últimas compreensões sobre o autismo. Poderia ser mais extenso.
Good but short course. The statment of acomplishment is unaviable. 50$ for short course is a big price
Fue un gran curso para acercarse más a lo que es el TEA y todos los ámbitos que involucra.
wonderfully designed course for an introduction of understanding the spectrum and EBPs.
I enjoyed the well informed videos that aided in understanding ASD. I loved the course
It's a really great class to know about Autism. The information is sufficient as well.
Un gran curso y de mucha ayuda, sin embargo me hubiera gustado que fuera más extenso
Statistics not relevant for those outside of US, but good general info regarding ASD
El curso es muy completo, pero creo que le hacen mucha propaganda a la universidad.
great course. It would be made even better if it included more medicine. Thank you
Nice course deigned by a genius person who think about Inclusion in society.
This course was very insightful and detailed. Enjoyed learning this course
Comprehensive course- gives a good overview of ASD across all age groups.
algunos vídeos no tienen subtitulos en español pero todo bien en general
It was excellent, but I expected more feedback in the discussion forums.
A great overview especially for those with limited knowledge of autism.
The course needs to update data from CDC regarding rates of prevalence.
Very informational. Seemed to be geared towards parents and caretakers.
Very clear and complete for a first approach to the ASD
Really helpfull but more of a general look into autism
Great course. A general look into autism. Thank You.
great initiative and very enlightening. thank you.
An excellent approach to this vast world of ASD
Incluir un poco más de recursos de apoyo
I'd like to learn a bit more about ASD.
Very useful course. Well explained.
Informative for beginners
Great basic information
I enjoyed this course.
Too much USA focus.
nice but too short.
Me encantó. está muy bien hecho, es concreto, da una mirada general pero precisa del espectro, y creo que es muy útil para familias con niños con trastorno del espectro autista, o profesionales que traten con niños con autismo, como profesores, personal de la salud, cuidadores, etc. De verdad muchísimas gracias
Very interesting and informative.  I taught children with special needs for 33 years. I think this course would be very helpful to new teachers and anyone interested in learning basic info on ASD.
My 2-years old niece in China has just been diagnosed as a ASD child. I took this class to help the parents understand the disorder and take prompt steps to start intervention when she is still young. The class is concise and informative. The 5 week contents provide just enough information for parents who have ASD children that has just been diagnosed to briefly understand the challenge and solutions of having an ASD child. I find the videos that illustrates how ASD children behave and what the proper intervention needed from parents, friends, and teachers very useful. By participating the class, I understand what ASD disorder is and I will pass what I have learnt to our big family so everyone has a correct and positive perspective to ASD and offer help to alleviate the anxiety for the parents. This is a very good course.
I took this course about 3 years ago when I was first assigned to work with high functioning students with autism.  Although I had many years of experience working with students in various learning environments,  this position was my first time working specifically with autistic kids.  This course was a real eye opener and helped me better understand how the mind of a person on the spectrum works.  I gained a better understanding of Autism after taking this course and have used many of the strategies taught in this course with my students.  If you are employed in the education system and will be working with students on the spectrum, I would highly recommend taking this course.  The information you will discover about this disorder alone is worth investing the time.
Loved the videos, lots of good material. Wish there had been more discussion, but I was so busy, I might not have been able to participate very much. Overall helpful and useful in my profession.
This course provided an excellent review and knowledge of ASD. I think it is imperative that all staff in a school setting take this course to better become aware and familiar with the students
Enjoyed the breakdown of the lessons from the core characteristics of ASD, to the DSMV diagnostic criteria, increasing rates and demographics, patterns of strengths and weaknesses, the explanation of Theory of Mind, and finally the evidence based practices and interventions. I am glad that massage therapy was listed as an emerging intervention. Massage has helped my son, and many other children on the spectrum, with sensory regulation and activation of the parasympathetic NS to help calm the fight or flight response, and tactile defensiveness. Would love to see UC Davis MIND institute do more research into this area, like that of the Touch Research Institute. Excited for more research and information!
This course has been very informative. Each lecture is very well organized and provides detailed descriptions of the many difficulties that many autistic children have to face and try to learn coping skills  so that they can be in a world that may frighten or upset them. I  did an internship at the League school in Brooklyn and much later saw a child with  Aspergers Syndrome from the age of four to the age thirteen. This course described the many programs and  the availability of information about Autism for teachers and parents. I learned about the wide variety of the symptoms of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I really enjoyed taking the course.
The course is quite amazing.. It improved my knowledge regarding behavioral changes and role of educators and therapist in this field.. I must appreciate the way of delivering lectures and the content.. I wish i could attend classes in UC Davis Mind institute as i found this spectrum quite interesting...  I hope other classes would be conducted regarding Autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders with further content at coursera so that i could better understand the process of dealing with those suffering individuals.. Thankyou v. Much the instructors :)
Such an eye-opening course featuring a remarkable work of the experts at UCDavis Mind Institute. Thank you for sharing such valuable and practical lessons. I like the mini quizzes in between lectures as they help review the lessons in chunks. The videos and the variety of suggested activities are really helpful and make the learning dynamic and exciting, igniting my curiosity (from watching Temple Grandin movie, signing in to Autism Navigator to deepen our understanding to reading the reports on Evidence Based Practices). Thank you so much!
Hola, me encantó el curso. Evidencia una gran cantidad de prácticas basadas en evidencia útiles para el trabajo como profesional de educación. Asimismo permite identificar las principales fortalezas y debilidades que presentan los estudiantes con TEA en algunas áreas cognitivas y académicas y reconocer el trabajo a partir de las fortalezas e intereses de los niños, como también que muchas supuestas "debilidades" pueden ser utilizadas como oportunidades de aprendizaje. Excelente curso, muy claro !! Muchas gracias.
I work in a Verbal Behavior classroom for toddlers diagnosed with ASD, and i am also the mother of a little girl who has Angelman Syndrome (a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with many crossover symptoms of ASD).  I found this to be an very well done introduction and overview of the basic aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder.  I was pleased to see that the sensory integration issue was addressed so nicely.Thank you so much for this course.  I hope it will be helpful to families and new staff alike.
Thank you so much for all the effort to conduct this course.
ASD is not a disease that can be cure only using pills. Lots of interventions,
understanding and tolerances are needed, from parents, siblings, medical
professionals and communities support is important for person with ASD. Person
with ASD can become better with all the support. Education and awareness to the
general public are also helps. This enlighten the burden of parents or
caregivers.
An excellent overview of the developmental characteristics, academic implications and the emotional and behavioral challenges individuals diagnosed with ASD experience.  It also provides some challenges families face when caring for a child with ASD.  The importance of understanding evidence based practices and access to evidence based practices for individuals affected by ASD across the ages is paramount.
The course provided a great introduction to Autism for any level of learner. I have had prior experience with children on the spectrum but found this to still be helpful. Week 5 I think could have been a course by itself! I would recommend this course to others who interact with children on the spectrum in any form whether it is a friend of a family with a child on the spectrum or other roles.
As a new teacher of students with ASD, I am glad this course was available. I learned great background and foundational information which gave me a better understanding of students with ASD. The course also gave lots of information and resources for further study. I will recommend this course for other individuals who work with or interested in learning about individuals with ASD.
This course gives us important information about the ASD which can be usefull for professional who due with kids and adults with ASD such as families whose have kids or adults with the ASD. I am a Brazilian doctor and I've a sister diagnosed with ASD. I'm sure that what I've learned will be very usefull for me either as a professional either as a sibiling of a kid with ASD.
This is a very well organized and very interesting course, with a lot of useful information for those who work or intend to work with children. It also gives you an insight into the world of adults with autism, which is not a subject you can usually hear a lot about. This course can motivate you to investigate further about ASD, and it gives you good reference points.
This course has encouraged me in continuing my studies on the autism spretrum disorder in many aspects. On one side, I am a med student, and all knowlodge on dealing with any disorder is critical, and this course is definitely a base for who is still beggining; on the other hand, I know autists, and studying will help me to be a better friends, colleague and relative
This course is very informative and I have learned what I wanted to know.  I recommend this course to all that are in contact, on any level, with individuals on the Autism Spectrum.  I would like to recommend including what the incidence of co-morbit conditions such as OCD, Depression, ADD/ADHD and the like, in individuals with Autism, at any level.  Thank you
excellent overview of ASD.  You do have quite a few typos in the course text and slides which was distracting.  As a former editor, I would recommend you have someone review your materials--it makes UC Davis and the MIND institute look unprofessional.  .  Also how do I get my certificate of credits earned? The website is not navigable in this respect.
The course presents a great deal of material and statistics regarding the determination of the large range of behaviors associated with children with autism. What was most surprising for me was how many areas of learning, development and social interactions are affected by autism, e.g. Theory of Mind, and how difficult and varied the interventions.
I took this course because my ten year old son was diagnosed with autism. Although the course was developed for a wide range of individuals (from interested laypersons to professionals who work with children and teens)  I would heartily recommend it to any parent, grandparent, sibling, or other relative who would like to know more about ASD.
I loved the course, I learned a great deal of knowledge. There are a lot of information about ASD that I didn't know, the exact and proper definition, the symptoms, red flags, EBPs, among others. I felt hopeful about the Early Start Denver Model, and I hope many young children with ASD are able to participate in this type of intervention.
A well put together course that is easy to follow and understand. The videos and extra reading material enhances the contents and is very useful. The provision to download and the transcripts help to manage time and provides an option to suit ones learning style. A must for people who are beginners in the field of special education.
It's been a wonderful experience for me knowing more about Autism Spectrum Disorder. it provided me a lot of insight into ASD with evidence based practices that has being tested and empirically proven to work in helping children and adult living with autism to reach their full potential. i recommend this course for everyone.
Agradeço pela oportunidade de aprendizado que obtive aqui. Com certeza me ajudarão muito em meu trabalho como professora dos Anos Iniciais do Ensino Fundamental. Parabéns a toda equipe pela organização do curso e obrigada, mais uma vez, pela oportunidade de aperfeiçoar meus conhecimentos com a realização deste curso.
Me encantó el curso, creo que para iniciar en el tema es muy completo. Se puede apreciar las grandes diferencias que existen entre Estados Unidos y Chile en cuanto al tema. Creo que para alguien que solo tiene ganas de aprender y saber un poco más del tema es un curso muy completo y te deja con ganas de más. ¡Feliz!
Este curso amplia mis conocimientos sobre TEA, adquirí un enfoque profesional, profundo y diverso. Me ayudará bastante para ponerlo en práctica con mis estudiantes, también tiene varios enlaces que proporcionan información a los padres y les ayudan a orientar la educación en el hogar.Bastante útil para mi profesión.
Very informative and well presented materials. I found it a very good option as someone without a large amount of background knowledge on the subject, and came out of it with more than I started. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to learn about autism whether in a professional or personal perspective.
I have a new level of appreciation not just in the practices, some of which I was already introduced to by experts and others I encountered here for the first time, but in the unestablished practices which I now see that a lot of professional tend to portray as effective when it is not fact or research based.
Quick to the point in all videos. This was a great experience and I enjoyed learning more about ASD. Mind Institute is very interesting and I will be looking further into what other research they are conducting. This is a A+ class to take if you are looking to further your education on topics concerning ASD.
Really helpful. Very interesting. Especially the focus on evidence based interventions is going to be really helpful at working with people with ASD. As I worked with adults with ASD I found it very good, that this group was referred to too, not only children with ASD. I really enjoyed the course. Thank you!
This was an accessible, interesting and user friendly course. I was able to find several new resources for working with children with Autism that will lead to better outcomes for them in an educational setting. I would recommend to any educator or parent seeking to better understand individuals with autism.
Really nice course. Good videos, clear and informative, in-video quizzes that help memorize the most important aspects in each lecture and indications of supplementary material. Also, very informative about how ASD is treated in general, and especially in California. The interviews with parents are amazing!
My Name is Charles Meyer. I would like to recieve a certificate from the university itself.  I have done courses through Coursera and on completion of the entire programme received the certificate from the said University (I dont mind paying for it to be shipped to me.Kind regards, Charles (+27833766745)
I took this course as a refresher to make sure that I am up to date on the current EBP and diagnostic criteria. I liked the smooth delivery, the effective visual presentation, and the currency of the information. I would recommend this course both as an introduction to ASD and as a refresher.
Very informative for a beginner who wants to go further in this area and help individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Very encouraging and inspiring for a professional to know there are so many other professionals who strive for the same goal of making  lives better for this population.
I had problems to understand better about ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) because my 3 year old daughter been diagnosed as Autism Spectrum Disorder. The doctor explain yet I still couldn't clearly understand about after learning this course I clearly understand what is ASD all about..
I love the information that was given in this training. It helped me learn about how to see signs of autism and so much more! Everything was made easy to follow and understand. I'm so happy I took this and would recommend anyone wanting to get an outlook on Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Amazing course. Helped me learn a lot. I think people around the world really need to understand autism in depth to truly relate to their peers suffering from it. We all know people with ASD and we need to be able to understand them in order to make them feel loved and integrated.
Thank you Ms.Patrica Schetter.And also a big thanks to coursera for giving the opportunity. It was an amazing learning session. The course was structured in elaborate but also an easy to understand manner.  Thanks for the great leaning session. Looking forward to more sessions.
This course was very clear, simple and practical designed to learn about Autism Spectrum Disorder. We get enough information about condition of the people who are struggling with Autism and how we can help them. Thanks a lot Professor, for creating such a useful course. 🌹🙏🏻
I JUST CAN'T EXPRESS HOW MUCH THIS  COURSE HELP IN LEARNING ABOUT AUTISM AND ITS INTERVENTION. BEING AN OPTOMETRIST, OUR FOCUS ARE ALWAYS ON PATIENTS COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES . IT SURELY GONNA HELP ME A LOT. THANK YOU EACH ONE OF YOU WHO MAKE THIS COURSE AVAILABLE.
Very useful, short and easy course which you can finish in two to three nights, with videos shoting the ASD children's activities in real life, plus interviews of their parents and ASD adults doing the sharings. Learn a lot and hope to pursue in a career to support ASD.
Very informative. I teach high school and am seeing more and more students mainstreamed with ASD. For some, it works out, for others it does not. Clearly, a case by case experience. I appreciate being able to take this course online and deepen my understanding of ASD.
ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder remains undiscovered among mass people & also healthcare professionals. Early recognition of symptoms followed by early intervention is necessary for better outcome. Throughout the course it gives an overview about this message.
