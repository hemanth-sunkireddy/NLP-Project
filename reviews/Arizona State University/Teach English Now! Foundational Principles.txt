This course has great videos. I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems. This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400.
I would not refer anyone to this course.  Although the content is well done, the tech piece of the course is sooooooo frustrating.  At one point during the course I kept rating and rating my peersʻ assignments and the system would not accept it.  I later found out there was some kind of tech issue.  There was NO communication from Coursera whatsoever regarding this--no email, nothing to me or the class as a whole.  So, we just had to keep checking and submitting ratings to see if it would finally be accepted.  I find this bizarre, to say the least.  Now, I am in the third course and the SAME thing is happening!  I work full time, have a second job, go to school, raise two boys as a single parent and time is of the essence for me!  I do not have time to waste!  I keep wasting my time with tech issues.  That is so disturbing.  Somehow or another we should be kept abreast of tech platform problems.  This is crazy.
Content is too basic, seems unresearched. Instructor is distracting in manner in which he presents information - overemphasizes acting over content.
low-level content for people with no teaching background
I agree that my feedback
Pretty basic stuff.
Way too basic for the price. I knew by instinct basically everything they taught here. I'm giving them 2 stars because some of the reading excerpts were interesting ways to say what I already knew. I completed the whole thing in one week and then had to wait for others to submit their work so I could finally get my certificate. Don't waste your time, just find a good ESL book, it'll cost less and teach you more. PS: I passed about half of the quizzes without finishing the readings. That's how ridiculously easy this was. I barely learned anything.
The instructors are annoying and long winded about extremely simple concepts. The course is very easy. I completed within 4 or 5 hrs. I was able to jump straight to the quizzes without watching the videos.
There was some interesting information in here, and I found a few things useful.  That said, you have to sift through a lot of gimmicks to get to the parts of the lessons that actually matter.
好难。觉得没讲清楚。而且作业也太让人头疼了
No entendí nada
Worse taught
I'm only rating this course 3 stars because it's just too easy. The information is good (what there is of it) and is presented well. It's just that the amount of effort needed to pass is minimal. For example, the fifth week had fewer assignments than the previous weeks, and the six week was only a quick review. The problem I have with these courses being so easy is that online courses already suffer from the widespread view that they're not as valuable as a "real" in-person course. So, when yet another one of these online courses is incredibly easy to pass, it only adds fuel to those people's arguments and reduces the overall value of the certificate of completion. I want my certificate to mean something. Please stop watering down these courses! Ditch the pay you pass mentality. Include more material to read. Make the tests longer and more difficult. Because, as they are, they don't even compare in difficulty to the junior college courses, much less the university courses, I've taken in the past.
Content is high quality and the professors are engaging. Videos need more visuals than just someone speaking at you 90% of the time though. The quizzes are decent in that I had to actually go back and look at the material a few times to remember the answer, so they're not too easy. But the  writing assignments are kind of a joke in that as long as you write a few sentences of anything remotely related to the content you will get a passing grade. It's good practice to read other people's assignments to see what you might be dealing with in a real English class, but you're not required to actually grade it either. I suppose if you do a video you get to practice speaking to an audience. I plan on doing the full certificate so I hope the next assignments are more worthwhile. For the price of $50 a month it's a good deal. I was able to complete this first part in 2 days, but I suppose if you're working full time or have a family it could take you a lot longer.
There was interesting information in the class, but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas. Many of the answers I read were just repetitions of what was learned in class. I think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out. I also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a grading tool. The parameters for grading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignments. While I learned some useful information, I won't continue with this course.
This class is very easy. It is a decent introduction, but has very little content. It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly. The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking critically. It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge. I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster.
This class felt a bit elementary . . . but it had some good material as well. I would appreciate a bit less overacting and goofiness (which actually praised in the course) and have a bit more academic material. In one of the videos, the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the student's level but not too high. This course seemed to be a bit lower than my level (but I have taken education courses in the past).
Although the information provided by the course is good, I do find it a bit difficult to listen to the videos. In truth, I typically read through the transcripts instead of watching them. I understand the the professor is attempting to provide an interesting and engaging experience, but I end up feeling as though I'm being talked to like I'm a child.
Over animated professor makes it a little difficult to take things seriously. Also the caliber of content leaves much to be desired. The homework was in no way challenging and though is was intended to be thought provoking I just found is demeaning. Why are college professors acting like tv hosts? No clue.
I would give it 5 stars but , staff really needs to start reviewing assignments because there are a couple of bad apples copying the work of  other students.  We work hard and should not have our work plagiarized, but since it is peer review and not teacher graded, they get away with it.
It is really a start in the field. If you already have teaching experience you will get much more from the conversations in the forums than from the lectures. And if you have very little teaching experience or are interested in the field, it will give you a clear overview.
There are issues with submitting assignments (failure to process submission in Coursera).Peer reviews may not be the best solution, as we have to wait a long time for our work to be reviewed!
The content is great, but the course lacks support from the staff. It is also too easy to pass. I hope the reason for this is because the course was introductory.
The course presents valuable information, but I think the real content is too little compared to the length of the videos.
I thought the course was good although some of the material a bit basic but it definitely will help with my teaching.
I would make it a 5 but this course will not list on my "completed courses" and that  annoys me.
Pretty basic stuff but you have to take it to advance to presumably more interesting material
We need extra materials
Fast paced
Lots of good information. I like the instructors' enthusiasm and expertise. However, not so happy about being assessed by my peers--first, I am not getting much feedback, although I am spending considerable time assessing others. Second, I would rather have one of the instructors, or at least someone who has the certification--perhaps a grad student or something--looking at my work. Although I am learning a lot, I feel like I'm one of many being churned out. Not sure how great the overall quality of all the "graduates" will be. I am very self-motivated, but what about others? How to be sure they aren't just going through the motions?
A great start for anyone dreaming about becoming a certified English teacher. Basic principles laconically explained in high-quality videos by a very charismatic professional. Interesting and enlightening concepts helping to look at teaching from a different angle and enrich your own process of doing the job. Unfortunately, there are disadvantages to this too. For anybody whose English is C1 and higher this course will be a little undemanding. Weeks in the course consist of only several short videos and text lectures. But, as I have put it, this course is for beginners and, mostly, for foreigners whose goal is to teach English abroad and get a certificate as fast as possible. Another thing, probably the most crucial for me is lack of feedback from professional teachers regarding evaluation of essays. Your work is evaluated by your peers the majority of which are, firstly, not so well versed in English, making myriads of mistakes along the way without a second thought to correcting them, and, secondly, do not really care about the amount of work you put into your essays. It was quite common to see dry, simplistic "Good." comments without any proper critique. This, of course, does not encompass each and everybody enrolled to this course and has nothing to do with the very course itself, but this is the picture I dealt with most of the time having my essays reviewed. Anyways, the course is worthwhile and will definitely help you.
I have just finished the first course of this specialization. I don't expect it all to be as easy as this was for me. I'd say the coolest thing, the way I see it is that, throughout the whole course, they never talked about grammar or rules, rather about how we learn best; how students are affected by teachers; pitfalls of teacher burnout, how to's a few, and how not to, yes, but they mostly stayed toward the positive. Sure, there were some things which might be a little exclusively for language teaching, but I'd say, more, really, the things they explained were about teaching and learning in general. Anyway, I can get that grammar stuff out of books , on the net, or even on the Youtube. It's what makes me a good or a better or a worse or a useless teacher I want to learn. And up until NOW, it's exactly THAT they've been helping me with. One real waker-upper was when they suggested that neither the world, nor the classroom is ever (and never going to be) perfect. THAT was a load off my mind, and one of the most encouraging teacher helps I've EVER had: like, "Don't look at what you don't have, but what you DO have is what makes you a "professional"! (even if the lights go out!) Many Thanks!              ---Rey Hudson
This was a fun and exciting course. As a practicing teacher it was a great refresher for me and could make the connections necessary to help me along. The pace was not bad, The content was presented in a way that most people would enjoy. Dr. Dixon was a great model, he practiced what he spoke of. the metaphors were refreshing  and gave me new insight  to how I should view learning on a whole. Mrs./Ms. Haraway assisted by  emphasizing the points discussed in the preceding videos were grasped. tyOn the other hand I wish that more time was spent on the theorists that would help learners who were not teachers understand better and make the connections between the cognitive processes and the acquisition of language or any content for that matter. I would also have appreciated small group interactions as some others courses do as group assignments and i wish that there was direct feedback from the tutors . I think that it would help authenticate the course even more.I am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me .
I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has little experience or really needs to learn classroom strategies for teaching language, or even teaching in general. I'm not giving it 5 stars because even though I can't say I didn't learn anything from it (I did), 39.99 per course for a few courses (is it 3, 4 total?) is a little much for me. I was seeking something for my professional development, I don't regret it. The teacher in this is very clear and charismatic, the information is easy to understand and never boring, and the strategies and theory, which is only discussed lightly (with additional resources) is extremely useful. I understand why it's a paid course, but it's pricey for my teacher salary.
Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses. The peer assessments are potentially interesting but, in practice, the majority are so trivial--3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures--as to be hardly worth reading. Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading, the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted.The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others. . .  not. I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I'm a boring old sod!
I think it's a really good opportunity to be able to obtain a TESOL certificate online and this course seems to be able to do it very efficiently. However, I have found the approach of the style of the lessons a little bit slow and too dramatic- and somewhat even childish. I'm sure the planning of this certificate program is to ensure that people who take it will remember it so that they can really make use of it in their profession- so they probably avoided long and boring lectures. But still, I must admit that the lessons look a little bit annoying sometimes :) Still, thank you for the opportunity.
This course was and still is a great start for individuals who want to start their teaching carriers. It contains amazing videos, readings and assignments. The missing 'STAR" was for the peer graded assignments. Even though my assignments were graded in a short time by my friends and peers, others really had to wait a bit longer. But their assignments were graded finally. To sum up, I recommend you to enroll in this course as well as to the other five courses by AZU.
The course is good enough--a means to an end. The 4-part, six weeks apart format is kind of bothersome because the wait period sort of dampens the momentum and enthusiasm created during the first course (especially if you complete the whole thing in a week-end).  The course is well put together and infused with a little humor. The visuals are good and if you're in the right mood, the course is enjoyable and ifun to interact with folks from around the world.
This is a fun, informative and helpful class for anyone wanting to become an effective language teacher. It's a nice mix of best practices and proven techniques that really work. I'm more confident and encouraged by this constructive approach toward teaching teachers how to most effectively help and motivate adult students to learn a new language. The ASU presenters and content team are very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching.
For a neophyte to online learning, I feel lucky to undergo a course where the instructor/ course presenter made the lessons easy to understand, the lectures were presented as if the instructor and the learner are in the same room and not just the presenter talking to the camera.  It became easy for me to finish up the segment of the specialization and was driven to push through with the entire course because of it. Kudos to you all!
Excellent teaching but not as amazingly easy to access as the linguistics course or the Mandarin courses I took, probably because of the demand.  I had to complain several times because I was sometimes directed to a module I had already completed.  I was charged twice in September, once on the 2nd and again on the 10th.  I supposedly began for free, so I think my first charge should have been on the 10th.
The course is very inspiring and educational. I do appreciate that coursera and ASU can put this course on site. It synthesizes education theories and actual teaching experiences. However, I do think this course would improve a lot if teaching practices could be incorporated because for teaching professionals the teaching itself is the most important thing.
well organized, user friendly, brief but informative, based on videos (nevertheless, a transcription is always provided), if you are fond of metaphors you will definitely enjoy it. you have a choice to prepare a video clip (if you prefer the spoken language) or an essay (if you prefer the written language) for each assignment
This is the first time I am taking any course online and I enjoyed this course.  I felt that it was a good introduction to how to establish the steps for a good foundation for ESL teachers. I am now taking the second course to further my progress toward my certification through ASU.  Thank you for this opportunity!
Estuvo muy bueno, de pronto sería bueno incluir más videos en los que se pone en práctica los distintos principios. De todas maneras, debo reconocer que es una muy buena alternativa para aquellos que se inician en la enseñanza y quieren tener una idea más clara sobre lo que implica enseñar. Felicitaciones!!!
The content is clear and the instructors are engaging. However, I was expecting the course to focus more onto how to teach English like how to teach grammars etc. Nonetheless, I learnt a great deal. It helped me to revise some of the things I had learnt in teaching college. I enjoyed the course thoroughly.
The content of the course is really good, it has been really clear, well structured and made with the best information. I grade it with 4 starts because I think the peer reviewed assigntments needs some development and of course everything can be improved. anyway, this is a great course and I recomend it.
I have been teaching for a while, and I am familiar with most of the information presented in this course. Nevertheless, I took it because I would like to complete the entire set to receive the TESOL certificate. It might be useful for those considering to become teachers in the near future.
Overall, I am satisfied with the course. Although I find the Quiz a bit unchallenging. I hope they don't just recycle questions at the end of the module but really ask deeper or more complex questions so that fellow students will really think more and analyze how to answer these questions.
Although it is an introductory course I would have preferred to have a hard course in this first part. However it is an excellent course and it sheds light on many topics in the teaching area. I strongly recommend it to everybody interested in learning more about English teaching.
The course portrays the general overview of being an English teacher, the main reflections on classroom language instruction and mainly focusing on the students language acquisition, opening our eyes to understand the opportunities us teachers have every single class we teach at.
I know that it would be near impossible to do this on a website like Coursera where thousands of people are probably enrolled in your course, but it would be great if there was some real evaluation (teachers or experienced alums to comment on the quality) of our essays/responses.
Thank you to the team for insightful learning - and for being such good teachers!You helped me deal with myths about teaching and specifically language teaching and inspires me to keep going. Your work is structured, well researched and yo are fund to watch Dr Dixon!Well done.
A nice introductory course. For people that already have some Teaching or Language Acquisition under their belt, there may be some feeling of review. However, there is also valuable information and fresh angles on how to look at some aspects of language learning and teaching.
I learned some great techniques in this course, one in particular is to the 80/20 rule.  Language teachers should allow learners to talk more, and teachers talk less!  My only drawback is that I could not see my own responses to Essential Questions or feedback from my peers.
Great! If this was the first I'm excited to start the others. The content is very instructive, a lot of concepts and useful tools. They should add more content per week, because is too little material to study per week. Thus, sometimes it seens to be boring. But it's ok.
I liked the course and I found it useful . I will recommend it to my friends. However , some of the instructions are not clear. I understood that I have time to catch up till Dec 21st. But now, My assignment and editing are not accepted and I want to know what I can do.
This course presented the material in a very clear and understandable manner. The instructors used a lot of great metaphors and examples to engage learners and clarify the content. Anyone could take this course whether you have teaching experience or not.
I enjoyed the course and the way the content was distributed. I did however think some of the MCQs in the quizzes were slightly vague in what they demanded. They were too subjective to be part of a quiz. Other than that, I enjoyed it and learnt a lot.
I really liked the course, as it was intuitive, well set-up and good to handle in an every-day-setting. And although I understand that the videos are meant to inspire the students (teachers), sometimes the childlike approach gets a little bit to much.
This course is such a great example of micro learning. I could learn new things in very simple ways. The content is great, the website is very supportive. I totally recommend this course to anyone who wants to teach.
Hi dears , It was good and informative; I learned a lot from the course.
But I think it would be much better if we had had the review of the lecturers on our assignment at least one time during the course.Thanks
In the first week the course gave a bonus video called Teacher Talk. This could be gave for each week, a great lecture based on theories and techniques taught during the course, recorded from real world classes.
Good course and well presented. Mostly fairly common sense and straight forward. Very easy to pass. Could be a little more challenging perhaps but overall a good basic foundational course. Thanks very much.
Really fun and easy.  The course was cleverly presented and I appreciated the emphasis on some of the notables in the field.  It wasn't very challenging or it would have been five stars.  Nice.
It was incredible how many things I've learned and improved with this course. From the way I teach English to how to relate to my colleagues, it's undeniable I've learned a lot. Thank you!
The course itself is informative and helpful and I liked the quizzes, the peer graded assignments seem erroneous and it takes a long time for your submissions to be graded by anyone.
Some quizzes have glitches and even though i've selected the correct answer, it showed that I was wrong until I have to retake it twice to only use the same answer and get it right.
Love the layout and that I can work at my own pace! I do not like that I have to wait on other people to grade my writing responses though. Other than that I have learned a lot!
thanks for every thing , the most thing i loved in this course is to not being an actor , and i hope you to find a more better way to activate students and teacher communication
It was really a great experience for me, so much helpful information and tools that can help new teachers. Thanks to all the Doctors and the staff for making this course.
I really enjoy the content of this course and the layout. The course is easy to follow and the layout makes it easy to stay on track. The course is fun and intriguing!
I found this course very good for new teachers, but a little repetitive for experience teachers. Still, a great course implemented with knowledge and enthusiasm.
O curso é bem fraco para pessoas que já tenham conhecimento em ensino de inglês como língua estrangeira, porém possui pontos fortes para quem está começando.
It gives a great introduction to language teaching! The only thing I think could make it better is to add more challenging questions to the weekly quizzes.
It would have been a five star review if all the assignments weren't the same :( It gets boring doing the same thing over and over and over again!
The same reason with course 2 . This course is perfect . I would recommend this one to my friends if any one needs it . But not  friend around me
This was a good class. The peers gave good feedback. It was a basic class that could be taken by someone who did not have classroom experience.
I found Course 1 of the 4 courses to be of great benefit, not only to teaching English - but to teaching, supporting, and learning in general.
I loved the course. I think it gives very applicable advice to those of us who want to teach English as a second language.Thank you Coursera.
hi its ayesha all i can say is every teacher should regardless of subject and field as language is a meager part of any learning experience
It's awesome even though I taught English for 6 years. I do recommend ASU to make it also suitable for children not only adults oriented.
It was a nice experience for me.I learned a lot and will surely apply the techniques in my teaching.Bundle of thanks to the Instructors.
Great teachers, fantastic techniques and information. My only complain is that the certificate doesn't comes with the number of hours.
Most of videos are great but I think instructors can provide more details for each one, because most of ideas are general and normal.
I found this course amazing for biginner teachers. It helps with basic understanding of what is important for a great teacher to do.
Well, it's an amazing and useful course .. What i'm trying to say is that, when it comes to teaching ,This course is the best one.
The discussions in the last three week were shallow. However, I liked the first three weeks. I really appreciate your work. Thanks
Good teaching pace for busy learners and excellent use of metaphors to convey the courses' most important theoretical concepts.
From this course We can know some detail about teach English,and this foundational principles  will apply in our work.
Solid foundational course in the world of L2 instruction.  I enjoyed this class and look forward to future coursework.
Enjoyed the entire course and videos.  Very informative and entertaining.  I love the passion of all the presenters.
This course is really good for the ones, who, like me, want to learn more about teaching English for basic learners.
It really helped me to understand the principles of teaching a language even thought I have not a teaching career.
Course was good but I thought more could of been added to the content to make more understandable. For ex. videos
The course is simply awesome. The content is perfectly suitable for the foundation of this course actual vision.
It was a very useful course. The ideas were simplified by giving simple examples which are not easily forgotten!
A great program, easy to follow and interesting. A great program for those interested in teaching as a career.
This course is very useful and important to anyone who cares about teaching the language.Thanks Shane Dixon.
The course was really amazing and has taught me a lot of things regarding teaching and learning as a whole.
I recommend this informative and interesting course, I have been learning more than I had thought I would.
The previous Coursera forum format was far more useful than the current, new, format used in this course.
Great content!Love the dynamic of every lesson.Really happy and thankfull for all the  knowledge shared.
I totally enjoyed taking this course and unreservedly recommend to every English teacher, old and new.
I get a lot of teaching technic, teacher behaviour, helping student with different ways. Great course.
Almost lost me on the first week but so glad I stayed because this course contains some real gems.
The only thing is I would have liked to have the chance to give more detailed peer reviews.
This course has been quite impactful and is highly recommended for all language teachers.
It was a great learning experience! I'm looking forward to finishing rest of the modules.
I really enjoyed the class.  The videos were interesting, entertaining, and educational.
Good course. I would have preferred some more depth on the topics covered for 5 stars.
Well presented and useful information. I look forward to the next module in the series
Little confusing and unclear with peer evaluations communication method/channel here.
Take this course if you are a teacher. Don't care about your main teaching subject.
I really enjoyed this course. The videos are really informative, yet entertaining.
On overall its a very good course, but assignment submission was a bit confusing !
Thanks so much, I really got a great benefit that will help me while teaching :)
Good basic course for anyone interested in starting to study language teaching
It was a good introduction to the world of teaching any language! Thank you
it was great , instructors were amazing and very helpfulThanks a lot guys
The course is very interesting, however there were some technical issues.
A little bit slow but with lots of good examples to makeeverything clear
The course is good; Little be over in acting, but I can understand why!
Very fundational. No specific classroom ideas, but the important conce
Good Course. Would have been nice to have some more interactive bits.
It's a good course that teach me the basic foundation about teaching
These are valuable experience transferred nicely by great educators.
I liked a lot, thank you very much for share your knowledge with us.
Above all, I love the teacher!! So I could focus on learning more!!
I think that assessments are too easy and don't urge you to think.
the course was so helpful but i wised if it were more higher level
the teaching techniques are superb and schedule is accomodative
I like watching these training videos, I leaned a lot from it
I really enjoyed it! I hope i can continue the other courses
It was a great experience!!! I recommend it, i learned a lot
Really great course for beginning and experienced teachers.
this class is very helpful and enjoyable to participate in
Very Detailed Course and quite interesting and informative
I enjoyed and feel that learnt a lot with this course.
I Love this course, and I need more reviewing from you
easy for new learners, but practical and meaningful!
Learned a lot about teaching one of the best course
Very interesting and useful course.Thanks a lot !
Energetic teacher and well organized schedule
It was more of theoretical than practical.
A thoroughly enjoyable and useful course.
A little too basic in my point of view.
Lo maximoEsta demasiado interesante
Very interesting and fun to learn!
amazing .. easy .. learn you much
it was a wonderful experience.
I just started and I loved it!
I liked this course very much
Excellent content. Thank you.
really appreciate your work
It was a bit corny at times
best course not boring
如果试题都有答案让我知道我错在哪里就更好了。
thanks...good course
Still in progress
Nice course 😊
it's very nice
It's marvelous
I enjoyed it.
too general
The friendly way that the course was delivered and the many forms of feedback and assessment throughout the course was just very eye opening in a wonderful way. Thank you!
Teach English Now! Foundation Principles was a great course! There was a lot of interaction with other peers studying the course and the exceptional quality of this online course. The teacher's were very engaging and really made the course very fun and exciting! The coursework wasn't very demanding but the content and delivery of the course was some of the best! Thank you to the whole team for making this online course a joy to participate in!
Great course! Nice content and great presentation of the material. Useful not only for ESL teachers, but for all language teachers and even for teachers in general. Thank you for creating this course!
The material is very easy to understand, useful, and motivating. I loved the videos, and the suggested reading material you provided.
My name is Abdel Aziz Bakari.I really appreciated this course.It's helpful for teaching English.It help you obtained techniques in Teaching.I thank the teaching staff for their time and effort.They are really professionals.Best regards,Abdel Aziz Bakari
Great and meaningful content pleasantly delivered by the teachers. I've learnt so much from this course, not only as a prospective English tutor, but also as a Russian and German language learner.
Thank you so much for this opportunity to learn. I come from a precarious environment of social disorders, and I now have the means to an end. It looks it will be a very good journey... thank you!
Great course and content, got the foundation and basics as promised, I actually even though I have experience teaching I did learn a couple of things in this one.
A highly informative, applicable& easy to follow course by absolutely knowledgeable professors. The thorough, well-organized& engaging course content reflects the the professionalism & the extensive knowledge of the professors in this field. Really looking forward to enrolling in other courses by the same professors & Arizona State University . Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you.
A great course! It is a well planned and goes light taking into consideration that the learners work as teachers.  I have become a great fan of Dr. Dixon and hope to learn more in the modules to come.
This is a very useful course as I begin my studies to prepare to teach English abroad.  ASU is a recognized university and the price is very reasonable.  I look forward to the next course in the series.
Simply amazing. Loved every single minute of it. I feel myself a much better teacher, I’ve learnt how to see resources to give a better class as well as offer my students better practices of learning.
I think this course gives a good basic overview of the skills needed to Teach English as a Second Language. It's simple to understand and I like that the assignments allow room for interpretation.
Very interesting and thought-provoking.
Well designed and beautifully taught.
Useful course...
I enjoyed all the videos by Dr Shane Dixon.  He is a very good actor indeed and his explanations are so lively.  I learnt different teaching concepts and am looking forward to apply them in my lessons.
I don't know how to express gratitude the way I'm feeling right now. This course has done a great deal in tapping up my Intrinsic Motivation, I mean I wasn't aware that English Teaching is such an exciting and happening domain. Being an English Literature student, we're encouraged or rather trained more to acquire "good content", so I was rather always dreaded subconsciously how I'd take up teaching English as my profession as I'm lacking required skills. But, with completing the course, I realize how effectively we can master the teaching art by following few simple techniques.Dr. Shane Dixon, special thanks to you for such an invigorating presentation of the modules.Thanks to Dr. Justin Shewell, Andrea Murau Haraway, and Emilia Gracia as well for this awesome course.
This course was exciting, insightful, and extremely helpful. The instructor broke down the material using metaphors to help learn the proper techniques for teaching second language learners. After taking this course, I feel more confident about my techniques to deliver content and practice to my students.
The video format is excellent: I could listen and follow along in text. The course material was engaging, and elicited a wide range of responses from me. I found, however, that the material was at times too simplistically presented. The complex and nuanced issues of teaching language could have been emphasized more fully. I very much enjoyed thinking about the issues the lessons raised, and very much enjoyed writing about those issues. I will say that the assignment guidelines were rather broad. For instance, writing one to four paragraphs strikes me as not being a meaningful bar to reach. Some peers wrote very little, despite the richness of the essential question. I was interested to see non-native English speakers in the group of peers. For some, understandably, this meant their writing needed more attention. Yet, I was interested to hear about their educational context--Erbil, Iraq, for instance! If the guidelines were more robust than they are, it might be that class participants would respond to essential questions in truly perspective-opening ways for the rest of us. It might be, for instance, that we could see the social dynamics of learning in play, and how at least one person might respond to those educational conditions. I would have welcomed that!
Very interesting class.  I've taught for decades and learned principles I've never heard before. I enjoyed the professors enthusiasm and straightforwardness.  Very key skills learned including the 80/20 rule, being myself, how to avoid burnout, how to make the meaning of words clear. I'm looking forward to digging in to the next course!
Fantastic course. We learn a lot without feeling overwhelmed in any way because the course has been structured beautifully to convey information in a clear and concise manner. Highly recommend!
The course is really helping me with strategies I can use in a diverse community. It is helping me understand my students better and encouraging me to take risks.
Excelente curso aprendi mucho mas de lo que esperaba y perfeccione muchas tecnicas, muy recomendable para extender tu habilidades como maestro de ingles
very helpful and well explained
I highly recommend this course for those who wish to learn and teach English as a Second Language.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to be in this program where I have learned a great deal right from the very beginning of this course up to the last discussion of the topic... that I couldn't help but finished the course earlier than the usual scheduled date... and that I have to rate this course  TEN (from 1-10 where ten is the highest).  It was such a nice experience to learn something new, or even if some aspects I learned it before but I have gained a tremendous, in-depth knowledge and solid foundation about this course:  like the use of metaphors, the Grasser's theory of intrinsic motivation, the Vygostky's scaffolding, Body Language and the teachers talk, the i+1 learning, the 80/20 rule, the diffuse mode and focused mode of learning and more!.  And one thing that I really enjoyed more was the assumptions or the essential questions in the assignment which involved critical thinking.  Thank you so much for this course, and to all the staff who created this language learning website, to the staff behind the scene and especially to Dr. Shane Dixon thank you for generously sharing your knowledge and expertise on this field.  I salute you! Very impressive!!! Thank you!
Teachers should be aware of the basic language learning the understanding of basic techniques on how to make the meaning clear, how to help motivate students by improving teacher's talk, scaffolding and body talk. I like the use of metaphors all over the modules. New theories of learning like Vygotsky and Krashen of leaning zones and Glasser of intrinsic motivation. Teachers talk strategies of focusing on meaning using signpost expressions I learned a lot about acquisition versus learning and the two different modes of the focused and diffuse mode. I learned how to create and change the environment of learning. It was a good idea to talk about language as a stage with a relation of self-awareness and the affective filter . Good language learners of predicting using selective attention prepare, look ridiculous, practice, ask the question, take notes. learners need not just to learn, but how to learn. We faced the problem of time learning at schools. The importance of the role of teachers to empower students to go outside to the global community supported by successful teachers.The best expression for me when teachers represent the candle to enlight the learner's way.
I truly enjoyed this course.  I learned a lot and it helped me understand the importance of techniques, student input, establishing a positive relationship,, and the importance of forming an autonomous learner.  I liked the way the material was organized, it helped me understand better how language theories have evolved and how it's important to keep up with language theories and practices.  The role of technology in language learning finally made a lot of sense!  It really is a wonderful tool for both teacher and student.  I hope to learn more about the resources offered by on line language publishers and educators. I would like to know more about using technology to enhance my teaching and how I can apply these tools to my daily teaching and planning.  This course is really a gem.  It's inspiring and very applicable to learning how to perform at your best as a language teacher.  I look forward to the next course. Thank you all.  Cristina Stern
Wow, I learned so much in this course. I was able to apply what I was learning every week to my teaching, and I am telling you every week I was seeing instant positive results in my classes by applying what I learned in this course. Freaking amazing, I was drowning so to speak up until I found this course because I was teaching but I didn't really know how to teach, but when you're abroad, the opportunity to teach is so available, people will hire you without much experience at all, but I found myself wanting to give more to my students than just a warm body in the room. I wanted to make it fun and interesting for them, and I wanted them to actually learn stuff too. I didn't quite know how to go about it, I didn't know which techniques were good and/or bad. This course, in a nutshell, taught me all of that and more. Great stuff, best money spent this year. So worth the money, seeing how much I got back from it immediately.
This course is AMAZING!!! Dr. (but I think of him as Professor) Shane Dixon completely changed my perception of online courses - which I (given a couple previous experiences) assumed to be universally boring and impersonal. He makes each lesson exciting, engaging, easy to learn, relevant - and  very much memorable. He uses video, images, storytelling, body language, all sorts of aids to get his points across and to make ideas stick in your mind. Frankly, he makes classes FUN, instead of a chore. Shane quickly becomes your favorite teacher, one that you would love to grab lunch with and have long discussions. My goal in taking this class is to eventually become a teacher; if I can become 1/3 as good as he is, I'll consider myself lucky!  Thank you so much Shane, for teaching us how to be great teachers with your own example.
Great introduction to the foundations of language learning and teaching.  If you apply yourself in the course, you will gain a lot out of it!  (Use the learning strategies presented!) Taking notes and putting thought into the written assignments is worth it.  I finished the course quickly, and am walking away with a number of valuable insights.  I'm really looking forward to the second course.  The only thing I would improve is that I'd like to see other students put more effort into their peer reviewed assignments. Sometimes it seems like people just write whatever is on their mind and they don't support their opinions with course materials.  When students use course concepts to support their opinions, I have really appreciated their perspective and efforts to use what they learn to form answers to the questions.
This course is presented very well.  The team put together an effective presentation, in my opinion, of important techniques for teaching language.  In addition to presenting the facts, the entire course serves as an example of the techniques taught in the class.  The material was clear, thorough, and important.  I enjoyed the videos and had no problem with the assignments; in addition, the peer reviews were very informative and provided other perspectives from students in many parts of the world.  This was my favorite assignment because I liked learning from others, but it also highlights the importance of taking this class!  What better example for the purpose of TESOL than to be able to communicate with others in the world!   I'm encouraged to continue the program and feel great about the accomplishment.
Great course! I've always wanted to shift my career into teaching English language, but I've always been so intimidated (one reason is me being a non-native English speaker). I always felt that I wasn't cut out for the job. But getting through this course gave me the confidence and a push to go after what I really want. I must say, that it successfully enshrined the foundational principles that a teacher needs for teaching language. Even if this is an online course, even if I'm just watching the lessons from a small screen, Dr. Dixon's words really helped me lot in changing my perspective towards teaching profession. I just really hope I get to finish the whole course, and I look forward to where this might take me. Thank you so much!
Wow!!!!! This is the most interesting course i have ever been privileged to receive. For me,from what i have experenced in this course,i can say in authority that,pursuing a course online is the most flexible and effective means of  studies.I really enjoyed every module of the course.And my knowledge as a professional teacher has been deeply enhanced immensely.The lecturers are very competent,efficient and effective in their fields.I wholeheartedly thank our affable,hardworking,and dedicated lecturers such as Dr Shane Dixon,Dr Andrea Haraway and the others who  selflessly took us through this courrse successfully. It is my greatest wish that i could get privilege to complete the subsequent courses left successfully.Thank you.
Hello everyone! This is an absolutely fantastic course. The way all the basics are tied together makes this very important learning and brought varied aspects of teaching into  proper focus.  Though as someone who has been teaching English for a long time, I was aware of some of these techniques already, I have learnt a lot more in this course than I have in all those years. Dr. Shane Dixon's delivery is impeccable and so effective. It's motivating to hear that faculty as accomplished as Dr. Dixon and Andrea Haraway face these issues too. Anyone who takes joy and pride in teaching will benefit tremendously from this course. Thank you so much to everyone who has been part of putting together this course. Highly recommend!
I recommend this course to people who want to start or have just started the teaching career. The course is very encouraging. The metaphorical language used by professors facilitates understanding of the main teaching concepts and principles. I found metaphors of the week inspiring.
Suggested readings introduce the fundamentals of language learning and acquisition. Dr Krashen’s, Lev Vygotsky’s, and Bloom’s ideas are constantly retrieved thus easily acquired. Other readings contribute to understanding the teaching philosophy as well. At the end of the course I put together a list of effective teacher’s and learner’s techniques which I apply to task designing. I find my classes have more effective student engagement now.
Hi I am Onur and I just finished my first courseon the way to have ASU TESOL Professional certificate. Frankly speaking the content of the course is one of the best among the other related courses yet it has some pros and cons.Pros:Great metaphors that you can use in your class,Everything was explained in a very friendly way,You don't have to spend lots of time by studying,You surely will find great paragraphs about language learning issues,Cons:Feedback system  for assignments  was not as I thought, so do not wait for any kind of authoritive feedback,Questions in the quiz part should have been more difficult , many of them can be answered with a little informationYou can be a fan of Mr. Dixon :)
I very much enjoyed my first Teach English Now! course, and intend to continue with the next 7 courses to complete my TESOL Certificate. I think that, although I don't generally enjoy watching videos, the videos were short enough to keep my interest, and the content was excellent. I did not become bored or tune out, it felt like all of the content was relevant, and the sequencing of the material worked well for me. My general feeling was that I was learning a lot in a short time, and I felt quite motivated to continue making progress. I attribute part of that to my level of interest in the topic, and part to the presentation and delivery of the course. Excited to continue. Thanks very much!
For weeks, I scoured the internet trying to find an online TESOL/TEFL certificate that met my needs and it felt overwhelming. Some of them were extremely cheap, some were fairly expensive, but very few were offered fully online and endorsed by an accredited university. I graduated college last year and the memory of how those online courses were structured was still fresh in my mind. I was overjoyed to feel right at home with not only the format but the quality of content. Dr. Dixon reminds of professors I had in college and seems so approachable with his silliness and yet you can tell he has so much to offer. This is only the first course but I feel very confident going forward.
Dr. Shane Dixon, Jessica Cinco, and Dr. Justin Shewell make the course so fun and engaging that you almost feel that you are doing no work at all.  They used metaphors and skits which made material which could have been boring and tedious, exciting and easy to remember.  Non-native English speakers will find this course easy to follow, as the instructors do not speak too fast nor use advanced vocabulary where unnecessary.  They present theory, but this course teaches on another level as you can see how the instructors themselves implement these theories in the way they teach you the course.  It says that the course takes six weeks, but if you work hard you can finish it in one.
I'm so grateful to the team of the Teach English Now! Foundational Principles. In fact I went through trial and error before I finally get an opportunity to study at the best structured and presented course ever! I had some really frustrating experience of studying in the teaching courses, which in fact didn't add anything to my teaching skills and they didn't motivate me to continue my development as a teacher. This course had a strong impact on my attitude towards this profession. And especially I would like to highlight the inspired style of presentation and a tremendous performance of Dr. Shane Dixon. Thank you very much for your contagious zest towards the profession!
I found this an interesting course. I've been a language student myself for a number of years and very much this has taught me that knowing how to speak English and knowing how to teach English are two very different things. This has been a great "taster" to see whether teaching English to speakers of other languages could be something I am interested in pursuing professionally. I was initially a little scared regarding the peer review assignments, however I think this is a valuable way to consider aspects of an issue that I did not consider myself. Lastly, I also wonder if this course will help me become a better student myself - a definite unexpected benefit!
This is a wonderful course that is clearly presented to help people who might already work as English Language Acquisition teachers or who are new to the field. Information is clearly presented through videos with supporting documents, as needed. There are regular checkpoints, peer-reviewed writing assignments that involve critically analyzing various teaching ideas, and quizzes that directly mirror any notes you have been taking from the course videos. The professors are fantastic and set a perfect tone for English Language Acquisition teachers to model. I was able to complete the first course in under a week and have moved on to the others in the series!
I liked this course a lot.  Dr. Shane does a great job of breaking down concepts with metaphors and stories from his own life as well as essays from his students.  You can tell he genuinely loves teaching and his personality comes out in these lectures.  He addresses not only how to teach effectively, but takes time to talk about you (the teacher), and the importance of a good work life balance.  If I have one criticism of the course, it is that the weekly Essential Questions (mini essays or video responses) are graded on extremely loose criterion.  However I understand that not everyone who takes this course is a native speaker.   Thank you Coursera!
Really hands on course with great  and unforgettable metaphors. Help to struct a picture of being a good teacher by introducing fundamental but crucial rules, e.g.being a camera to  provide both focus mode and diffuse mode for learners, so that they can spend time in words and grammar while practicing what's being learnt in outside world. Taking learners' sentimental factors seriously to help build confidence etc.Most of the time, we were only thinking about what to teach. With theories in this course, we got our own diffuse mode of teaching how to teach (how to stimulate) and how to teach them to be good with language learning strategies (LLS).
This is a wonderful and friendly course that, at any moment, seems relatively easy yet conveys a smart and sensible pedagogy to help students acquire a language. Each week's coursework lays out a simple metaphor, yet that chain of ideas leads to some very sensible ideas like how one shouldn't feed English to students the way one feeds corn to geese for paté, but, rather, that students should be motivated to teach themselves by immersing themselves in language communities. So this course was a lot of fun, yet in only a few weeks I've learned more about pedagogy than I did on a five-year English-teaching trip around the world.
I have never enjoyed a course as much as I am this course!  I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to learn from professors that are so passionate about this field.  I was expecting your typical college course where it's boring and non inclusive.  This is seriously the best experience and I am having the time of my life!  I've never felt so involved and inspired by a college course.  This is not a passing feeling. It's taking root within me and something I will carry with me as I continue on my journey.  Thank you so much for this course and....just the opportunity to be exposed to such amazing Drs./Professors!
I learnt a lot of things from This Course, It was very useful for me, Thanks to everyone who participated in preparing and presenting this course.I'm grateful for everything that I learnt in this amazing course, no matter how hard I try to say how am I very thankful for everyone of you it won't be enough to describe how I feel, So thank you so much.Special Thanks to Dr. Dixson you are the best teacher I ever have and I wish one day I could attend a live lecture with you, I learnt a lot from you and from first lesson to the last one of this course, there's a huge difference in my level as a teacher :) thank You
First of all, I would like to express my full gratitude to the professors who made this course. It was very insightful and interesting. I would recommend it to everyone who is willing to expand his or her knowledge about the profession of teaching a English. Second, I want to thank all of my classmates who helped me with a lot of ideas and didn't hesistate to share everything they know. Also, for reviewing my assignments. Finally, I want to say that I am very happy for completing this course, and I can't wait to complete the other courses related to the specialization of teaching English. Thank you!
Teach English Now is filled with a lot of needful contents and techniques for better language learning acquisition. And lessons under it are not, at all, limited to teaching language alone; it extends to every aspect of teaching subjects. It exposes a teacher to better strategies for teaching , that would make students feel engaged and interesting about the contents. With adequate understanding of this course, teachers can produce confident and competent graduates who are as proficient at speaking, writing, reading and listening as native English speakers. I was fortunate to have taken this course.
I love the course and it is so useful. The Lecturers are so wonderful even thougth all the lessons are on the video but I really can feel their efforts to make the course more approachable and easier to catch up. The principles and techniques introduced about language learning are really pratical and scientific.Besides, reading other learners' assignment is also beneficial to me!Love it soooooooo much!I will keep on learning as soon as I've got spare time! Hope I can get the final certificate! Thank you all who have made contribution to making this course! You guys are just awesome!
Thank you very much for this course! It was very useful and interesting! I've already started to implement all the knowledge I got here and I feel that my lessons became better and the students' result became higher as well! I am going to pass all the courses and capstones because the more we do something the easier it becomes! Now I am an undergraduate student; however, in future I am planning to obtain my Master's Degree in the USA. So, if I succeed, I will definitely try to meet all the team of the course, because you are awesome professionals!All the best to you!
Was quite useful in setting the ground for the teachers to take a deeper look into the theoretical foundations of language teaching and their practical applications. The course infact gave insights into how teachers should handle their classes as well as  to what extent to shoulder their responsibilities as teachers.In fact, I was a bit surprised when the Dixon advised not to assume too much responsibilities, but then got to understand how doing that affects teachers in the long run, and results in burn outs. Thanks to the instructors of the course.
This was a very interesting module, other than giving out imporant information to question ourselves as language teacher it encouraged us to think again and review how is it that we are really performing as teachers, are we asking the right questions? are we thinking of the best ways to enroll our students on leargning languages? are we wnjoying our labour? All of the lessons provided not only gave information to improve our classes but gave us the opportunity to wonder what can we do better and how can we be better as teachers.Thank you!
Teach English Now! Foundational Principles is a great informative course.  The self-paced style allowed time to focus on content where I needed to gain more skills.  The instructors are pleasant and enjoyable to watch.  The readings are fun and interesting.  The constructive feedback I received from my classmates has improved my writing skills.  The required reviews prepared me for grading students' work in the classroom setting.  I highly recommend this course to anyone considering the ESL / TEFL / TESOL Teaching profession.
Course is fun, easy, enjoyable and beneficial. Prof. Shane is a very talented presenter and managed to pull me into the lectures. My only concerns are: The length of the course was too short and it was not very deep. In other words In my opinion they could have easily added another course worth of material to this course without it becoming overbearing. It made me feel that their stretching the number of courses you have to take to finish the specialization. Other wise its a good course. Great instructor and good content!
This course is just awesome. It will be very helpful to the ones who are at the beginning of the profession. The topics covered solutions for many of my struggles about teaching ways, the importance of practice, how to manage time in class, understanding my students' views etc. It also improved my analyzing skills with the assessment questions which were really food for thought.  The best thing is all lessons are explained in a very simple way. I am very grateful to all Arizona University and Coursera team. Thank you!!!
I have learned a lot of interesting knowledge from this Foundation Principles course. Sometimes you seem to know it a lot but when you update you will see what you know is only the top of the iceberg. Everything need to be acquired with good instructors. Thank for the course's beloved teachers, I burn lightly with my teaching job again. I recommend this course for all teachers of language. If they feel bored with teaching, want to leave your profession, this will help them to find best themselves and core value again.
This was an excellent course! I love how everything is taught in the form of metaphors. I particularly liked the simplicity of the course and the way it was presented in the form of short modules. I loved Shane Dixon's way of talking and his expressions made the course a lot of fun. I enjoyed all the assignment questions as they really helped me apply everything I learnt through each module. I will definitely recommend this course, and hope to move to the next level with it. Thank you for such an amazing experience!
Outstanding! I love the enthusiasm Dr. Dixon brings to this MOOC. This course is taught by people who really understand how to teach at the most basic level, which has made taking this course so informative. Not only did I learn the foundational principles of EFL instruction, but simply watching HOW this whole course was setup, executed, and designed has been a learning experience in and of itself. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is or is thinking of teaching English as a foreign language.
Thanks, this course is an evidence of the advantages of a mooc and a good use of the technology, i learned a lot and i'll keep in mind all your advice. I want to go through all the courses of the specialization, even though i  don't have the $$ to purchase for the courses certification, the important thing is that i'm learning a lot and my future first students will be the real certification and rectification of what i have leaned, giving my best self to teach them. Teachers. You are awesome. thanks
I enjoyed the video lessons. I found the system of rating my classmates and my classmates rating me an interesting and stimulating activity.  It was interesting to read other peoples' opinions, rate them and give feedback. I became aware that my feedback improved and was more constructive over the duration of the course and I hope that it was a bit helpful to the classmates that I rated. It gave me a sense of practicing something that will be part of what I do when teaching a language. Although, .
The course combines theory with practice in an organized and effective way. After a quick and understandable information about the teaching principles, course teachers really illustrate how we can apply these theoratical information into our classroom environment. The course also handles every aspect of teaching process: Methodologies, Learning Strategies, Students Autonomy and even Teacher Burnout. Really useful course for all language teachers. Thank You Coursera and Arizona State University.
It is a recommended course for any teachers out there. Even though this course is focusing on teaching English language, I find that it is still helpful for teachers of any other subjects, even other languages! I thoroughly enjoy weekly assignment even though I have to admit that I didn't complete some by the end of the week. But, it is all on me because I am responsible for my own learning. Good luck to everyone who is taking this course and anyone who will be taking this course! Cheers!
The Foundational Principles portion of this specialization is really comprehensive, but also not complex enough that a new learner can't complete and understand the material. There is a strong focus on teacher technique that I appreciated. There is a good combination of audio-visual material and reading material. I prefer to learn through reading so it was nice to intersperse articles and authentic research with the lessons. Would definitely recommend this to new and seasoned learners!
It was an amazing experience! I must commend Dr. Shane Dixon's level of creativity in making the course interesting and very easy to comprehend. His ability to explain the most complex ideas in simple forms is quite incredible. I never thought that taking an online course will be so rewarding and educative, my experience has cleared all my doubts. I also appreciate Coursera's efforts in putting this wonderful courses together, and I look forward to taking my courses on this platform.
Although it was an introductory course, the foundational principles were very helpful, even as an experienced teacher.  Because I did not have any formal training in education (i.e. did not major in the education field), the principles taught offered a lot of insights into why I have been doing what I did in the classroom and why I was trained in particular ways of teaching.  This is a great course to start the TESOL certification process or to see if this is what you really want.
The course was very useful and gave me a lot of ideas that I didn't know as a future teacher and also it gave me the opportunity to discover more about the teaching field making it seem like an exciting journey to take. The tutors were very spontaneous and not strick at all, they are friendly and have a smooth message delivery way that the student understands what they are talking about immediatly. I really enjoyed the course and looking forward seeing you in real life. Thank you
Having both taken Barbara Oakley's coursera course about learning as well as reading her book, I was already familiar with the ideas about focused and diffuse learning modes.  This course applied not only that information that I was aware (and quite fond) of to the idea of language learning, but also pulled in a number of other useful pedagogical resources and presented them in a coherent and cohesive manner.  I am looking forward to the next course in the TOEFL specialization.
I gave a 5 starts rate because i really like the way you presented the part 1: materials and videos was so precisely ant not too long, that study was not feel like taking a course but reviewing things that we may be achieved a long time ago but we had forgotten somehow. it has a personal approach to me as a person and as a teacher, in order to never forget how ridiculous we have to be while teaching to help our students to feel really comfy with their learning process. Thanks,
I loved and enjoyed the teaching style of this course. It modeled the way I should be teaching perfectly and so I was able to connect the content I was learning to the way the teacher was teaching. Lots of teacher talk and body language and scaffolding was modeled. I also learned very useful information which I look forward in using in my own classes in the future. All in all, spectacular. Keep it up and I hope those who come after me will enjoy it just as much.And thank you!
Thank you for this help on teacher/student relations; sharing the importance of practice, helping students feel smart, relating teaching experiences to others, and stressing how hard it is to perform something new.  This class has helped me with my teaching practice, to make certain my classroom is more of a co-op with students.  Dr. Dixon is so engaging as a teacher and mentor, I'm now going to search for his books to further learn his techniques to help develop mine.
I love teaching. But sometimes I feel that my students do not want to learn English. And I always ask myself: "Why  are they lazy? Why aren't they doing anything?" And I found the answer. Because I did not give them enough chance to practise. Almost all of my lessons were organized by lecturing. I used to teach only grammar rules. I can't remember using body language during my lessons. After taking part in this course I learned many things.  Thank you all very much!!!
I absolutely loved this course. It was fun and with a great structure. I learned a lot easily and it was so fun I didn't wanted it to finish. Time passes so quickly with Teach English Now. I want to thank Dr. Dixon for his wonderful teaching and all the Teach English Now team for making this amazing course. I also want to thank Coursera team for letting me take this course and giving me this wonderful opportunity.I don't know how to thank you enough.Thanks a lotMaryam
The videos are very well done and the course material was a good start to learning Teaching English as a Second Language theory and foundations.  There is some delays in waiting for peer reviews and to be able to review others work which can affect your timeline and goals, and peer reviews can be unfair and there seems to be no recourse to challenge them, but the assignments are simple and you can just re-do them and get different peers to grade you which worked fine.
This course is essential for anyone who wants to be a language teacher. I have taken an online advance TESOL certificate but  unlike it, TEACH ENGLISH NOW! Foundation Principles course is what I needed: the video lectures, the readings were all presented clearly and the tasks are reasonable.  It's refreshing for those who have been teaching English for a long time who might be thinking of giving up or who might be very tired by now, this course is just  invigorating !
I knew this course would be great and worth it, what I did not expect was to be wowed. The modules are sooo rich, so easy to comprehend and very applicable to everyday life.  I'm not a teacher yet but I'm already applying these principles. I have a nephew who is having troubles learning a second language and I found myself giving him tips from what I learned here. I can't wait to begin the rest of the courses.  A big thank you to the instructors. Thanks you!
It's very useful though theoretical course,there are many advice how to teach; methods,approuches and devices.It's a ineresting view with metaphors and psychological articals,learning strategies and recommendation how to keep professional without burning out but being bright candle with appealing fire .Not only burning to teach but ignite this fire in your students! I appreciate for this course and I hope it will be better and interesting in further parts.
ASU has done a great job of putting together materials to present the ideas needed to teach English as a second language. It's far and away the most well organized and presented class I've taken through Coursera. I am auditing the class so I can't speak to the response times and response quality of the instructors but the forums seem active and I did get responses to my questions within a week. I look forward to enrolling for the certificate next year.
This is a great course. I taught for 20 years in schools of Medicine without any instruction on how to teach. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities of teaching language in multiple ways. The presentations are clear and concise and easily understood. The combination of videos and written information makes for an excellent teaching strategy. Finally, I really enjoyed taking the course and learning so much more about how to teach languages.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course.  The content was well presented and the videos were very interesting and appropriate lengths. As a result, I was able to easily follow and retain the information and visualize how I will apply some of the new techniques I have learned.  The peer assignments were thought provoking and it was beneficial to see what my peers in the class had to say.  Thank you to all of the teachers, peers and wider production team.
Really great course to start my TOEFL journey. I have been out of college for over twenty years and this was a great way to get back into further learning. The content was interesting without being overwhelming and was presented in a simple way. Dr.Shane Dixon has great energy and is able to make the concepts relevant but also inspiring. In addition, I really enjoyed getting to interact with other learners as we reviewed each other’s submissions.
The course is excellent! In fact, the professor, Dr. Shane Dixon is an expert able to capture and keep our attention.More yet, the content and the approach used are really good! The way Dr. Shane conduct the course and explain how to become a better teacher make this course a must for future teachers.I highly recommend, not just for english teachers, but those who wants to improve their abilities as professors at colleges and universities.
I found the course particularly exceptional and exciting as the things that were taught and how they were taught, was the first of its kind in my experience of traditional learning. I believe second language is one of the most difficult things to teach. Our teachers in the course, by way of teaching the modules taught us techniques of HOW language should be taught. I'm looking forward to learning more from them in the following courses.
This course is amazing, I've got a lot of new useful information in really concentrated form and it didn't take a lot of time. In my school and university there was a huge amount of useless information, and it was very hard to isolate important parts from the whole, and in this Coursera course I see absolutely opposite situation. Everything I read and saw in this course will be useful in my further work.Thank you.Kindest regards, Alex
First of all, thank you so much for empowering me and building me up through so many interesting lessons and reading materials. it is very helpful and it is absolutely one of the best courses. I'm so grateful for the professors and teachers who taught this course and prepared this course for us on behalf of the teachers all over the world. I am willing to use methods I have learnt from this course to my students at GMIT, Mongolia:-)
Oh my goodness! I can't say enough about how great this course was for me. Dr. Shane Dixon did an excellent job of sharing the concepts in ways that were easily digested (more cake please). The course was set up better than any course I've taken online. The use of the metaphors truly helped me to easily recall what the class was about and I believe it will always be part of my teaching future. Thank you all for such a great course.
I am Sri Nidhi and I am from India. I am very happy with the course and the instructors - Dr. Shane and his partner. I am very new to the teaching profession and to be frank, I never gave a thought about the principles that I have been using since my first day in teaching language. I am so glad that I came across this course and definitely this course already started making difference in my  performace in all zones. Much obliged !
I highly recommend this course! It highlights teaching techniques language educators can use to ensure successful language teaching and learning in their classroom. Moreover, the modules are interesting and easy to understand. Every language teachers, novice and seasoned alike,  must take this course. Kudos to Dr. Shane Dixon, Dr. Justin Shewell, Ms. Andrea Haraway from Arizona State University for such a wonderful online course!
I really liked the casual yet professional set up of this course. Being a teacher coach in my private life, I understand ALL the information was good. I especially liked the part on Teacher Burnout (it's my specialty niche with mentoring teachers.)  I understand WHY you put in as a module.  I get that YOU GET IT!!! and thank you for your contribution.  If you need any help or more testimonials I am available.  www.iamkendria.com
Amazing teachers, valuable information and top-quality materials! Thanks so much for making this course - I gained a lot from it, especially from giving and receiving feedback from fellow students. The only thing I didn't enjoy much are some questions in the tests because sometimes they seem a bit irrelevant. I would recommend making the tests a bit more to the point and reducing the amount of questions:) Thanks for your work!!!
I want to say a huge thank you to Dr. Shane for making this course so fun and engaging. Also thanks to everyone else involved who put in endless hours to put this amazing course together - if I ever had any doubts about teaching, you certainly reassured me what a fantastic profession this is. My step father completed Tesol a few years back and tells me it was nothing like this and that I'm very lucky to have found this course!
Taking
this course, as a trainee teacher, I feel that more confident than ever before. Besides,
based on the gained knowledge from the course, I have started writing about Teaching
English in my local language Bangla using contextual references. I post them on
my social media account, and I am receiving positive feedback. Many of the readers
have even expressed their interest to pursue Professional TESOL certification.
I enjoyed the lessons. The class was pretty good I actually think I have learned a lot from this class. This was my first online class and I thought your homework and tests really made me think critically  and search for the answers making me learn more  especially peer assessments. And through watching videos i have learned how i can speak confidently while making my point clear e.t.c. Great thanks to my teachers.
Starting this course, I was so hopeful and optimistic about all the things I needed to learn about foundational principles of teaching, and to be honest, I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed every second of the videos and every word of the readings. took many notes and wrote many comments. met great ideas from different people.It was an amazing experience. Thanks you Coursera and thanks you Arizona State University.
I learned a lot about the theories behind language acquisition from Krashen. Dr. Dixon enthusiastically explains the concepts fo "teacher talk", "elaboration" and more, in the context of teaching languages.The course checkpoints aren't tedious like in other courses, they just check for the essential parts and the elaborations are left for assumptions about language learning explained in videos as assignments.
This course has given me new insights into teaching English effectively to non-native speakers. The theories have widened my understanding of the concerns, issues and trends in teaching English to foreign students. In addition to that, the Dr. Dixon and Dr. Haraway are very engaging with their delivery of the lessons. I have enjoyed every moment that I have spent for this online course. Well done, Coursera!
This course was by far the most engaging introduction to teaching ESL that I’ve ever come across. The structure (short lectures interspersed with assessments) meant that information was provided at the optimal level or ‘sweet spot’, and Dr Dixon’s humorous anecdotes made the course fun. The two aspects motivated me to complete the course - in flying colours to boot! I can’t wait to start the next subject!
thanks to all teachers and students i am so happy to being here with you. this course help me to see my skills level and teach me to how can i improve them. i am a students of English language teaching and i am the one of the future teacher with this course i will be a good teacher and i will guide my students according to what i learned here. it is very useful for future teachers. thanks for everything.
Excellent course framework, and presentation. The content is of superior quality, and in par with what one will learn in the brick and mortar TESOL schools. I have also received interesting feedbacks from my course mates, and they have been all timely, constructive and pertinent. It goes without saying that the lecturers are highly intelligible and competent in the matter of presentation and language.
Excellent!! A wonderful TESOL course for any one who dreams of becoming a great teacher someday!! It grasped my attention since the very first moment I started watching the first lesson. All the classes by Dr. Shane Dixon are quite interesting and enriched with a lot of pedagogical tips to teach better English language. Congratulations for ASU university and all the team behind this amazing course!!
This course was really good for knowing basic techniques used for teaching!! I loved the teachers, they were all very nice and willing to answer questions on the Discussion Forums. The videos are really useful for explaining the topics and I found them to be entertaining with the use of metaphors and anecdotes. Overall, its a good course if you're looking for knowing the basis to be a good teacher.
I was glad to have an opportunity to enrol in this course and it gave me a truly important experience and useful knowledge. It was rather interesting and exciting to work on peer-graded assignments and I would be glad to continue working hard on my road through TESOL certification from Arizona State University. Let me express sincere gratitude for your work on this course. Let’s keep going!
Amei o curso! Mesmo sendo um curso online, me senti muito próxima dos professores. A metodologia usada foi incrível, trazendo metáforas para nos ensinar técnicas para sala de aula. Simplesmente maravilhoso! Acredito que poderia ter mais atividades para praticarmos o que aprendemos, porque eu sou uma pessoa que para gravar preciso praticar, então senti falta de um pouco mais de exercícios.
Shane Dixon is a little over the top, but it's clear that his energy and enthusiasm is backed up by his knowledge (also it makes sense that he would have such a personality considering the need for it in his ESL classrooms). Everything he says is directed towards helping you understand how to apply what you are learning in a class. Easily the most interesting online course I've taken.
It has been a truly enriching experience to participate and complete Course 1 of Teach English Now! Foundational Principles because it allowed me to relearn concepts I studied some time ago, read about new ideas for ESL, and connect with classmates from all over the world. Also, the professors behind the course are pretty competitive and knowledgeable about this field.Thank you!
This course is great! It has really got me excited about teaching English in China. All the concepts are explained clearly and with metaphors that make you think a bit deeper than you might have otherwise. And if you do all the courses in their Teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) series (8 in total), you earn yourself a coveted TESOL certificate! Good luck!
This course is fantastic because it opened my mind on how to teach my students English in the best possible way. I found each week motivating and the teachers surprised me with the taxonomy presented at the end of the course. It was emotional and tears came out of my eyes. I learned a lot and I will pass on all this knowledge to my students. Thank you very much from the heart.
I looked forward to each week's newly posted lectures and other content. This is a well-organized course, and one learns the various principles, including the more technical, without much effort. Also, Dr. Shane Dixon is a gifted teacher: his success at teaching this class proves that the teaching methods he presents yields successful learning indeed. A recommended course!
The class is definitely what it claims - an overview of foundational principles. I have a degree in education, so it was a bit tedious going through all the things I learned freshman year of college, but the class would be excellent for someone new to the field. The videos are cheesy, but don't waste too much time, and the quizzes/peer reviewed assignments are reasonable.
This course allows us to visualize how important it is to teach, allowing students not only to receive knowledge, but also experiences that will help them to face their future with the best attitude, practicing good principles, with values that give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to model with passion and motivation for their own development and future.
I have an English language at the elementary level, despite studying it at school and university. Therefore, for me this course is the best stage and the most productive period of learning English. Every video, every text, every task of this course has become just incredible for me. Cool, thanks to the organizers of this course who were able to make it concise and useful
Great foundation to teaching indeed. Thanks. As warm language and the tilt of warm language and metaphors was greatly explored to make content sticky in our brains. Great job, as MuD worked out. Language is like a cake, a camera, basketball,a door, the students are young birds, , teacher a couch, a candle and so more. Keep the light (students) remain ignited. Thanks alot
This entire course was entertaining, engaging, and well-structured. I obtained new skills and learned the history of skills I currently use. Each week's theme made the information imparted easy to incorporate into everyday life as well as the classroom. I feel like I have a solid foundation upon which to build further education upon and I look forward to the next course.
I find pleasure in doing the course. Tutoring is very impressive. Felt as if the mentors were next to me and guiding the concepts in a more understanding way.  Very comfortable. Excellent learning. No boring at all. Fun in learning as notice evergreen smile on mentors' face which makes me no deviation from the course. It's a real edutainment. Thank you for your efforts.
I have enjoyed the most of the presentation of Shane Dixon! Other teachers are also very good indeed, i really appreciate, but this fellow is very close to my pedagogical philosophy and really touched me, my general values in life. I want to thank everyone who worked on such great smart project!!My sincere love and respect for you guys, Baktygul Baikozha from Kazakhstan
Although it just the firs instalment in this TESOL specialisation, this course is enough by itself to revise, improve, and maybe totally change your understanding of what it means to be an English teacher and actually teach with passion and success. I do recommend this course without reservation for Dr Shane and his team really know how to prepare and serve their cake!
This is an excellent course. It helped me a lot by teaching me a lot of basic principles about teaching that I didn't know. I think that the information given in this course is key to understand the role of a teacher and stay motivated, so we can help students learn and develop the best they can. I'm completely satisfied with this course and I recommend it 100 percent.
¡¡Maravilloso!! Este primer curso es inspirador, enérgico y sus contenidos están muy bien organizados. Siento que he aprendido muchísimo. Ningún otro curso de los que tomado, me había pedido reflexionar como lo ha hecho este curso. Es más que teoría, es introspección, es detalle, es también, una instancia de auto-revisión profesional. Gran curso, grandes profesores.
This course was beautifully made, the content was rich and meaty and yet not overwhelming. The modules were compact and yet well paced,  presented using the very same principles being taught. My children (ages 8,10, 12)  would even sit down and watch Dr. Shane's lessons with me, every week! Thank you very much to the team behind the Teach English Now specialization.
I've "taught" both kids and seniors informally before (swimming lessons, writing, computer classes) and this course helped put in clear perspective the things I'd learned by trial and error. Wish I'd known some of this stuff back then. It was pretty easy and broken down into tiny bits, and while it's a 6-week course, you can very easily do it in a week, like I did.
The course is very well thought out to provide the basic concepts and principles of teaching. These concepts are logical and easily understood. However, I was able to easily understand these concepts because of the well-thought out organisation of the course. The pace of the course is also suited for those who can make time on the side in their busy schedule.
The course was very educational from beginning until the end.  Using all kind of metaphors thru the entire course was really an eyeopener. Thumbs ups to the team Arizona State University who developed this training program.  Good luck with sharing this inspirational teaching technique in the future.  Allan de la Cerna Enriquez from Terneuzen, The Netherlands.
I love it. I learned a lot and I specially like the fact that the presenters are very empathetic to teachers. I appreciated the last module personally too since it caters a topic that not all courses offer. More than information is emotional stability of teachers so I love it when they talked about teacher's burn out. I am looking forward to the next course!
This course was really very important, I consider it is aperfect tool for all the teachers who need a new information about how to teach a new language in the modernworld.It shows the tecniques, estrategies and how to use the technology not just for student as the teachers too.For me was like a new breath necesary in the way of teaching english.THANKS A LOT
A very significant course for all ESL teachers, even if you have many years of teaching experience it really shed the light on core concepts that you may have forgetten. I really enjoy taking this course; it has ignited mine motivation and has awaken me to try new ways and techniques in my career, thanks to the wonderful instructions provided by Dr. Shane.
This course is proof that online learning can be an effective tool when used and done correctly! I absolutely loved being part of it and I appreciate the effort the teachers put into producing such good modules. I was interested in the idea of learning how to teach English before I started this course, and now after finishing I can't wait to learn more.
Hello to the wonderful teachers of the course.I enjoyed each segment and each class.I know I learned a lot as I do not have a teaching background.I have a lot of practicing to do but every time I finished a module I was happy to practice again and again on my own and with others around me.Waiting for the second part with a smile on my face :-)Thank you
I am very grateful to Coursera for offering this course to the rest of the world. It opens the opportunity for instructors in the world to improve their teaching skills and become better teachers in their classrooms. Many thanks to the creators for driving the concepts in a fun and interactive way. It was an amazing and enlightening experience. Thanks.
I like the course a lot. It is interesting and it seems very well organized. It is interactive in a way that challenges you to think and express your own opinion about teaching. That helped me gain a better perspective on language teaching and motivated me as a teacher. I do recommend this course. I am having fun while learning - best combination ever!
Las explicaciones son amenas y divertidas, ademas de claras y fáciles de entender. El material se puede relacionar con la practica diaria de enseñanza del idioma en cualquier contexto. Fue una muy grata experiencia que considero útil para profesores con experiencia, recién graduados o para estudiantes de la especialidad de educación en lengua inglesa.
The course is well-developed with useful resources and lively presentations through easily-remembered relevant metaphors. I will always remember the dramatic examples of language is cake, language is like a camera, language is like a coach ( example of Michael Jordan trying to teach basketball merely from a textbook is funny and powerful!) and etc.
I absolutely loved it! This is an amazing course which gives everyone a chance to be great language teacher, as well as a great language learner. I will always see teaching with a new set of eyes after this course. It has certainly changed my life for the better! Thank you to the Coursera community and Arizona State University for this opportunity!
This MOOC is fun-filled and is a good introduction to the world of language teaching. It offers a good solid foundation for prospective teachers to make sense of the process of teaching, classroom dynamics, and sources and theories that could be used in class. It makes use of a lot of metaphors to facilitate this, in humor-filled, simplified ways.
I have learned more techniques on how to have my pupils master their skills. The foundational principles are so helpful in dealing with issues on how to deal on ample time for acquiring the language. And this principles is not only applicable to language but on all the learning areas. I find it great and helpful..More power to all of you.GODSPEED.
This course provides an excellent overview of the principles that any teacher must discover if he/she is to enjoy their work. These principles are transferable and do not deal with the language itself, but rather language learning (and learning in general), so it is a useful course even for those who plan to teach in languages other than English.
I like the short videos! It is a more interesting way of teaching than creating 1,5-hour-long lectures. Short but straightforward. My only problem is that after the third week it became a little bit monotonous because we had to do the same task every week. Despite that, the teachers are great, and I hope I will see them in the next modules, too.
I enjoyed this course very much. As a student I am happy to say that the time and effort I put on this course was very beneficial to me. It is really helpful for me to improve my teaching career. I really appreciate the way the lecturers approach to teach us broad and deep concepts through very simple but meaningful examples. Thank you so much.
This course, which, is the first milestone for a language teacher has given me immense knowledge about the teaching pedagogy to be followed while teaching students and remain control over oneself and that teaching is a lifelong process where we will encounter pandoras secret every time throughout the journey.Thank you for this beautiful course.
A very good introduction to the basics of teaching English to speakers of other languages.I learnt how to engage students from the very first seconds of a lesson .I became aware that students can gauge whether you will be a good teacher or not in just a few seconds.The techniques i learnt have given me confidence to teach in a professional way.
the course was really informative and helpful, especially some theories and studies are 2007 and i just knew about since i graduated in 1995, I think all teachers should do these courses regularly, and we hereby thank Coursera and ASU and all those who make it happen and I will go forward with the second course for sure, wish me Luck. Mustafa.
Hello everyone! I recently completed the first course of the TESOL Specialization and let me tell you, I am beyond delighted. The number of valuable techniques and teachings that I have learned in this course are truly stepping stones to my teaching career in the future. Dr. Shewell is an incredible teacher! Can't wait to learn more from him.
What a wonderful course it was and what a creative way to teach the principles of teaching the instructors used to facilitate understanding. The use of metaphors to explain the principles of teaching was very helpful and effective! I don't think I will ever forget the principles now nor the metaphors! I highly recommend this course!
As this was my very first "course" with Coursera. i enjoyed it! I found it entertaining and very informative as well. I believe it can help a lot!. I didn't complete al the courses because I have many interests and now I am fallin for the freelance remote work so i got to learn about that and hopefuly with Coursera I get to do that!
This course is fantastic, I learned lots and lots of priciples about teaching any language, how to combine between the content and the technique, how to be different always and follow your own passion in teaching the language and be an actor, act silly and make jokes to serve the purpose and make your students acquire the language.
If you're interested in learning virtual instruction, then this is the course for you. The instructors encourage students to record a series of videos (1 to 4 minutes long), but those without a Web cam can also submit text files. Making a fool of yourself is allowed. The instructors provide excellent andragogy. Highly recommended.
I really did enjoy taking this course. The information that I received helped me to implement new ideas and concepts into my language classroom. It also made me stop to think "Why do I teach?" I think looking at your own personal motivation helps you to remember and develop a better strategy to use inside your language classroom.
Thanks  for everything. All teachers around the world haven't same conditions especially advantage for developing themselves . But with this course all of us can have a lot of opportunity for improving and developing ourselves. You can be a teacher more than 20 years but there are lots of new things you can learn in this course.
This is an excellent course as an introduction to language teaching. Loved how the entire course was scaffolded and built upon very important language teaching techniques. I highly recommend this course for those interested in becoming a TESOL Instructor or as a review for teachers who are already teaching. I am very satisfied!!
Consistency is clearly visible in the way the lecture is structured and delivered. Use of Metaphor helped in understanding the terms even better. Peer-graded assignment challenges the learner in bringing out the best in them. Congratulations to the entire team for the effort and wishing them to keep doing in future. Thank you.
Thank you so much for this course! It was a wonderful path! Hope, I'll finish all the courses for TESOL certificate and will communicate with mentors not only as guides in teaching, but with experienced colleguages!  As well as with classmates, it's great that we can create a network of ESL professionals! Thank you, Coursera!
I truly appreciate the comprehensive course . When I discovered this great online course and the convenience of it, I like to learn and teach the English language.I actually had fun taking this course.I especially appreciated the video lectures and written assignments. They helped me prepare for my future teaching endeavors
Great course! I loved every minute of it.  The videos were great and I learned a lot about teaching that I didn't know before, or rather that I might have known but not paid much attention to. The passages and the videos made me more aware of my own teaching techniques and skills, especially where improvement is required.
Comparing this to other TESOL programs, you're going to learn a lot! Watch the videos and do the work, they're only going to add towards your learning experience. What I absolutely like about this is that it really does take an effort to succeed in these courses, unlike the other websites with cheaper options. Thank you!
It's a wonderful course for English teachers and people who want to become an English teacher. This course has a logical and understandable structure, interesting tasks. I've got a lot of interesting and useful information. I can apply the acquired knowledge in my work. It's  sVery inspiring course. I like it very much.
Very enlightening, and easy to follow.  I've taught English to non-English speakers, and wish I'd had a course like this beforehand!  Learned many helpful principles.Was also quite encouraged to learn that (research shows!) that one can learn a new language at any age, provided you use effective acquisition techniques.
Great course! The videos were done in such a way that made the information interesting to learn and easy to grasp. I really enjoyed how Dr. Dixon wasn't afraid to make himself look ridiculous to make meaning clear, as he teaches us to to. I also enjoyed the supplemental literature on the theories we were introduced to.
This was, hands down, the most motivating course I've ever taken! Its
structure was clear, the assumptions made me reflect on many aspects of
language teaching and the videos with the metaphors were simply delighting! I’m
looking forward to start the second one of the series. I recommend it to all
language teachers.
It is an amazing course that will provide a learner different strategies and ways to be a qualified teacher. All the instructors are so friendly in their teaching and use different metaphores to make the  learning more interesting. I learned  a lot of things. This course is really effective for the future teacher.
I found the information presented in a very orderly fashion. The presenters communicated their ideas in a clear and fun fashion.  It was good learning new techniques as well as being affirmed in what I have done in the way of teaching so far. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is teaching language.
Great! Thank you for creating this course. It's just what I needed at a time when I needed it. It's nice to see a high quality, engaging, substantial, fun and sincere TESOL/TEFL course, and I have already learned valuable information that I believe has made me a better instructor. Thank you! You guys are awesome!
I really enjoyed this course. The way Dr. Shane Dixon explained the subject is amazing. I learnt from him just like a child. Secondly, the course content is designed to the needs of English teachers. I would like to thank the course designers and teachers Dr. Shane Dixon, Ms.Jessica Sinco and Dr . Justin Shewell.
Basic but extremely useful - this course help you to get the whole understanding of construction, organizational side of whole chain of 8 courses for Specialization and certificate. Also, it helps me to get used to it, distribute resources carefully. I like it very much, and this course motivates me to continue!
Vry happy to have signed up to this course, I found it to be very complete: I updated concepts I was already familiar with, learned new ones, shared input with other students taking the course, and enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic approach of the teachers. Looking forward to taking other coursework from them.
This course 1, has been extremely useful with crystal clear explanations , making the meaning clearer and fire up the teaching passion to the next level. Thank you COURSERA and also I would like to thank  Dr. Shane Dixon and Madam Andrea Haraway for making our journey stress free with good teaching techniques.
i have finished the first specialization and certainly will continue for the next one , i send you this to express my profound thanks for the the people in charge of this amazing website , as well as to our professor Mr DIXON , a special thanks also to my colleagues for their reviews and precious advices.
I found this class challenging but certainly, with a bit of study and note-taking it was possible to get an excellent grade, and indeed to learn well.I loved Dr. Dixon's lecturing style. He always models exactly the principles we are learning. I can't say how much I enjoyed the class. Highly recommended
I have taken a TEFL course previously and can confidently say that this course has taught me so much more in just the foundational principles. The teachers are engaging and have created thoughtful material. I have enjoyed all the lessons learned so far and look forward to the second part of the course.
One of the most complete and interesting courses that I have taken in all my life, it gives you a different perspective of everything, not only in teaching English, and also it makes you reflect about your whole school background as teachers, students and remember those memorable experiences you have.
This course is everything that I needed to start my journey as a teacher!Dr. Nixon is easy to understand, funny, and his sincerity reads through in each video :-)Thank you for offering this course! I feel more confident and prepared to continue studying and taking my TEFL now having taking this class.
It was a good introduction to foundational principles of English teaching. Definitely the other courses in the certification need to be taken in order to get the full benefit of the information given. It really is meant to be a jumping off point to learn and implement other more teaching techniques.
Just the beginning now but a really great one !Love the content, the teachers videos are really well made and explanatory.I found the Coursera platform really well fabricated and intuitive.Everything is set to give us the best chances to thoroughly learn and earn that awesome life changing license !
Realmente un valioso recurso donde se presentan alternativas pedagógicas para alentarnos a la aventura de enseñar ingles, disfruté cada uno de los vídeos y me parece genial la forma como los instructores dan sus explicaciones en cada tópico. Recomiendo 100% este curso para nuevos participantes...
Dr. Shane Dixon explained the materials really well. It really stick in my mind and I can remember all of it easily. I really hope that later, when I become a teacher I can be just like him. I can present the materials in a fun and engaging way and in an easy way where student can understand it.
A perfect guide for beginners. Gives a brief outline on the various aspects of teaching a language and explains how to begin and guides us in developing our own teaching philosophy. The assignments encourages critical thinking and helps us understand the principles and crux of teaching English.
As an English teacher, I would recommend this course to each person who is interested in making impact in the lives of your ESL students by going deeper pedagogy of ESL teaching. I learnt the practical aspects of many pedagogical concepts. Our instructor, Dr. Shane Dixon is an amazing teacher.
That's amazing! When I was about to leave my current teaching position, get TESOL certificate and go abroad looking for a better job - I had no idea how motivating this course could be! Now I will estimate not the salary I can receive in the future, but the skills I should acquire before that.
My first Teach English Now! certificate ever. Teacher Shane Dixon is so humorous and erudite. The provided knowledge is well-organized and useful. This course is definitely worth my time and effort. I want to send my appreciation and biggest thanks to ASU and Coursera team. Thank you so much!
This was a wonderful course which far exceeded my expectations.  I actually looked forward to each lesson, and I am motivated to continue on to get my TESOL certificate through Teach English Now.  Dr. Dixon and team definitely practiced what they preached by  keeping it fresh and interesting.
Great content, effective delivery and thought provoking essay questions. Bear in mind that you get out of the course what you put in. Ensure to use the assignments as reflections of the modules which you can go back to during your teaching careers and use as forms of professional development.
Hello friends. I just started my learning after a nice gap of years and i thought to give it a try and i am happy to say that i could do it as the course is not that tough and very understandable and more over you get to read so many reviews. I really enjoyed completing the course. Thankyou.
The material was presented in an inspirational, easy-to-understand manner, with great metaphors to help one remember the lesson.  I really enjoyed the teaching example that used Haru's story, it was inspirational, and it was nice to see a small part of how teaching works in the classroom.
It's my pleasure and honor to enroll for your course. My feeling now is ineffable when I received such a certification from an elite tertiary educational institution. On the top of my gratitude to Dr.Shane Dixon and his team for his indefatigable effort to design such a consummate course.
This is a very helpful course. I had already gotten a TESOL certificate, but this one taught things that the other course I studied didn't. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about teaching or is new to the whole concept!
It is indeed a very useful and motivating course not for just beginners for all those who wish to a language teacher. I personally got fully benefited in terms of new knowledge, core concepts of learning and skills. I would like to take on more such courses to enhance my competencies.
i really enjoy this course because the two instructors use active body languages and changeable tones and expressions to deliver, which makes this course interesting, and perfectly coherent with what they are teaching!_how to teach English. thank you all for this wonderful course!!!!1
I LOVED this course! Everything was so clear and I enjoyed watching lectures and doing tasks. Thanks to all people who created this course, I've never been so satisfited with studying. After this course I feel totally confident that I can use techniques in real life. THANKS YOU A LOT!
I've learnt a lot thus far and it has transformed my entire preconception about teaching English language. Indeed "langauge is like cake" and not "anyone who speaks the language can teach the language". Thanks to you my Amazingly super great tutors. So glad to be part of your class!!!
The course was really amazing, I loved the didatic of the course, all the metaphors from Dr. Shane helped me a lot . The disign of the course was clean and easy to undertand and the quality of the videos simply perfect.I will suggest all my friends that are teachers to do the course.
The course is very well structured. Wonderfully modulated video lessons transfers the students inside actual classroom and we get a feel of part of Dr Dixon's class.However, I feel some kind of interaction with our mentors throughout the journey will give a new edge to this course.
Thanks to all the professors and Coursera who made it possible for us to learn while being on distance! It is an amazing opportunity and experience! Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge and time!I have enjoyed this course very much! I am looking forward for another one!
Great lectures and lecturers! The reading materials are excellent and directly aimed to improve teaching skills. Every lesson comes along with tasks which were carefully designed in order to encourage critical thinking as well as professional growth.  It exceeds my expectations!
trough my time In this course I learned how to use my teaching abilities to help students improve on the way they learn a new foreign language, therefore I recommend this course to anyone who wants to fulfill goals in the teaching career and enhance their skills when teaching.
Truly amazing course. Expecially Dr. Shane Dixon who is an embodiment of what he is teaching throughout the course. I have learned a lot and also enjoyed a lot. Planning to continue with the specialization. Thank you so much, Coursera and Arizona State University! I'm you fan!

I highly recommend this course to anyone thinking about or already teaching English as a second/foreign language. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Thank you to ASU for presenting the course in such an interesting fashion and to Coursera for hosting it entirely online for convenience.
I want to thank Coursera and ASU for putting together this wonderful course. The information was so clear and the videos were very engaging. The tasks were challenging and made me analyze my own views on teaching a language. I am looking forward to starting the next course.
It is an excellent course for all of us who are teachers. It is a simple, punctual, exact and assertive course, with a clear language. I am very satisfied after having completed the first part and I am preparing now to begin the second course of the series.  THANKS !!!!!!!
When I started TESOL course, I didn't quite understand this module. Now, I'm almost at the end of part 2 of this course, and finally, I have a better understanding some this foundational principles. It's a great course for anyone who wants to understand basics of pedagogy.
This course gave a great baseline for getting started in TESOL. I learned as much from watching the professor model good teaching as I did from the content of the videos. I highly recommend this course if you are considering teaching English to speakers of other languages.
Thanks ASU for the Certificate and thanks for the tremendous knowledge they share, I am very delighted to learn a lot from you!I have to admit that you have set a great balance between delievering a lot in even very short video lectures! You did a great job! Many thanks..
all the materials are great and the videos are perfect in the terms of being short and efficient .also the fact that they  build a strong community by nudging you toward upload your assignment and review and give comment to your peers makes this course even more special.
Hi, there. I found this "Teach English Now" course on foundation principles to be great in every way. Not only was it enlighting and, full of information but, it also shows how one can become an effective language teacher. Thank you Shane, and, the rest of your team too.
I REALLY love it! Thank you very much! I've never been a part of an online course; this is my first time, and it will never be the last!I LOVE YOU all! VERY VERY interesting, beneficial, well-prepared ... I love everything you delivered! WOW!I'm very happy I got 99! WOW!
This course is really helpful for teachers and persons who would like to start teaching. From my point of view, the best part of the course is summarizing your new knowledge by writing peer-graded assignments. I really enjoyed the course and hope to do the other parts.
I'm grateful for the financial aid I've received to cover this course. It took me one week to literally wolf all the information down. I love the professors and I love the ideas they share. I can't wait to continue this amazing journey to TESOL certification with ASU!
I like to follow the course in which I learn some methods of language learning that I should apply in my classroom and for me myself. In this course I also learn how to have a sense of control and how to have a fun classroom teaching without being burn out. Thank you.
Great way to introduce us to the joy of Teaching English. It explains many resources to get an idea of how could you do it the right way on Teaching English, tips and advices and the best techniques for learning and acquiring English as a foreign or second language.
Excellent! I enjoyed leaning this course.It helped me to recollect my teaching experiences into the theories taught by my instructors of the Teach English Now; and share experiences of the teachers from the global society of education who participated in the course.
This is a fantastic course! This course teaches you the practical things that you need to know to become a successful ESL teacher. This is a well thought out course, has a very scientific approach towards learning and the teachers are very dedicated and passionate.
I love this course because it is well conceived with lots of didactic strategies. The metaphors are great, but the vivid example of Shane Dixon is enlightening, just as a candle. This course was my anti-depressive pill through a great family problem. Thanks a lot!
I really enjoyed course 1, it was easy to understand and follow! I only wish that I could get my papers scored faster so it shows as complete.... still I can work at my own pace (fast) and earn my certificate so I can get to the good stuff... working as a teacher!
I have watched all the videos and read all the articles in this course carefully and loved the teachings here. Thanks for providing the excellent online program! I believe that this certificate program can help me become a better language teacher and researcher.
I was VERY happy to be a student of this course, because to study for getting TESOL was my long-term dream. I never thought that it will be possible in my life and, especially, in my provincial town.  But with coursera this miracle has happen! Thank you so much!

Shane is such a great teacher. I have learned a lot from him during this module and I can already apply all the techniques in the classroom and also while advising  the teachers of the school I am a assistant coordinator at. Thank you, Shane, Coursera and ASU!
I learned so much. It was more than what i expected. The courses are well organised and informative. I love the videos and the fact that there is a summary at the end of each module. Also, Taking several quizzes help you retain what you learned. I loved it!
an amazing course,I'm an English teacher and I've got a lot of useful teaching ideas I've already  applied some techniques that i took in this course and , teachers in the course have the ability to deliver the information in an easy and a professional way.
I love this course! Great videos and guided metaphors to understand the foundation principles of teaching. I had attended a traditional master course in language teaching, yet it's at ASU Tesol via Coursera I learned and understand the subject content more.
It was without a doubt the best course I ever took! The course was very well prepared and thought out by everyone involved. All the classes are amazing! I am sure it will be a knowledge that I will take into my professional life. I thank everyone involved!
I love the course. It is very easy to understand. Dr Shane Dixon is a great teacher (actor). How he presents the content is very memorable. I wish when I was doing my BA in education I had learnt all this. I am very lucky to have found this useful courses.
I was an ESL teacher about three decades ago and at the time we used a methodology that by today's standards; this course has in fact, explained in a methodical and very professional way the modern process to teach Englsih as a foreign language, great job!
Hello, I felt that everything I knew because I am smart...Nooo, honestly every topic, explanation, and reading material were so clearly not only to answer test questions but also to learn new themes and practice in our daily classes. This course is great!
I have never seen a good online planned lesson like this before.There are many TESOL Platform but this one from ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, through Coursera.com platform ,is the best ever.Everyone with dream of becoming a teacher should attend this program.
It was interesting and fun! I like Dr Shane's presentation method to draw the attention of learners. He articulate and express really well! They kept each lesson short and simple so that we don't lose our interest or focus. Had a really fun time learning!
This course has given me an incredible opportunity to become a better teacher underlining what is a crucial difference between learning and acquisition. It definitely shows the most important principles according to the most effective teaching techniques.
This is an excellent course that inspires thought about who you are (or want to be) as a teacher, fundamental teaching techniques and how your students might feel as language learners. Great metaphors and succinct but helpful videos. I loved this course.
I am glad to take part in this wonderful course and I have learnt new techniques for teaching and got some inspiration for continuing to work in my profession and of course I want to continue studying and want to take part in other parts of this course.
Absolutely amazing course for building the Foundation Principles. The teachers are extremely helpful and teach the course in the most effective and fun way. Arizona State University have taken a great initiative by starting the Teach English Now course.
Getting so much out of these courses.  I usually lose my motivation for on-line learning after the first couple of weeks, or when my schedule starts to get in the way.  But I MAKE time for this course.  Thank you for your creativity and succinct videos.
Thanks to the team for the interesting and useful course. I really enjoyed taking this course, as it is filled with motivation and practical tips. I strongly recommend everyone to take this course, which will help both in learning and teaching English.
This course is full of insight! I like how creative the lessons are presented especially the metaphors...I have so many new insights... and I like it because it's research-based! Thank you very much for an excellent job! I'm so grateful to all of you!
The best course I have ever taken in my life. Because I learned how to learn in English through all years of my life, but no one has taught me how to teach in a proper way and teach in different ways. this course helped me to make my dreams come true.
Very useful and very informative.  I have applied the techniques and other information that is applicable to my students and its outcome is really fantastic!  All the best Arizona State University, I can't thank you enough for giving me financial aid!
I just loved it was so good and effective. I have always loved training or teaching but realized how we can use techniques to do so. I also learned how important it is  to share the work load to avoid burn out. Thanks you so much it was just worth it.
I found the Foundational Principles course to be fun as well as instructive.  I love the writing assignments as they are quite thought provoking.  Having the assignments "peer graded" put me in touch with learners from all over the world...very cool!
This is absolutely a wonderful course, fun and informative. I look forward to each week because I know that I will receive a wealth of valuable instruction, that will serve me so well as a future ESL teacher. I am thrilled to have found this course!
Thank you indeed. I am going through the whole three courses of TEN! for the second time before moving onto Capstone project and still can find new ideas and I am kept motivated. I have learnt more from your courses than in five years at university.
I am very glad of having the opportunity to take this module, Dr. Shane and his colleagues were wonderful. I was very delighted with the explanations and finally I am processing all that information to apply it in future classes.Thank you very much.
Great course. Leaned a lot and have a lot of fun. Enjoy it a lot. Dr. Shane Dixon is truly five star teacher. His performance makes this course easy to learn. All the characters he played make the boring language theories live.  Thank you very much!

I had taken several courses on the basic principles of English language teaching. Foundatioinal Principles made clear a lot of concepts I had only partly understood in the past. I can recommend this course to both novice and experienced teachers.
I highly recommend this amazing course which is part of a four part series for Tesol certificate. It is full of great information and I learnt so much. All the videos and information is so professional and the tutors fantastic. Thank you so much.
While a bit easy (I mean it's an intro and material is peer-reviewed, not graded by professors), it is very informative and captivating. A lot of fun to interact with others and be introduced in an easy way to quite serious and complex material.
All is excelent ! All matherial  help us understand foundation principles for tought in cllass! Thank for this shans AZU! Thank all people who involwed in this process!! Becouse all matherial create for understand and use in real life!Thank you!

Great course content, professors and videos. The tests were also very objective and I liked the fact that there were many of them, as online students we do need lots of feedback and the tests provided that. Thanks, I really enjoyed the course.
I learned so much in a short period of time, but never felt rushed or overwhelmed. Each week had just the right amount of information. I had to work ahead for the last few weeks because of being away for a week in college, but it was doable!

I am so impressed with the quality of style and content that this course was presented.  I could see careful forethought, planning and execution of an online course that was a joy for me to be a part of.  I totally recommend this course!
Although I have taught english to non-english speaking people for many years as a way to earn extra money as I traveled to foreign countries, this course has given me added information and value as I go forward to practice in this field
What I love about this course is that it sets the foundations for reflective teaching while it introduces the topics for language learning and language acquisition. I'm looking forward to continuing with the rest of the specializations.
Through this course I was able to find the mistakes I used to do while teaching. It was even fun learning. The research that was done by the team is appreciable and that has supported us to learn better. Thank You for wonderful course.

I have really like this course . Quite useful for educators . I have come across with new concept which i have  got to know for the very first time and i am going to apply it in my teaching techniques . Thank you so much . - Tabassum
Wow! I was really impressed with the instructors of this course. They are truly experts on this area of specialization. The course really helps me to understand deeply my significant role as a language teacher. Thanks a million, ASU!
I really enjoyed this course. The only thing is that mostly answering essential questions people do "paperwork" I felt like i was the only one doing videos, was hoping to see people expressing their opinions... But sill it was great.
Excellent course! It really surprised me how easy it was to understand all the concepts show, and yet all these concepts are really useful. As someone that loves education, these is a really good introduction into the teaching world.
This is an excellent course. It has been designed accurately for professionals who want to get the ESL  Teaching Certificate. I enjoyed learning about the language foundational principles lectures, theories, teaching techniques, etc.

This is a very useful course as I begin my studies to prepare to teach English abroad.
thanks my teachers.
I learned a lot. This course is definitely recommended to anyone interested in teaching ESL or just learning about the English language. Even with no teaching or any prior experience, this would still be easy enough to understand!
This course was very ueful and insightful. Very early on into the course I realised that this is very useful not only for teaching English but for teaching in general as the skills learnt in this course can be applied to other are
My name is Erik Ramirez from Guatemala. I really enjoyed this fantastic program. I liked the fact that you not only get the theory but also can apply it in your classrooms obtaining great results. I highly recommend this program.
this course helped a lot of principles that will help me be a professional teacher in the near future. moreover, it helped me to put my self in the student shoe, and how to deal with the different problems teachers usually face.
Great course for the present or teachers to be. Valuable both practical and theoretical parts of the course.  A source for a teacher to re-evaluate himself and possibly change or revise his/her approaches to teaching a language.
This is a great introductory course.  It includes a good amount of information that is explained in ways that are easy to understand and remember.  I look forward to continuing this course and earning my certificate.  Thank you!

Very well organized.  Video lectures are clear and build on previous lessons.  It's obvious that this course was developed with the learner very much in mind.  Great way to show teachers (who are their students) how to teach.
It is a great luck and happiness to be educated by Arizona State University's respected and wonderful instructors. It was a great course and I am very happy that I finished it successfully. I am very grateful to instructors.
thanks for such opportunity. I am from Iran and we rarely have a chance to educate in world good universities because of world inequality about Iranian people.  and now i am so happy to take such a course free. thanks again.
Foundational principles are very useful for me. By using these teaching methods, I improve my teaching skills. So I like this course very much and I want to attend educational teaching methods training courses more and more.

Very informative.  Although an introductory course, this program was full of teaching techniques and principals that every prospective and current teacher should acquire and implement in to their own lesson plan and style.
I am very glad that I was able to finish this course. It will definitely help me a lot when teaching English to my learners here in Japan. I aim to acquire the TESOL Certificate so I'll do my very best! Thank you so much!
The People Teaching this course are the best and they have so much life and show  a good interest, they actually teach and they make the course enjoyable and by so doing i was able to pass all my quizzes and assignments.
I enjoyed how they showed examples and explained in detail teaching techniques. I am very excited to continue exploring these tactics and reaching out to students to be able to teach them in the best possible way I can.
A lot of things said in this course are common sense but they are said in a way that helps a teacher find his own teaching philosophy and the best way to approach teaching. It is very good and I definitely recommend it!
This great course gave me a vast host of knowledge on teaching in general that I have ever thought of before. I want to thankfully send my wishes for all members in the team that worked hard to bring this course to us.
I finished my first course with ASU Teach English Now! I am glad I decided to take this course. It really helped me understand the basics of teaching and learn new techniques I can definitely use in my own classroom.
Hello All, I enjoyed this course a lot. I looked forward to the use of metaphors and the stories shared while learning about the fundamentals of teaching English. I look forward to the rest of the courses. Thank you.
I was really helpful to understand what's important to be a good teacher in many ways. I've learned some efficient strategies and gained some great ideas from other resourceful teaches. Thank you for the opportunity.
Great techniques, great videos, great content and great instructors. It was a pleasure to do this course. Thank you Coursea and Arizona State University. And of course, thank you Mr Dixon, Mr Shewell and Mrs Haraway!
I thank everyone so much for developing this specialisation. The courses are well designed and contain information that really improves the techniques and increases the efficiency of teachers. I am learning a lot. :)
This is a great course, easy to understand and provided me the willigness to keep taking the coming courses. I like the peer-reviewed assigment, which allows us to get in contact with people from all over the world.
I'm grateful for this refresher course. It helped me reflect on my teaching journey. Kudos to the teachers who made the lessons fun, interesting, and easy to follow. You inspire me to continue to do my best. Cheers!
I really enjoyed this course. The video lessons were very interesting, and at times quite humorous, which made the content quite clear and easy to understand.  I am highly satisfied with the knowledge that I gained.
The teachers are clear and offer insight into the correct way students should be learning language. The essential questions offer a great way to stimulate critical thought and helps in the digestion of the material.
Although I have read many articles, books, and papers, I learned a lot of new, practical information which has widen my understanding and knowledge of teaching and learning a language.For these, I am very grateful!
Great course! Great instructors! Great teachers and content. I strongly recommend to green horn teachers as well as experienced teachers. Thanks for this course! I will finish this specialization even both parts)))
Thank you for creating the course! It must have cost you a lot of effort and I really appreciate it. Thank you for all the wonderful and shrewd metaphors that helped me visualise certain problems. You are great :-)
It is a great course .Thanks to all the instructors ,but please I have the same problem with my  grading of assignment Peer Review -Week 5.I am still waiting for my grading ,although I completed it all . Hassan Ali
I really enjoyed this course. I have read almost all the contents elsewhere, but the selection was good and I think those who have not taken or studied any language teaching courses would benefit the most from it.
Video presenters did a great job and I only saw one error in all of the text that accompanied the video which is a HUGE improvement over the other courses I recently did which had edit errors in almost every week.
So far, I have finished most of the first of the courses.  I have fully enjoyed it.  The only issue so far is that there are not always enough peer responses to respond to when I am finished and ready  to move on.
A good introductory course for those who had never had anything to do with teaching might be too easy for those who are familiar with teaching in general.  But, for those new to ESL, it is a perfect introduction.
thanks to coursera  for giving a chance to us having TESOL courses and thanks for Arizona State University for sharing amazing content with us. It was a perfect experience to meet with you through online lessons.
Very informational. I really learnt a lot from this course and definitely recommend it to everyone who is teaching. Not necessarily English, but if you teach music, maths, etc... this can be a very useful course.
Great!Thank you for creating such educational platform which is accessible in every part of the world!Another gratitude to the course tutors and creative team! Well done!I feel I am a part of network of teachers!
So remarkable ! This is a great avenue for learning . This has whetted my appetite in teaching English  with foundational principles that would definitely hone my skills as a teacher in person and in profession.
A very helpful and useful and completely support you to start teaching career and contain a lot of effective ideas I would like to thank anyone  participated in this course to provide this extra ordinary service
This was an excellent introduction to pedagogical and practical aspects of teaching English as a second language. Dr. Shane is funny and straight-forward, and the program is well paced and organized. Thank you!
Its a really helpful course, it begins basic but its necessary to review those concepts. They make the work easy, light and specially fun. thank you very much for the material y the special way you transmitted.
The course provides clear and easy to understand foundations of becoming an English instructor.  While some sections could use a little more expanding, it is possible those sections are saved for later classes.
It's  a wonderful journey of learning  through beautiful parks , along the river banks ....We will reach destination without sweating and getting tired on the contrary , enjoying ourselves each and every steps.
It was a great review for what I had learned at CELTA course.  It was a bit too easy for me, but if you are thinking about teaching, it will be a good opportunity to know what teaching is.  Thank you very much!
The teacher is great! One of those that you remember for life. As much as I thought I would feel dragged through the content of this, I am actually really enjoying the content thanks to how good the teacher is.

Utterly useful, inspiring and fully detailed. So very clever to include a module on how to avoid teacher burnout. The i + 1 approach was simply amazing and gave me food for thought. Brilliant
I loved returning each week to the videos, the assignments, and interacting with classmates from around the world.  This class has been one of the very best that I've taken.  On to course #2!
Amazingly applicable, hints and knowledge I got on a course are easy to use and implement. The educators are inspiring and they use the techniques they are teaching so the effects are clear.
It's really well made. I love the graphics and how the main speaker is so engaging. His energy makes me want to learn more. That's the type of environment I'd like to create for my students.

Thanks for the tutors. They also use the technique in the course to teach us. thanks for the feedback from the classmates. I can learn from their point. Great course. I will keep learning.
The only problem is that if no one has kept up with your pace, you are not able to be autonomous in the completion of your studies.  This feature should be waivered if no one is available.
This was an outstanding introduction to teaching English, but as a practicing teacher of a different subject, I found it helpful for teaching any subject. I strongly recommend this course!
This course is more than helpful for any future teacher or teacher who teaches. This course make you realize all those things you still can do to improve your teaching. Highly recommended.

I loved how these foundational principles were taught using a series of metaphors that made the information easy to retain and remember! Interesting and engaging foundational course.
Now, I know what to aim at when learning a new language, as a student. And, what to differentiate in teaching methods, as a teacher. It's such a great kick off in this series by ASU!
An excellent course with the most necessary skills for starting teaching a language. This course helps to scrutinize common assumptions and teach 7 basic language learning paradigms.

Solid, but does not always provide adequate knowledge for future courses. Dramatic visuals instructors use to try to keep students engaged can sometimes be annoying to watch.
It is a very basic course. It is very useful if you are just starting with the TESOL world, but you may want to skipped it if you have some background knowledge in the field.
Excellent foundation course;  particularly helpful was the use of metaphors. The weekly essays were thoughtful statements that encouraged reflection on what had been learned.
Thank you so much our great instructors. It is really a wonderful  important course, I benefit a lot of information from you. You explain the information in a very easy way.
