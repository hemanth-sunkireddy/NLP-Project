This course was ultimately frustrating to take. There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments. Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming  (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses). To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors. The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle. Even from the early week's lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors. For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying "we covered this already." I'm well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person. I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me "your logic is wrong", and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now. Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors. Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again. Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.
I am sure this is a great course for someone who has been exposed to computer programing somehow. I was way ahead of my assignments and watched the lectures at 3X each chapter before getting to my assignments. I got to a roadblock on week 4 and I am unable to move because the assignments have gone from 0-60 without much input. I am able to claim that because many others, who btw seem to be a bit more educated in the matter, experienced difficulties. I understand the moderators can't just give out answers, but they just become robotic in their answers. I am very glad I did not pay for a certificate. Otherwise, I would have wasted both my time and my money. I am out $10 for the book, though. My advice is: don't take this class unless you know "something" about programming.
Teaches neither programming nor MATLAB effectively. Videos are too long and useless for the assignments. Very disappointing. I worked all the way to Week 7 and got 100& on all assignments. Then the lectures and assignments started to come from different worlds and the course became torture (which most people who like programming seem to accept and even enjoy; I don't.)
The videos are good, but have no relationship to the homework problems. There are too many problems per week, and they are very difficult given there are no examples in either the videos or book that cover the material examined in the homework. The entire course was just frustrating.
The instructor is incredibly self-obsessed and just unbearable. All the 'jokes' are neither funny nor useful. Just stick to teaching if you have to.
Boring Professor
Hard.
Course contained unbelievable amount of silly busywork that has no place being implemented in MATLAB, while forbidding  the use of most useful built in functions. At no point during the course was any of  the MATLAB's strengths -- like easy solving of linear systems or vectorized operations, even suggested upon.  Furthermore, the course has unhealthy interest in dates and calendars - again of course disabling all the built in tools.
I don't like it and I don't want to continue with this course how can I unsubscribe without losing my progress in other courses on my account
El curso aunque sea para principiantes, los ejercicios no son claros, yo como persona que inicia en esta Ã¡rea me fue imposible.
It wasn't mentioned that I had to pay for the certificate.I can't afford to purchase the certificate
said i had a free 12 week license, but  i could not get access to the license.
very easy course. was expecting something more challenging.
Matlab license not working, how to complete this course.
not good i cant understant any thing need to inprove
Extremely difficult assignments for the conte
Very lengthy and over knowledge
I didnt feel that intresting.
time pass course
Too many videos with repetitive content. Homework was much more complicated than the information given.
First of all, I am a chemist. I had no idea on how to start programming, therefore I started the course convinced to get some basic skills on Matlab (I had no idea on how Matlab worked) in the beginning I found it really helpful. But then at the end the assignments were really hard and quite difficult to understand for a non-proficient user. I strongly recommend to follow the first part, really helpful, but the second part probably it is more for experts in the field or students in informatic... maybe it can be useful to divide in half parts this online course. Maybe, it can be really helpful to cite the use of polyfit commands to fit functions. Really interesting until the 7th week.
The 'About the course' section is partially true.It was ,in the beginning, felt like being really for the beginners, but nearing the end of the course, the assignments were not anymore for the beginners.Whereas the instructor taught with great effort, the difficulty of the assignments should have been taken into consideration beforehand and examples similar to the tasks should have been included therefore.When the course can be enthralling for someone already have proficiency over other languages, the majority of the beginner would find it near impossible to solve the assignments and achieve the certificate by following ethical coding.
Good videos, the assignments were too heavy for non-used people to these topics (maths etc). I would prefer shorter assignments focused on programming and solving simple conceptually topics though with the use of code gradually getting more difficult.The three stars are given mainly for the videos and the effort to make it comprehensive.  More informative slides would be needed as well. This way people would be able to review key things faster/more efficiently.
the course  instructor was very friendly , very expressive , he made all concepts very clearbut one thing i want to add is that add some videos on explaining some more advanced plotting debugging and file input/output.
I feel like I learned a lot in this course as I was a complete beginner to programming. However, I agree with some of the other reviews that the assignments were way harder than the material presented in the lectures and example problems, particularly for the second half of the course. I felt I had a good grasp on the concepts for the first half of the course, but it got significantly harder. We had to use functions that were never mentioned during the lectures and that I didn't know existed, for example. I found myself getting frustrated and having to consult the discussion boards regularly towards the end, in an attempt to figure out where I was going wrong with my code and even to figure out where to start. That helped, but I believe that the course could be better laid out to better prepare students for the more difficult assignments. That being said, I appreciate the time that the instructors put into making this course and making it available to audit for free. It is a difficult subject for those new to programming and provided a good introductory foundation.
I think the course is a little out of place. The first 7 weeks are for real beginners. It's slow, very slow. But the 8th week and the final assignments are for mid-level programmers. If you're new to computer programming, you probably won't be able to complete the final tasks. I think the course should end in week 7, and the last topics should be added to the next level. But, if you really don't know anything about programming, you can give it a try. If you are already a programmer, it will be a waste of time.
The course itself is good.  Learned a lot but not being able to reset deadlines (not as flexible as I thought) means I am going to lose my certificate.  Not sure if I would try another certificate.  Being a working mother I only have limited time to do so.  Thought this may be feasible but obviously not working as well as I hoped.  The only other issue I found was that the course information doesn't work with all programs so if you are using an older edition then it becomes more difficult to follow sometimes.
This is definitely not a beginner' course to programming. i wish there were more assignments on the basics so the student was more comfortable manipulating vertices and matrices. Truly think this online course could have been divided into two sections.Also, as a math tutor, who is very familiar with word problems and how to determine what is needed and what is given, some of your homework assignments were not very clear.
I think that the course is a great starter for those who want to get familiar with basic programming. There are some problems questions in the assignment which will surely clear the concept and fundamentals of we have learned in the online class. It is great way to get familiar with MATLAB considering the course material is good to begin with.
This course is kind of simple and slow if you have previous programming experience and just want learn some Matlab. The videos are sometimes too detailed, I mean, they explain some simple ideas with multiple examples. Also, the practice problems are not enough. But I think it would be a good course for beginners.
The course was a bit lengthy but constructively designed. Instructor was awesome and he covered everything perfectly. It would have been better if the duration was made smaller and a bit fast paced,as I noticed that after week 4 the contents was a bit too lengthy and slow-paced...
Really Amazing course with lots of good content and well explained classes that teach you the BASICS. Which was a great experience. But the assignments were not appropriate for a "Introduction to programming with MATLAB" Really hard and frustrating, specially the last exercises
Overall the course is good but the assignment questions are at a different level (especially week 8 and 9). If someone previously have some knowldege about the subject then only he/she can solve the assignments ,otherwise it will consume a lot of time.
the course was very good but the last 2 weeks are very very hard and not well declared and i recommend using shorter videos than these with giving hints in the assignments about the functions that have to be used without being mentioned in the videos
Nice video lectures but I wish they were practice problems to do before the assignments.  It was quite a jump and hard transition to go from the videos to the assignments. I found them difficult (I have absolutely zero programming background).
the pace at the beginning by the instructor was quite decent but then it picked up suddenly, the final weeks were tough to understand. but somehow i managed to clear. i m not sure if I'll be able to retain it for longer time. hope it helps.
They say that at the end of course you would be able of programing a computer, but this is not true, the reality is that they will teach some functions (very important) and how you use the Matlab community to get help resolving problems.
First 4-5 Weeks were brilliant, but I found the last 3 weeks to be less engaging and I often had to look outside the course for help with the activities because the material given was either not enough or too confusing for me to follow.
The explanation can be quiet brief and clear for better understanding.The topics which arent taught are given in the assignment which makes difficult in solving. Assignment program topics must be completely taught by the instructor.
The course is very good but the assignments are very hard for beginners, sometimes you get almost lost, you don't know how to start.The assignments level is very high compared to the lessons examples.
The course was a lot more challenging than I expected for an introductory course. I really struggled from around lesson 4/5. I will practice some more before considering taking the next course.
The last two assignments , image blur and echo generator were out of the scope , it took me alot of days to complete it. At least some videos related to these assignments should have been added
the content they teach is basic and the assignment problems they give is quite complicated. so i would suggest them to give easy assignments first and then increase the difficulty level
I had trouble in too many assignments because several of the commands were used that were not explained in the lecture but has to be used in assignments. Overall it was a great course
The course is very good, learned a lot. But there is a problem, for a course stated as Introduction, the exercises get much more complex than the classes by the seventh week.
Its fantastic experience, I am updating my self, my suggestion is course era team should include more tutorial related to real time problem which is solved by MATLAB
I felt the course was too slow for me, also the assignments given for us to solve, were difficult and there were no hints in the lectures to help the difficulties.
Assignments are very difficult after 6th week.One enters 7th week without enough preparation.I mean slope  of learning is too high after 6th week.
the final assignments are very tough for a beginner to complete. I wish they could work on that.The course's overall content is appreciable
I would give it 5 stars if the course also taught me some engineering applications of MATLAB with examples. For instance, solving PDEs.
The teacher is completely boring. I did take lessons from other materials to complete this course. But the assignments are good.
wrap up exam showing error simultanously as the code is correct. Due to that i could not continue the coarse.
the assignments were tough to answer.but the course was really good,all the videos  were clear to understand
this course is very useful for begginers, please add lecture topics related to assignment also.
Good Platform of learning Programming with Matlab  overall good experience with Matlab .
All the course good though free acess to the text book should be provided by the course
course was good to begin with however a module on calculus will be of more help.
Instructor of this course is very nice, really enjoyed learning this skill
Everything is good, but asking for money for purchasing certificate.
this course is great  for biggners but there some voids in concepts
Later weeks assignments are too challenging for a beginner.
Assignment questions gets really hard toward the end!!!
Average, and somewhere i think course of speed is fast
more basic for last few assignments should be thought
solutions should visible before solving the problem
Too complicated assignments not taught in course
if there is more examples then that will be good
Awesome learning Matlab with this instructor.
Assignment Questions were not well explained
Coursera App is not that much user friendly
Very helpful but sometimes it is too slow
YOU ARE GIVING DIFFICULT HOME WORKS
too difficult assignments
it is very  useful course
too easy compared to cs50
Too easy!!!!
Good.!
the course was very comprehensive and ideal for beginners to understand the basics of programming. the level of this course increases gradually. this course is a stepping stone for beginners to learn other programming languages comfortably
A very goo course. However, there is a very steep jump between the session levels and especially the final assignments. The final assignments are very interesting actually and practical. Would have been more helpful if some of the assignments in the individual sessions also had some practical problems thrown in to get the students better prepared.
I started this course without any background knowledge of MATLAB but special thanks to Fitzpatrick Sir for explaining each & every concept very nicely. As far as mine learning is concerned I would rate it around 75% & rest 25% depends on my practice. This course has definitely provided me with the necessary skills and confidence to use it in solving MATLAB problems. The syllabus has been amazingly designed.One negative thing that I felt about this course was level of difficulty of last 2-3 weeks for a beginner. May be it's easy for a person who has some past experience of programming. As a suggestion I would like to have few solved assignments be explained in video lecture ( of high difficulty) instead of giving them as an assignment.
It is a really informative course overall, the assignments are interesting and generally not boring, however some of the assignments need more clarification. Digging for info from discussions is an experience on its own but that can discourage people from completing the course and giving up on programming entirely so that seems like it needs some improvements. Fitzpatrick is a great instructor and tries to keep the videos chill and a bit more enjoyable and to be honest he made me laugh out loud a couple of times. Other instructors seem to help people taking the course regularly on the discussion forums so don't be afraid to ask questions there. Thank you for the great course. <3
This is one of the best course related to computer programming that I came across. All the concepts are very well explained. Homework assignments are very much challenging. If you are a beginner, completing the homework assignments will take lot of time and will sometimes be frustrating. However, forums will be one of your best asset while completing this course. All the mentors and Instructors answer to all your concern. They will not give you the exact code for your answer, but they will guide you so that you can solve the questions. Some of the questions will be tough and may take days for you to figure out(speaking out of my own personal experience), but keep posting in the forums. So, if you are going for the course certificate then be prepared for the effort and time that will be used up to complete the Home work assignments. A good time will be to learn in your vacations, but don't stress yourself while your college is going on. Since this was only an introduction to MATLAB, you will not be learning how to create GUIs and entire softwares. Also, if you are looking forward to know how to use MATLAB on some hardwares, then you are not going to find it in this course. However, if you ask the mentors where to learn those things from, they will guide you. They also have a textbook available for the course, but I completed the course very well without it. So, it's not a compulsion, but I am going to buy it so that I have a better understanding about how to create GUIs for the code that I type. Tl;dr: This is the best course if you are a beginner and have no experience in programming, but if you are an expert programmer, you might get bored with some initial topics, but later things do start to get interesting. Also, you need to dedicate your time and effort to complete Home work assignment.
Positive points:-this really is a beginners course, without any knowledge about coding or the syntax of MATLAB necessary.-you learn by solving the problems yourself. This gives you great insight about the thought processes necessary, about different approaches and how to realize your ideas.-Mentors are responding quickly (sometimes within a half hour) and are doing there best to help you out.
Negative points:-The video lectures, although informative have a very slow paste and the earlier ones do not prepare you that well for the homework assignments. However once you get used to it you will manage to get an idea about the assignments from the lectures. Still the same problem is illustrated way too often in the same lecture. One could either add different problems or shorten the lectures a lot. With time it is possible to learn when one can skip a section but it makes it especially hard for people to start the course, since one spends hours watching videos for just learning about basic syntax in the beginning - For some of the homework assignments the mathematical part was the bigger challenge for me than the coding part, which is really frustrating when you just want to learn how to code.
I started this course as a complete beginner not only in MATLAB but in programming in general. The lectures are really straight foward and they use practical examples that you can recreate in MATLAB and they are not heavy on the theory part. Every week comes with a bunch of assigments and there is a grading system that automatically tests your code which is very useful and makes the whole process quicker. As a beginner, I noticed that these assignments started getting very challenging after the first half of the course but luckily there is a very useful forum where you can get some support and see other people threads as well as a lot of tips given by the instructor. I personally got stuck a few times but the instructor replied in no time in deep detail so I was able to figure out what I was missing. I really recommend this course to everyone; in just a few weeks I was able to go from not knowing anything about programming to writing MATLAB code on my own.
Great course for the most part but, in my opinion, this is not an introductory course. It seems to be more like an introductory course if you have taken one but did not exactly pass the first time. The videos are easy enough to follow and he is very good at explaining as he goes but whereas the difficulty level of the videos is at a two, the difficulty level is at an eight. Luckily for me, I was taking this class for work and at work so I was able to get help when needed, but even then it was still a struggle for the majority of my colleagues to help me when it came down to actually doing the homework.  So I would either recommend matching the difficulty level of the homework assignments to the videos or changing the course to a second introductory course, just to recap on past experience. Even though it sounds like I did complain, it was still an amazing class leading to 4/5 star review.
for me i got more than what i expected in that course> the instructor really has an awesome way in presenting the tools and concepts in the videos> some of the videos included info that i already knew previously but i was hearing about it here in a different helpful manner> some of the info shown here were presented in a manner that's more helpful and organized than the documentation of the MATLAB itself for me.> A part of the course videos was really long it exceeded 30 minutes which was really boring to me and frankly speaking forced me to resist the need to procrastinate completing the video many times.> Finally, I'm really happy at the end of that course as i found a lot of material and support and motivated way to learn new staff > thanks to all of you for your efforts to produce such a strong course
I was noob to take this course. I wished i would get much help by doing this course. At the beginning of this course, until week 5. I was trying and trying to write a code and get a solution. It was not that easy but somehow manageable. I tried and tried. It took more than 2 hours to complete a code for me. But after week 5, it was very hard for me. It was so depressing that, i couldn't solve a problem by myself. I had to take help from my friends to solve each problem. I thought i missed something, thats why i am facing this problem. But no, i didn't miss any lectures. Out of nowhere hardest problems just pops up on the monitor! I don't know if everyone feels the same way or only me. But it was a great course indeed. The instructor tried his best and he is very cool.
I highly recommend this course created by valuable professors and mentored with valuable enthusiasts. It is a hard course especially for beginners like me, but it certainly gives you the aspect on how to think like a programmer while teaching Matlab's good features throughout the course. If you are interested in programming, if you want to practice on programming on Matlab, this is the course what you look for. I also suggest you to get the certificate. Engineers and scientists would surely benefit from it. The only things I criticize are that the course is much harder than expected for beginners and the lessons are not really comprehensive even if they are highly beneficial and of high quality. Thanks!
Honestly i liked the way he teach and especially is some bad jokes and all, besides the first 5 weeks is really interesting and keeps me concentrate enough to him and after that you know well the programming parts comes and literally started getting dizzy and at last like come on still how much i have got to go. Finally the assignments that's really tested my patience because for most of the assignment i don't the concept and all, so i just really googled it and read one by one line to understand the concept behind that. And I don't know weather i am going to use this MATLAB and all but now itself i am glad that i know MATLAB somewhat.once again Thank you professor and everyone in this team.
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,ich fand Ihren MATLAB "introductory" Kurs sehr ansprechend und den Beginn sehr gelungen. Ich war eine absolute AnfÃ¤ngerin und konnte bis Woche 7 alles alleine absolvieren. Danach brauchte ich jedoch die Hilfe eines Bekannten mit Informatik Kenntnissen, um die weiteren Aufgaben erfolgreich abzuschlieÃen.  Der Kurs bietet einen guten ersten Eindruck in die Welt des Programmierens allerdings braucht man, um den Kurs alleine zu beenden ohne Vorkenntnisse viel Zeit auÃerhalb des Kurses, in der man sich mit der empfohlenen Literatur beschÃ¤ftigt.Liebe GrÃ¼Ãe und allen viel Erfolg,eine zufriedende Teilnehmerin!
Easy to understand.... Just perfect for people who are new to programming. Well, to be able to finish the assignment.... you would need a little understanding of Maths. During this course, you will learn the basic understanding of programming, how computer works, and as well how to program in Matlab & some Matlab term( Basic Calculation, Matrices, Vectors, Scalar, Functions, Built-in Function, Selection, Loop, Data Type, File Input/Output ). After completing the course, you should be equipped with basic  solid understanding of programming in Matlab. This may help you to build complex algorithm in the near future.
la verdad el curso me ayudÃ³ bastante y aprendÃ­ muchÃ­simas cosas nuevas me pareciÃ³ muy interesante todo, me siento muy feliz de haberlo terminado, estoy seguro que todo me va servir en mi vida laboral. cositas por mejorar, serÃ­a que en algunos problemas la pedagogÃ­a de explicaciÃ³n deberÃ­a ser mÃ¡s clara ya que  se prestaba a no entender muy bien lo que se tenÃ­a que hacer.del resto todo excelente, las explicaciones de los temas  muy bien te queda todo claro ademÃ¡s el profesor auxiliar siempre estaba dispuesto a resolver cualquier inquietud por medios de los foros.recomiendo este curso a todos.
I would like to mention the positive and negative aspects of this course separately.Postives sides: 1. Covers many many things of matlab. 2. Assignments are really involving. 3. Very expert instructor.Negative sides: 1. Sometimes, the assignments are a bit too involving and the problems are sometimes not explained as much as it was needed. 2. Some of the videos are a bit too long.Overall: A great course. If you remain consistent throughout the course, complete the assignments regularly, you will definitely come out well-acquainted with matlab and confident about using it in your discipline.
A very good course for beginners who have little or no knowledge about MATLAB. It starts from scratch one and explains everything in detail with ample amount of examples. The instructor keeps cracking jokes to make it sound funny so that you don't fall asleep in between ! The assignments keep becoming tricky as you pass on to higher lessons and require a lot of practice as it tests the knowledge beyond the scope of the online lectures provided here. Overall its a good head-start learning course for anybody who is interested in working with MATLAB - The Matrix Laboratory !
The course on overall basis was good. The instructor tried his best. The content of the course was perfect for beginners but the assignments really would upset any beginner, though I was fine as I have enough background. The assignments on the brighter side leads to logic development of one's. The difficulty of assignments in the very last week steeps upwards and no background of it is provided in that weeks lecture ,although one can always learn on their own after coming this far. On completing this course by yourself you'll surely think that it was worthy !
Overall, clear explanation and helpful interaction. The professor is skilled at introducing the intuition behind the formulas and codes. However, the assignments are isolated from the video lecture. Hence, it is difficult for those with little or no previous programming experience to pass this course. Also, hard to practice what we have learned from the lecture. I believe here is the room for improvement: Delete assignments that is too complicated and instead add the task of manageable levels to help students to understand more.
Very well done, I loved the lectures and enjoyed the assignments. I had no previous experience of programming and I found the explanation of the concepts very clear.The main critique for me is that ,for some of the problems, not having a background in physics might be..well..too challenging! It took me hours only to read about the theory behind the question, to find out the appropriate formula to use in the code, whilst writing the actual program was pretty quick.Other than that, I would certainly recommend the course.
Very good and serious course. I passed it in four sessions, having break of a couple of months between each of them. Yet, after interruptions I was immediately comfortable with Matlab. The previously acquired skills were not forgotten.Explanations are very detailed (sometimes too much detailed for me), and the exercises encourage research of additional functionalities. Pity that programming tasks for the last Lesson are not really related to it, and some of them are rather boring than challenging.
This is truly a great course
for MATLAB beginner or even for an intermediate learner to clear the concept.
This makes me able to think like a programmer. The descriptions and practice
problems are up to the mark. This should be the first course to anyone new to
the MATLAB and want to peruse a career in MATLAB programming. One
suggestion is to use little more easy problems in assignments and increase the
difficulty levels gradually. Also, suggest some practice problems source or
books.
The course was really great, I enjoyed it. It was easy to understand, however the lecture took so long, its designed for nonprogrammers and sometimes I felt I should speed up the video to listen quickly to many parts during the lecture. Regarding the quizzes, I think it would be better to jump levels in the quizzes. The quizzes in the first 7 weeks were relatively very easy compared to the last two that took lots of time and thinking to figure out how to solve them.
I got stuck in some of last week assignment, and did not have any clue what was going on. So, I refered MATLAB Community and got answer..... but still not satisfied got from that. Could you make an explanation video on Week 9 assignment and Post it in the Youtube, so that I can get overall clear explanation of what was going on?!. I have already subscribed to your Youtube channel. I loved your course, and learned so many things, Thank you sir!
The course materials are good and very well presented by course instructor. However, the homeworks are not that well designed. The main focus goes to the mathematics behind the problems instead of focusing on the programming skills. So doing the homeworks was kind of boring staffs, as I had to spend time for mathematics instead of Matlab itself. Nevertheless this course is highly recommended to get in to MATLAB programming.
Algunos ejercicios no se pueden hacer con lo explicado en el curso. El nivel de estos ejercicios deberÃ­a reducirse. Algunos ejemplos: valid date, caesar y echo gen( este Ãºltimo se complica mÃ¡s bien por la mala explicaciÃ³n y algunos conceptos mÃ¡s que por la complejidad de la funciÃ³n a programar en sÃ­).Por lo demÃ¡s, en general estÃ¡ bastante bien. Aunque a veces las explicaciones se hacen muy lentas en los videos.
The course was excellent. Although there is more to MATLAB but it's enough for a beginner. The assignments were good . I think there should be more tough assignments in between the lessons because the final problems were way tougher than the in-between lesson problems. Even though the final problems were very interesting and challenging to complete. Overall it was a very good course with a wonderful lecturer.
The course was very helpful in learning the basics of Matlab coding. Though i had an academic course in my institute on Matlab, this course helped me to strenghen my previous knowledge and also made me a better Matlab user. I found the last few exams difficult to crack. However, i am happy that i am able to finish this long course. Thanks to all the peopel behind this course. Thanks for your effort.
This Course really helped me in clearing basic concepts in MATLAB and has definitely provided me with the necessary skills and confidence to use it in handling the real life practical problem.This course also provides good base if you want to study advanced topic in MATLAB.Although most the assignment were simple and easy but final assignment must require separate video to really understand them.
The course definitely requires some programming experience. I would appreciate to have some more practice questions before hitting the problem set. Problems in the first couple of weeks were too easy, and the rest of them assumed prior experience in at least some kind of programming. In all, I think it will give you a solid base for the beginning, alghouth you may not understand it completely.
Very good and basic introduction to Matlab. If you are blank on the programming. It is recommend and almost no program pre-knowlege requirement. If you have some experience on python(or Numpy), you will see most of them are similar and very quick to handle Matlab work. The teacher and saffing team are very friendly and can response you very quickly when you have some challenge during learning.
More guidance on the assignments towards the last couple of weeks would be useful. Instructions on how to procced with the tougher assignments should be given as this is a course for beginners to programming as a whole not to experienced programmers who are new to MATLAB. Other than that, course content is the best for beginners who want to learn MATLAB.Course Content  & Delivery: 5/5
Really educational, but a lot of the problems expected you to know matlab functions already.  I started this course thinking it was an introduction, but upon re-reading the course overview it said 'Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial.'  I was still able to complete the course, but I wish problems would have been more relevant to practicing skills taught in the videos.
This courses covers a lot of useful stuffs in Python making it really very comprehensive. While homework and exams remain at an entry level. However, I strongly recommend more programming homework added and completion time expanded in order to let students go further. Also, if you want to explore every stuff in this course like me, it will take much more time than it suggests.
I have been working on MATLAB for a long time. I managed to complete this course quickly. The First 7 weeks are really easy in the last two weeks are really difficult. The instructor is focusing on the theoretical part instead he can tell more about the functions required for the assignment.  We have to google for function for lots of time. Everything else is fine.
Very good course, with clear explanations of the key concepts. However, I felt hindered in being able to complete all tasks in the homeworks each week as many questions alienate someone like me with little mathematics/physics background. I feel if the questions were more general I would have been able to perform better each week. Very good lecture content though.
Things are good but learner should have a prior knowledge of coding (in any language).Also, the problems of last 2 weeks are very very good, even they were showing 1 hr. to solve but it took me more than half a day for each, one whole day for the last one. I know I am way too slow, but what I recommend the University to have video solutions to these problems !!!
This course started with absolute ground level basics and went up to a moderate level. I really liked this course, especially the challenging assignments which were quite standard I mist say. Thank You all for developing such an amazing course and keeping it updated as more features and functions are introduced by Mathworks in the newer versions of MATLAB.
A very well designed course for both total beginners and those seeking to add to their knowledge of MATLAB. The assignments at the end seem to be oriented though towards computer science and were tough for a mechanical engineer like me, wanting numerical problem solving. A well taught course with an extremely nice lecturer, who keeps it interesting.
Assessments become a bit too difficult from week 6 or the text does not carry the goal of the test as clearly as it did for previous weeks. The examples given in the course are extremely easy compare to what is asked during assessments and some of the MATLAB functions that are necessary to write the code are not mention prior to the test.
The course was really amazing and very useful but I think many other points should be explained. Also, the solutions provided are not self-explanatory. A separate video should be added to explain the solutions to the assignments. The biggest problem was that the final problems at the end of the course are very hard are not useful at all.
This course was amazing but one thing it lacked was solved examples. We should have given 1 day of time for solved examples and then there should have been a locked video that opens after 24 hrs of reaching that mark. This way students like be would have gotten more knowledge about how to handle given problem in professional approach
Excellent experience and amazing programming explanations. I thing that from lesson 4 on, the assessments were very hard to be approved (more difficult than the previous examples). Anyway I really recommend the course for those who has not experience with programming languages (like me) or those that want to know how MATLAB works.
I enjoyed the class so much! It's a very good introduction to MATLAB. The Instructor is so smart and so FUNNY!I liked so much the last tests, they are realistic and useful.If you know nothing about MATLAB and you want to learn, this is literally the course you need.If you aren't a beginner in MATLAB, I suggest another course.
The course is very good. The difficulty gradually increases so that you can challenge yourself. The only reason why I dont give it 5 stars is because at the end I feel the assignments were not clear at all. At the very last one, I literally didn't understand what I should do so it took me too much time just to figure it out.
Very complete and interesting course for getting started with MatLab. Though some of the final assignments were quiet hard, the lessons with Mike were really fun and usefull, and so the ability to rewatch them.I woud gladly recommend this course to the people with little experience who want to start working with MatLab soon.
i am in the third week of this course and it is  designed for a beginner. They give very minute details about everything.In my opinion  the best way to learn is by making mistakes and accepting them and this course is all about learning from your mistakes. they assignment are not difficult but require a little thinking.
The course is really beneficial especially for beginners. The instructor is amazing his way of teaching. I was able to understand in detail the concepts and was successfully able to apply the things on my own in the assignments. Still i wish if the lectures were shorter in length as some of the videos were quite long.
Pace was good, one suggestion is that for the additional test cases in the grading tool, please provide the some indication of what input arguments are used so that I can put test it out on MATLAB before submitting. This is especially the case for those where pressing "Submit" incurs a long waiting/processing time.
I like this course because of its step by step explanation and real computing problems. On the other hand the last exercises is a bit boring for me especially. I hope I will finish this course . I also want to recommend to everybody who is just started to learn computing, may be you must be good in English.
During this course, I learnt MATLAB programming concepts from very basics and got opportunities to implement the concepts successively. Those assignments gave me enough confidence to work with MATLAB and solve numerical problems using it. Moving forward I am looking for more practice in MATLAB programming.
It would be better to introduce more examples for total beginners so that they are not thrown into the challenging questions immediately. Many of the items that were asked required a deeper understanding of the language than what was covered in the videos and it took away from the learning experience.
The course was really insightful and interesting. I really like the humor of the professor and he did a very good job as a teacher. However, some of the exercises were really challenging, that takes up lot of time. If some of those concepts can be taught in the course that would be really good.
Very good teaching.I loved it.But what made me to deduct one star is that the assignments in last three lessons were way too hard for beginners. But, it is also good in some way because , that motivates you to do more difficult problems. Also, I thank my teachers for their awesome teaching....
It was amazing course and professor Mike Fitzpatrick's teaching style was too good and no one would teach matlab programming in so simple and easy to understand way. Course assignments was cool it helped me in increasing my problem solving skill and different ways to solve particular problem.
An otherwise fantastic course, although some of the homework assignments at the end may need a more elaborate descriptions of what is expected, in order to help debug, rather than having to search the forums and office hours. But, a good course for learning MATLAB, even the mundane parts.
A nice foundation course for MATLAB amateurs. As a beginner, the lessons are well explained by the instructors and there are quizzes that gives you a chance to test your skills after the modules. The course also provides free MATLAB Online access, so the learning is even more comfortable.
This is a course that every Matlab beginners should attend. The course starts with some basics but getting more and more challenging later. If you stick til the end of the course, you can learn a lot from all materials and assignments. Thank you for creating this course, I enjoyed it.
This course is useful and informative. I have learnt a lot. Also I hope I can find another courses about Simulink or Advanced Programming with MATLAB introduced by the same instructor. Thank you Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Ledeczi. Thank you Vanderbilt University. Thank you much Coursera!
The content was well explained and the instructor is amazing. The only problem is that the assignment questions are not clearly explained. More examples need to be provided in the question. I was totally clueless after reading the question. Otherwise the learning part is commendable.
The lectures and materials were very very good, but the difficulty level and knowledge requirements of the homework tasks was far beyond what was covered. They said it should take two hours a week and I would sometimes spend 2+ hours on one problem (there's about 8 in each homework).
I learned a lot from this course. The only thing i observed this course was lacking is that the video lectures and the homework assignments given were not perfectly in sync with each other, as the lectures did not completely cover the things we were supposed to do in assignments.
This is my first time to use MATLAB and get very informative sessions. I have learned basic commands from this course.  It was difficult for me to solve week 7,8,9 assignments but somehow I manage. It was a wonderful experience. I have to practice more to familiar with MATLAB.
The lessons are good but some of the assignments - especially the final ones - will require you to do your own research on how to accomplish tasks. I did not purchase the book as it was not mandatory but there is a good chance that it would have helped with the assignments.
I think that this course is good but only if you have access to the book they are suggesting ( or the money to buy it). After week 4 it started getting difficult for me to write the mini fuctions and commands needed. This is my first experience with MATLAB and programming.
Great course! From the lucid, well presented content, it is a joy for a beginner as well as a seasoned programmer to take home something from this course. Please do bring out an extended version dedicated to image processing, signal processing which MATLAB mainly covers :)
it is a very good tool for all the mathematical calculations and it will helpful for solving that ranges from basic to higher end . i have learnt a lot of programming skills in this course with the guidance of good lecture videos .it helps me a lot in the future.Thank you
Informative course at a good level, i.e. neither too difficult nor too basic. The only improvement I would suggest is that I would have liked a more detailed description for the tasks in Week 9. Sometimes it was difficult to figure out what we were asked to do.
Course is really nice, got to learn a lot. The 3 Assignments provided at the end of the course was more fun. There could have been more than 3 exercises for practice. As its applications based problems, it felt more lively to solve and found more exciting.
The course is really great! It starts from covering minute details and heads to complex problems. All the assignments are fun, thought provoking and really teach you to apply what you learn. I wish the creators of this course all the best for the future.
The course was great although one suggestion would be that level of assignment problems was very easy upto week7 and last 2 weeks had very tough ones. So a gradual increase in difficulty would help us to solve tough one's with better approach. Thank you
good, i request you to kindly present a video on how to get the MATLAB sute for the course. I had learn quickly its a good type of learning i feel its like my normal college class with the best faculty. thank's to the coursera Vanderbilt university.
Quizzes hit you like a curve-ball, and the final exam is very challenging. But overall, it opened my eyes to what MATLAB can do and the learning experience is well worth it along with figuring out the solutions is sooooooooo gratifying. Thank you.
It is an amazing courese for beginners. Instructor is also great. You will enjoy learning under him. it is properly structured. Few drawbacks which I have found is the lack of number of assignments and the missing lecture on code optimisation
Very usefull, learning a lot of interesting and important things like thinking like a computer, but it was a little bit hard in the last weeks and i think that these things in these weeks are not using in every day life from a no-programmer.
towards the end .. it got really vague. it took a lot of effort to learn about audio processing and text processing , and the videos didn't do enough justice explaining them. but the rest was really helpful and the course was good overall.
Great for beginners, you get to approach programming slightly by the lens of a mathematician, an amazing course, but for someone a bit towards novice side, go for it, it finds application in every major research field, you won't regret it.
Instructor of this course  is a very good teacher who encourage  to do something interesting.  This course has definitely provided me with the necessary skills and confidence to use it in tackling the practical problems in the real world.
I agree with other reviews that the assignments (compared to the lectures) are quite tricky if you have no background in Matlab or another programming language. I had a Matlab course >10 years ago and this course was a nice refresher.
How to get MATLAB license for this course, there is no instructio or Menu as said in the lesson-1, visited Vanderbilt Website and also Mathwork website asking course offering institutions email id please help govarthanvijay@gmail.com
Very engaging presenter.  Some of the assignments tested more than your ability to program MatLab... sometimes it took a great deal of  research  to understand the type of problem you  were being asked to solve (e.g. echo generator).
A very good course. The instructor is trying his best to make the lessons more interesting. A small drawback is that the 2 last assignments need a better explanation. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basics of MatLab.
easy to understand and step by step learning, But the assignments are a a little difficult and use some extra sources than the video lectures as we need to consult the book for some functions .overall best platform and course learnt
Good introduction to MATLAB, loved the final exercises. It would be better if there is few more details provided on the exercises. Sometimes its difficult to know which formula's to use or what should happen on boundary conditions.
I think the course was very good, it really taught me how to program in MATLAB well. The only drawbacks where that it did not go over allot of functions that could have been used. Also, some of the HW assignments were unreasonable.
A very effective course indeed. Instructor is awesome & very funny. He is one of the best instructor I've seen. The course is very interesting. The forum is also very helpful. But the exercises needs a little more explanation.
Thanks a lot to all the teachers and assistants, you have helped me a lot. The lesson structure is clear and the explanation is easy to understand. I think it would be better if we can get some knowledge about some toolboxes.
A good introduction to MatLab but a lot of the homework problems could be worded more clearly and many should be changed so that one doesn't have to look up highly detailed information that doesn't pertain to programming.
the course covers most typical sections of MATLAB ,overall the course is very useful for beginners the only thing i will like to suggest is introducing some more built-in functions which might save us dozens of commands.
some upper level concepts are required towards the end, so be prepared by learning from blogs and specially from YOUTUBE.also if you got any friend or senior towards coding please do join him to grab some more concepts.
It was a nicely coordinated course and really helpful for practicing MATLAB but some of the assignment questions were a little bit unclear. Other than that the course was thoroughly awesome. Thank you to the mentor.
last 2 week assignment too much difficult am unable to solve it ,  I take help from matlab central. in video  not so much helpful to solve assignment .but i think programming needs lot of practice not only reading.
Good course overall, however I feel that giving more problems to work would be beneficial. There should be worked problems in each section so that students can gain a better understanding of how to write the code.
Assignments were too tough, specially in the end. The question were good and challenging but I would suggest you explain a few such types of problems in your video lecture and then move to hard sums. Thank you
sir,Fitzpatrick is excellent in the video lecture.Making us entertain throughout the course and therefore making the course easier.i am just near to complete my course and had an amazing experience till date.
This course was really amazing and it is well scripted and made. A great effort by the teachers who made these lectures and it never seemed boring or cumbersome to me at any point of time during the course.
I didn't like the assignment of echo. The description was not sufficient to understand the mechanism of putting echo by code. Except this, the assignments were exciting and the lectures were clear.
Although it is filtered as a Beginner's level course, but I have to admit it that completing this course is quite tough, especially latter half. Other than that, overall experience was fabulous.
The course was very informative and ideal for beginners. It can be a bit challenging during the later lessons however the forums are there to help you with those assignments you find difficult.
COURSE IS PRETTY EASY IN THE BEGINNING  BUT IT BECOMES EXTREMELY TOUGH FOR AN AMATEUR PROGRAMMER SO ITS BETTER TO HAVE A GOOD INSIGHT INTO PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL PRIOR TO STARTING THIS COURSE
I found the language in some of the exercises a bit difficult to understand. The last exercise was very challenging and mostly because it took me a while to understand what was been asked.
I think the last few assignments were really tough. there should have been much more classes related to those final assignments. although, it was a great journey to begin with the MATLAB.
I have loved the learning i have been able to do and look forward to taking many more classes with them...The videos are very well done . I appreciate the format  and set up of course..
The course was really nicely structured and the assignment was almost completely related to the video tutorial. Though it would have been great if we had dealt more in image processing.
It's very recommended for beginnersI am one of them and I've learnt so muchI wanted some more details , extra level and solutions for assignments but it still very good and useful
I found this course very informative and handy for knowledge. The homework was undeniably tricky but try your best at it and don't give up thinking. Keep thinking and persisting.
Basic Matlab usage, not very advanced aspect of Matlab because it is an introductory course. But I think the assignments are very useful and can help develop programming skills.
Instructor and teaching both are good. But i found that last three to four assignment are a bit difficult for a beginner, that's the only reason i deduce one star from rating.
Great course! A humorous and brilliant instructor makes this course an awesome learning journey! But I felt that assignments were a bit too challenging for the beginner level.
very informative and easy to follow, lots of new techniques that should help me on my way. It was fun to learn programming with matlab thankyou for your guidance and support.
It was very interesting to learn programming with MATLAB, kind of matrices involved everywhere which has invoked more curiosity in me! Thank you, the staff were excellent.
The course was informative and provided the basic programming skill on MatLab. The course also provided innovative assignments that build up your problem-solving skills.
the explanation was fantastic the material was good.But some graphs and plotting concepts were missing.it would be better if you include some graph plotting functions.
last two weeks require few more exmples something related to the home work so that students may know how to approach the different problem in differert way thank you .
En varios videos de las diferentes semanas que componen el curso, los subtitulos tapan el contenido de la explicacion en curso, habria que colocarlos de mejor manera.
A very useful course for beginners in Matlab programming. It helps to understand the basic concept of programming which you can utilize in different programming also.
This course is very easy to follow even if one has very little prior knowledge about programming. Great course to get anyone started with programming in MATLAB.
I would recommend  this course to everyone who has interest in maths with programming. This course will be beneficial for my further study in computer science.
Very good for both beginners in programming starting off with MATLAB and those wishing to learn a new language. Great material and the e-book is a nice add-on
This course was a good introduction to Matlab. My only criticism is that some of the assignment prompts are vague and the feedback in the forums can be slow.
The assignments were challenging, lectures were long. Overall great lessons learnt and quite a lot of coding practice done while completing this course.
the instructor sometimes is boringwhen he was illustrating on matlab the application it self i couldnt see what he was writing because of the subtitle
The course gave me wonderful experience of MATLAB. The course assignments were really helpful to test the logical thinking and MATLAB features.Thanks.
So far the course appears to be very good, but the request for an upgrade after every video becomes more and more annoying as the number multiplies
The Course was very well framed. Although what they teach you is not enough, the assignments are very challenging indeed. Overall course is great.
Nicely complied course to learn MATLAB. All the assignment are worth solving since it helped in practical implementation of what is being taught.
the course is over all to good but i last of the course we have some problems to understand some structs and many other things in last to weeks
The course was nice, i learned lots of concept of introductory functions of matlab,which will help me for the future programming applications.
I didn't know anything about programming and with this course now I feel more confident to try to do a new type of analysis in my experiments.
The course is really helpful. I think MATLAB is one of the easiest programming language to learn if you are not from I.T. background like me.
This course is amazing. I learned a lot of new MATLAB tricks that did not know aboutIt was very easy and interesting to follow. Thank you.
good course but if it had more progress in matlab, it'd be better.i mean that the content is so little. it contained few topics in Matlab
If only it has a section to introduce the usage of pde toolbox, but this course is still so good and the teacher is humour. Thank you!
it's been a pretty good and well-explained course's which i have been ever taken . Amazing instructor every week is like an adventure
IF BUILTINFUNCTIONS ARE EXPLAINED AT STARTING,IT WILL BE MORE HELPFUL INDOING ASSIGNMENTS AND WRITING A PROGRAM FOR NEW FUNCTIONS
Course was quite good. Explanations were easy to follow. I think the last chapter should have been covered a bit more in detail.
the course was good and ia can able to learn the programming in matlab and also the image recogonition and saddle point concept.
great class but difficult didn't expect it to be the caliber it is, but slightly not surprising since its offered at Vanderbilt
It's a great course if you need to learn basics of MATLAB syntax. I also recommend watching the most lectures on x1.25 speed ;)
It is good to learn programs with easier solving problems . We can Design ,debug , architecture with problems through MATLAB .
audio processing question related data should have been explained. Like for starters we don't know what is s time series data
It was a great course. I learned a lot. but the grading policy is tough to get 75% to pass. Overall the experience was great.
I had much difficulties to solve the last final assignments. It will be better if you added details on audio and image files
It was an excellent course as an introductory class. I feel like we could have had more problems, but overall it was great!
the course is very fine in the beginning it seems easy but as the lessons pass it became harder which gives kick to do it.
the only real issue was the fact that some of the assignments objectives were really vague and required more explanations.
The course is really good. but the final problems are bit too hard to solve for me as a person with no coding background.
good programming language to learn.it opens up a wide variety to solve any problem in which mathematics modeling is used.
Informational and interesting course that goes from the basics of the MATLAB interface to writing programs using MATLAB.
This course is really wonderful. The teachers of this course try to expose all the syntax and problems  easy and nicely.
The way of teaching is good .The given examples explaination was also good The assignments was quite realated and doable
The lessons are very clear and easy to follow . However, the assignments are quite difficult for non-programming people.
Certain videos are long, which could be made shorter. The basic exercises and practices are few. The book is excellent.
I like this course. If we can get subtitles while the teacher is teaching, we can get to know many things.thank you.
I recommend this session to all aspiring MATLAB programmer. The course is managed and student can learn very easily.
Videos are okay, but the learning of software should be in the forms of worked out examples parallel to explanation
The course is useful for beginners and new learners. Nut the difficulty of graded external tool increases suddenly.
Make errors more clear. When i was solving any problem and error occurred, the external tool was not of much help.
i liked the way of teaching from this online classes. now i can go for learning advance matlab. i enjoyed classes.
The explanations are really good, but some of them are too long and boring (i wish they would more comprehensive)
A very good platform for basic learners of MATLAB.The assignments are effective. It was a good experience for me.
I am new to MATLAB, i learned a lot from this course. I will try to solve more engineering problems using MATLAB
whenever i gets any confusion regarding any problem in matlab, u can just revisit it , then it gets clarified
The last 2 weeks were so long and not effective as the previous ones, But total it was very good and helpful
This course was challenging, because it involved not only coding but problem solving with math through code.
These course is very help full in my future.The course is very good and am enthusiastic to learn this course
A USEFUL COURSE IN MY LOCKDOWN PERIOD. I GAINED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE IN MATH CONCEPT IN THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
This course was great but at the end I was doing more than my line of work (Psychology statistics) requires.
The assignments towards the 7th 8th and 9th week should be more in relation to what is taught in the video.
it was really really good experience. very good tutor. expecting some discount depending on my performance.
Good course for matlab beginners, helps alot in writing functions and plotting. Explaination is excellent.
This course was really helpful and people who like to learn basics of matlab they can join this course. :)
it is a very good introductory course, i'm really enjoying it! however, lessons can sometimes be very slow
Video Lectures were truely relevant and understoodable easily but Graded Assignmnets were somewhat tough
The topics covered were good! But the videos were too lengthy and were unable to view in landscape mode!
Very challenging exercises, videos are mostly insightful but can be made in more parts so it's not long
Useful introductory course.  Assignments are helpful, though it sometimes also gets quite mathematical.
explanation of details is excellent ! but speed is a few low ! and please be more advancethank you Fitz
Had a great experience with this tool. It really connect my skills from virtual world to a real world.
GOOD MORNING SIR,its very helpful to learn the Matlab program for the beginners also and thank you sir
Thank you for beginning with the basics!  I appreciate that you assumed that we did not know anything!
there could have been more explanation about assignment question by adding examples in each question.
Great videos. Need more practical questions and exercises without a large jump in difficulty, though
The content was good.I suggest for beginners it's a very good course to understand basics of MATLAB.
It is really a very helpful and amazing tutorial, as it contains many interesting and new problems.
Course was really informative, little boring also. And last week assignment was really very tough.
Very Nice Course. It create a great interest in MATLAB. It will help me and my students in future.
This was an amazing journey  to develop my skill and knowledge,   thanks to VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY
Way of teaching was great. its easily understandable with alot of problems for practice purpose
IT'S VERY HELPFUL AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.I LEARNT BASICS OF MATLAB.THIS COURSE IS VERY HELPFUL
GREAT FOR LEARNING BASICS OF MATLAB, though practise exercises were difficult and good quality
sir's teaching methods were very good .Students can easily understand the difficult concepts
Overall, a very good course. A few more examples to practice the concepts would be helpful.
Great course ,to start with MATLAB ,would like to thank the instructor and support staff .
It is a good course for anyone who wish to learn basic programming, matlab applications.
Started from the basics and taken to expert level. The instructor is good in explaining.
Its an excellent and engaging course with a hands on approach which is very effective.
Good course, but the problem descriptions of the final assignments could be improved.
thank you for these type of free course we acpect more these type of course in future
thank you sir,this is the great course happy to learn matlab by vanderbilt university
Good course giving all the information and perfect examples to begin learning MATLAB.
Very well explained by the instructor. Coursera is a very good platform for learning.
Even though it was difficult to comprehend but it was helpful for future preferences
It was fun doing this course and now I'm able to write a program on my own.thank you
Well structured course. It's an important one for specially engineers and scientist.
easily understandable, homework and final problems are extremely challenging though
Excellent course! But.. needs more attention for practicing the practical exercises
very useful course .Every video is define so nicely and each step of the programme
BEST WAY TO LEARN  THIS MATLAB PROGRAMMING .THANK YOU FOR GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY.
So easy... But the problem description of some homework assignments is very vague.
Course was useful. Felt that it could have been a little simpler towards the end.
Awesome content and very easily taught syllabus. Programming was never this easy.
Anyone can take this course and he/she will surely get the basics idea of MATLAB
it was really a challenging course. I learnt many new commands and techniques.
Very well structured course and quite a helpful tool for engineering students.
This course is beneficial for engineering students to know how to run matlab.
It is a good course, you work a lot but the teachers show you enough to learn
The course was very good. To the end a liitlr bit havy, but good.Many thanks
I love the way the instructor of the course delivered it. Kudos to you sir
helped me out a lot! explained so thoroughly even idiots could understand.
VERY INTRESTING COURSE AND IT HELPED IN LEARNING THE BASICS OF PROGRAMMING
good but more examples and shorter videos would have made me give a 5 star
i m very thankful to you sir....... the best larning site ever in my life
course was really ,instructors were also goodi really enjoyed the course
great experience, exploring functional matlab, and great community helps
This is very good course, great mind storming while doing assignment...

It is an excellent course to introduce knowledge of Matlab.
There is a requirement of upgrading course to new version of MatLab
good teaching method . and examination is plus point of this course
the assignments were difficult to solve and I tried to solve some.
It was definitely a good course for learning the basics of MATLAB.
the videos sometimes show a very little part of the tutor's screen
A good introductory course for beginners in programming and Matlab
The lectures had very detailed explanations. It was easy to grasp.
It was a very good kick start for me to learn the basics of MATLAB

For technical students , last 2 week course is not needed.
It is a wonderful course and understanding is made simple.
It was good course and i am satisfied with  this sessions
Really, the programming tasks need more precise wordings.
Its good but more real-life problems should be included.
I found this course very useful to accelerate my career.
Very good course, it has some mind-blowing problem sets.
Clean and practical MATLAB introduction, really enjoyed
Very good structured and effective techniques are used.
It was agreat learning. Hope to learn more. Thank you

great course!!!!!
awesome to done .
Awesome teaching
It's informative
First course
Impeccable.
very superb
fabulous..
quiz
It was a very involving course! Everything is taught by doing it practically. Assignments are really good and make you adept in what you learn the whole week. As far, the Best MOOC I've completed.
Week 9 assignment should be little bit easy or else more information should be provided in the lecture. Overall I really enjoyed the course. It just build my foundation and rest depends on me. Thank you coursera for providing this course.
Very good course, it has some really mind blowing problem sets. I would suggest everyone to hit the problems with a blank mind, i found completely different ways to solve them, and that was amazing.
There is much more to MATLAB than what the course can cover.  But It has definitely provided me with the necessary skills and confidence  to use it in tackling the practical problems in the real world.
I REALLY LOVE THIS COURSE!!! 20 days ago, I am not familiar about MATLAB, and one of my friend who is very good at using it and he recommended me to learn the course. I was so afraid of learning programming at the beginning but when I firstly wrote the function by myself, I felt extremely exhilarated! I really enjoy MATLAB! After I learned how to use debugger, it helps me a lot when I debug my function! To be honest, you really need to spend a lot time to complete quizzes after each lessons. Although some problems sets are difficult, they are absolutely interesting! I am thinking of the structures of function even when I was walking, eating or sleeping! There are many times that I thought of the problems when I slept and I programmed the function immediately when I waked up. Oops, I forget to say that I majored at biotechnology, so this course is friendly to naive learner.Just do it! When you decide to learn it, I am sure you are definitely to 'open' yourself a new world! Thank you very much, @Paul. A very very very nice mentor! Really hope to see you in USA in the future!I LOVE MATLAB!
Excellent course! If you are a beginner, this course is for you: you will learn programming in MATLAB.If you already have some experience, this course is for you too: you will refresh many things you probably forgot about MATLAB.
One of the best courses I have enrolled in. The instructor is simply great; the way he explains the concepts is effortless to understand. The lectures are fun. The assignments are quite useful to understand and grasp the topic thoroughly. They provide a plethora of coding assignments and tests throughout the courses. They are thus helping us revise what we had learned a couple of lectures back by applying the knowledge to write actual codes. Discussion in weely forums helps clear doubts. The fact that the staff is actively participating in the forums and providing assistance and hints to problems enhances the overall experience of taking up the course.
Instructor of this course Mike Fitzpatrick is a very good teacher who encourage students to do something new and interesting.I really enjoyed learning  this course and learned new skills in MATLAB.
Awesome course!! Had a great time and experience programming with matlab. The assignments were really inquisitive and thought provoking. They helped a lot. Besides, the course materials and video lectures were just awesome to attend. They were designed keeping in mind that everyone is at the same level and is an absolute beginner in matlab. Just superb!! Will recommend to anyone who is an absolute beginner in matlab or programming world.
wow this course is excellent, i done this course during the lockdown, and this helped me to pass out lockdown time. and this course further helps me in future , thanks to Akos Ledeczi and coursera .
It was my first completed course in coursera and it is perfectly organised and is one best course for aspirants who want to learn MATLAB. Thanks to all the team who worked on building this course
Amazingly beautiful Lectures by Fitz.Very nice modules. i have just started taking the lessons and its exactly what I expected it to be! If not, better!
Very good course with extra-ordinary explanation. I was just zero in  programming but with the help of this course now I am able to think like a programmer and able to solve advanced MATLAB problems.
This was an amazing course! I attended mainly because I needed to refresh my modest Matlab knowledge. It was a great help and the exercises were so much fun!! Thanks for such a great opportunity!
As a physics/math major transitioning into mechanical engineering for my graduate degree, I enrolled in this course to refresh and refine my programming skills as well as to aid improve my MATLAB-specific skills. I had been briefly exposed to MATLAB, and had also taken some introductory courses in Python, R, and FORTRAN, but I expected to learn from this course. And it did not disappoint!The course is well designed with an emphasis on general programming through the use of MATLAB as an interface. I believe MATLAB is probably one of the better intro programming languages to learn because its syntax is comparatively intuitive and simple for beginners compared to other languages such as FORTRAN and C/C++/C#. The primary lecturer in the course video instruction is Dr. Fitzpatrick, an adjunct professor of electrical/computer engineering who demonstrates expert level proficiency in both presenting and explaining the material. He is also, dare I say, quite a charming and witty gentleman who gave a refreshing and engaging presentation of material that may otherwise have seemed monotonous. I highly recommend the complementary course e-text, which is filled with more in-depth explanations of more advanced topics, more worked-through problems, and more practice problems with solutions. It's only $10, and it will be a great reference guide.I will mention that the course demands a significant amount of time, especially towards the end where problems become much more complex. Even having some background in programming, it still took me much longer than the suggested homework time to work through the last several assignments. I also would have preferred the course to have a more detailed explanation of some of the aspects of MATLAB that make it stand out as a programming language, such as its plotting. I suppose much of that is included in the extensive documentation, though, and the course is designed to provide beginner programmers with the basic tools at their disposal to code. I would look forward to a more advanced sequel course that would provide further details on solving more complex problems, especially in the physical sciences, as well as outlining how some of the numerical methods of problem solving are implemented in MATLAB.
I appreciate that  Professors Mike Fitzpatrick and Akos Ledeczi, took from zero to a great understanding of the basics concepts of MATLAB programming . Even though I am Civil Engineering background, I could able to understand and perform well in the assignments.  They performed this course in a manner to explode our capabilities both in the programming as well as the troubleshooting process.  I would like to thank both of them to made me to learn during this lock down period.                                                                                                            --- Umesha PK
It is a fantastic course. You will learn from the very basic features of programming such as data types up to complex arrays and mathematic calculations. Professor Fitzpatrick will also teach you everything about loops and conditional statements. Besides that, the tests you need to pass and the assignments you need to complete are quite educative and they show you the expected answer when the assignment is particularly difficult.
The first thing you will notice in this course that , the lessons are easy to understand and  assignments are fun and worth digging hard.and the staff  members(Mr.Brandon Armstrong) are avalible .a good introduction !
I would like to thank vanderbilt university for providing such a wonderful course and i am much impressed by the use of the basic matrices in each and every programming purpose.thank you again!!!!:)))
Extremely well written tutorials,real world problems,and an excellent theme background music makes this course a must for every MATLAB programming enthusiast.
A well structured course in MATLAB that stars from basics and accelerates to advance problems.
This is a fabulous course. It was exactly what I was looking for. Although of course it won't suit everyone's needs, I think it succeeds in providing a broad overview of basic Matlab functionality in a short period of time. I appreciate the instructor's self-deprecating humor, which is just enough to keep things light without detracting from the purpose of the class. The forum is great, and I always found T.A. responses to be prompt and helpfulâkudos to those unsung heroes of education! I had a bit of an unusual experience with the course in that I actually began it in December 2018 while on a school break, but had to stop after Week 7 when my university classes resumed. I wasn't able to return to this course until September 2019, at which time I began at the very start again and completed all 9 weeks. What I found is that the format of the class had changed in the interim. Both the earlier and the current formats are fine, and most of the lecture material is the same, but there are a few notable differences. Now, assignments are interspersed with the lectures, rather than being clustered at the end of each week. It seems to me that as a consequence there's a bit of misalignment between lecture material and the assignments on occasion, and it might be good to review that to get a better mesh. Also, the grader has changed. I like both the old and the new grader format equally well, but it would be good to be able to see the test conditions for each test case in the new grader, which (as I recall) students were able to do in the previous format. Lastly, my impression is that in the new format there are fewer assignments overall, and I would suggest to the instructor that the number of assignments could be increased. To sum up, nothing is perfect, but I really don't think you'll find a better introduction to Matlab. Highly, highly recommended.
After doing a lot of research online, I feel fortunate to have come across this course. It is a perfect introduction for anyone to get ready to make excellent use of all tools/capability available with Matlab for practical purposes, especially in science and engineering field. The instructors have really thought through on how to expose programming concept and Matlab concept to someone with almost zero experience. If you sincerely finish this course, including all the exercises you are way ahead of the crowd. Even the textbook (optional) is offered at a student friendly prices. The concepts in textbook covered great breadth & depth of real-world problems that can be tackled with Matlab. This is much more than plain-n-simple Matlab Onramp course. It really prepares you to go deep into Matlab if you wish upon completion of course.Many people complain of difficulty of final exercises. But without that you won't be able to tackle real world engineering problems. So these assignments strongly make you think logically on how to make best use of function of Matlab. The stronger the training, the better prepared one becomes.Thanks a ton Prof. Fitzpatrick & Prof. Ledeczi. You have delivered more than what you committed. We are thankful to have gotten exposure to this seasoned class being taught for decades at Vanderbilt.
This is the only one course, I have paid for certificate. I liked most of the course. Instructor has a unique way of teaching Matlab. He started Matlab basics. After that, he had shown functions. The reason of showing functions at the very first times was to evaluate the problems. I am so surprised  when I have seen the usage of column operator in such different ways. Course was followed by decision structures, loops, strings and file I/O. The course content was well prepared. Video lectures are quite helpful. Especially, 1 hour problem solving example video was so beneficial. However, at the end of the course, problems become quite challenging and time consuming. In first 6 problem set, my success rate was 100%. But, in last two week's problems I was able to solve only 5 of 8. The problems become difficult to understand, there were not enough explanations or hints. Discussion pages were not useful some times. I had to make further research on internet to understand the problem and it was time consuming. In the new version of the course, it would be better if problems are clear to understand. In short, the Instructors and Mentors did great job. Do I suggest this course to anyone else? The answer is definitely YES! Thank you.
Great curse. I had a little bit of MATLAB experience so I was able do complete the first 5 weeks in a few days. Watching the videos in 1.75x speed saved some time when dealing with the easy topics. However, week 6 and following got harder and I spent quite some time figuring out how to code. It's fascinating how one can spent multiple hours to code something with loops and difficult indexing etc., but then when looking at the solution afterwards there is that big "aha" moment when one becomes aware of how simple the code could have been. Its like everything in the world...practice makes the master.The 3 final problems in week 9 were interesting and great programming fun. I would say there could be more final problems though in order to get more practice. Overall the course is fantastic and I recommend it to everybody who wants to learn programming. The videos explain everything you need but also how to search for tips independently. A little bit feel for linear algebra is advantageous but in general there is no higher math skill required in order to be able to complete this course.I will search Coursera for more programming/MATLAB courses. Thank you to all who make this online course possible.
If you really want to learn (honestly) MATLAB lemme tell ya this is the place! I am amazed with the fine quality of this course everything lectures , materials provided , assignments , tie up with MathWorks everything...one thing  i loved the most  about this course is it's not like any ordinary course i.e there are long lectures but not one which kills your curiosity honestly the way of delivering lectures is just excellent ,at every moment you will feel like what's next , how is so , why is so , can i try this , what will be the result of it..... this list is just never endingand the whole credit for delivering and making  such excellent lectures goes to Sir J. Michael Fitzpatrickhe makes this course work like kinda interaction with us by his mysterious ways.NOTE : If you have 1% mood/need/desire/curiosity etc to learn MATLAB let the god assure you in the name of J. Michael Fitzpatrick he will give you your rest 99%and am writing this review because of him & because of this excellent coursemy sincere thanks to J. Michael Fitzpatrick , VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY and COURSERA
I found this course not only a perfect start for programming but also for Matlab. Before starting with this course, I had no prior knowledge in programming and thus used to hate it. I always used to think that programming would be difficult and it's not my cup of tea. But now, after completing this course, I can proudly say that I know programming, and more than that, I have just starting loving it !!!!I would like to thank Vanderbilt University and Prof. Fitzpatrick for providing with this wonderful course. This online course not even once felt me like an online course. The credit for that totally goes to Prof. Fitzpatrick's way of teaching. My favorite part of the course was not only your quirky remarks and nerdy (but hilarious) jokes but also that you made programming extremely interesting. After this perfect basics foundation, I am completely ready to dive in deeper into Matlab programming.In short, the Instructors and Mentors did a great job. Do I suggest this course to anyone else? The answer is definitely YES !!!Thanks for such a great opportunity!
This course is really an interesting experience for me...although I've known Matlab years before. The course's material has been intriguing from the beginning, with the increasing difficulties until the final exercise. I've noted that for some exercises, the most difficult part is not the coding, but to understand the question and find the proper solution. The forum surely helps a lot in handling this difficult part, but for everyone who do the course in Coursera for the first time, it's like walking in the maze...haha..

The most inspiring quote for me is from Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick, programming is a humbling and often humiliating experience..should I write it on the wall?? maybe I should haha... 

Last but not least, thank you for Prof. Akos Ledeczi, Teaching Staff (sorry, I've only remembered Mr. Brendan Armstrong there, did I miss someone?) and all the Coursera team... 
Good Job and Thank you very much...
(1) lectures and example codes are good(2) assignments have some good questions that make student to become familiar with topics(3) some assignment problems are not clear. It is hard to even understand what the question asks. You don't know what to do until you have found a discussion post that a tutor explains what the question is. It will be helpful if the assignment could use more narratives and figures to make the questions clear to student.(4) Some later assignments are hard and may requires more thinking.(5) It is recommended to have an extra week/lectures videos on Object Oriented Programming. This topic can be optional/not for grades if it is too advanced for some students. However, it is good to have this topic covered in this course, as your lecture explanations are good and assignment questions are the best and optimal way for us to quickly master a topic.
was really such enriching experience with all it supplies with smooth explaining, helpful examples and mostly important funny problems from which I learnt a lot about how to to tackle a real problem and how to set up for the right algorithm. Programming is programming and the best way to learn it is by doing more and more exercises especially those involving real life problems as emphasized by the course. For all mentioned thus and more I would like to express how much I am fortune and how glad I am taking this course and follow the whole track up to the end passing all the assignments. Great thanks for Vanderbilt university, my heart thanks to Fitzpatrick and Ledeczi, and all who contributes to edit this wonderful course and I give a positive feedback and recommend all who wanna have such encouraging kick off and real boost in the field of programming.
Excellent  experience of learning Matlab Programming  and the course is elegantly designed to cover most of the concepts in Matlab. Through the video lectures and homework problems one can master most of the commands in matlabs.  Prof. Fitzpatrick  is the finest teacher I have come across, who made the course so interesting and made to look simple to understand which is not in reality. I never imagined that I could solve the homework problems and it was only possible by the Mentors guidance particularly Pauls posts. I take this opportunity to thank Prof Fitzpatrick, Prof Akos for designing such course which will be helpful in solving many scientific and Engineering problems and I am looking forward to use Matlab extensively.. Thanks to Coursera for providing the platform to experience the best course from the globally reputed University to many people.

For those students who have never learned MATLAB, this course will be a good introduction, ranging from simple calculation to simple I/O operation. Students may be able to do some little work with MATLAB after this course. In addition, this course has good-quality programming assignments with moderate difficulty. However, the depth is not enough, which makes me disappointed. Students can only get started after the course. If you want to go further with MATLAB, reading documents/papers, learning in working may be useful.BTW, I need Simulink's tutorial.
By showing me aspects of MATLAB that were new or almost new to me, this course has allowed me to delve deeper into MATLAB, and into programming in general, than I have done for a while now. While I have some past experience in its use, I was barely familiar with some of the more generic programming aspects shared by MATLAB as well as some of it's own characteristics. This course has allowed me to obtain what I hope is a decent grasp of these. I am therefore highly satisfied with the contents of this course and, if I had a suggestion for improving it, I would say maybe extend it to include some of the aspects of the book which are mentioned in the course but not covered as part of it. An alternative would be to organize a more advanced MATLA course that covers these, assuming such a course does not already exist.
Saying that this course is excellent is the least I could say. Lessons are clear and tidy, that way you can easily do homework tasks during the week each lesson lasts. The professor is really gifted, and mentors are very helpful, all my questions were answered with a maximum delay of 1 hour (this can be tricky for some time zones, but it is worth remarking).  A special mention for mentor Paul T Mielke who is particularly clear in his explanations, and gives just enough details for students to resolve problems on their own.  I recommend this course for beginners and people with some experience in Matlab that never took a formal introduction course (in this course you may learn easier ways to write your scripts, I know I did).  Thanks to all the team in "Introduction to Programming with Matlab"
The coursework is very intelligently compiled. Prof is super funny, he introduces each MATLAB feature at an appropriate timing, helping us learn the real importance and need for each feature. He doesn't allow the coursework to turn into a mere list of commands, functions and operators. It's like storytelling, and it's gripping. I spent my days and nights awake in anticipation to do one more assignment after each, finishing this coursework in barely 5 days. I also appreciate the fact that he picked examples that were picked up from practical world, so that we understand how to apply all the MATLAB skills that we've learnt in the coursework in real life also. It's rare to find teachers like him. I'm truly grateful I took this course. It's been a real pleasure learning from him.
Very informative course for starters. I have been using MATLAB for like small numericals and so but haven't used it for vast problems. But this course enables you to delve into those problems. Questions provided in the assignments are slightly on the tougher side (after HW5) which I think is difficult for the beginner to solve. Anyway thumbs up to Prof. Michael Fitzpatrick  for his thorough micro-level teaching. As he said.."lots of patience is required for generating a code". For some codes I have to run program around 40-50 times to get it right. So one need to be patient while solving the problems.  On suggestion part I would like the course organizers to give more information in problems. Some of the information is missing and can only be guessed which eats up more time.
A perfect course for beginners and also for those who wish to brush up their basics of programming in MATLAB. I personally benefited from the Structures, Cells and File I/O sections of the course. The explanations are so simple and lucid. I just loved the way Prof. Fitzpatrick delivered the lectures, with some fun elements infused on the go. I loved, how he drove all the way to the Library just to emphasize on a simple fact that MATLAB online saves its files on clouds. The quizzes proved to be extremely helpful in  establishing the concepts and providing a wholesome hands-on experience. Debugging some of the errors on my own was a good experience. The last three assignments were great, giving a subtle exposure to real applications like signal processing. Very Good!
This is the best course ever on MATLAB!!! Having compared this curriculum to other MATLAB Online Courses, I can confidently say this is the most detailed and professionally executed MATLAB Course. This is beyond introduction. Previously, I had zero knowledge of MATLAB but after completing this course, I came out professionally sound and certified. Although, I cannot claim to be a good programmer yet, but with time and practice utilizing the knowledge I have gained from this course, I will certainly improve beyond measure.I will advice anyone who really wants to learn MATLAB to enroll in this course without hesitation. However, prospective students should be prepared to put in a lot of efforts as some of the assignments need thorough research
pros: The lectures were very good and easy to understand. It gives us a scope for going deep into the programming with matlab.  The final assignments explain the value of matlab programming in real life application.cons: The assignments in the course are harder, its more than that of taught in lectures. One have to learn more than that is taught in the course to get a grip on the skill. They've covered the topics for the beginners and this will be a stepping stone for themI finally thank the vanderbilt  university for such a wonderful course presented. The lecturer was amazing with his explanation and his humor. I've definitely got a scope on my matlab programming skills and I'll look forward to create and find wonders in it.
Absolutely great course. He has a really good sense of humour and explains everything in a neat and understandable way.His style of teaching is very impressive. Though sometimes I have to watch it on x1.25 speed, the slides and code examples help with revision.One tip - do the programs. Pause the video. Do what it says. Create a new program based on what you learnt.He will be missed, I'm really sad that this course is coming to an end. I'm looking forward to other courses like this.The exercises are well prepared too. Even if you got full marks, please check with the given solution to ensure that you follow the best programming practices. The discussion forum has a very good mentor who helped me complete this course.
This course was a great and enoyable learning experience! I liked Prof. Michael's teaching style and the slides that Prof. Michael and Prof. Akos provided. I do know a few other programming languages, and I had taken this course to help me with MATLAB for Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.This course taught me that MATLAB is a lot more than just a Machine Learning language. The assignments towards the end were challenging and introduced me to the basics of image and sound processing. (And how simple they are in MATLAB!) MATLAB is a powerful language, and it makes solving complex problems simple (with help from the editor and debugger, of course). I hope I get many opportunities to use MATLAB in the future!
The course was extremely useful. I have always been scared of programming as I never respected it as a subject during my schooling. So, I was really in splits on taking the course. But turns out, I simply loved it. The pace, the examples and the mentor were all amazing. The assignments were smartly planned too. It taught me few function that weren't taught in the class. That's a very smart way of teaching. In my opinion, I would recommend this course to anyone( kinda an answer I give to Microsoft customer care!). Thanks people who were behind this.Edit1: Now that I'm a big fan of Prof.Michael Fitzpatrick, is it also possible for him to teach us OOPSs and other advanced concepts in MATLAB?!!!
I must say the professor's explanation is great. Although you feel that every assessment from midway through the course is impossible. But trust me, give it some it, some thought, you are going to make it. The teaching staff is also excellent. I got my answers very rapid. They are very helpful. Week 7,8 and 9 is long, which compensated because from week 1 to week 6 will be a smooth flow. A suggestion would be to constantly seek for help in the discussion forum and also see if you have the same problem that anyone else faced earlier and the staff answered it. This method makes the whole process a lot faster. THANKS to VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY and COURSERA!   Until next time, Adios everyone!
This in the best course on MATLAB Programming for beginners. The beauty of this course is the well framed Structure of the Course modules. Learner keeps on grasping things that are required in a systematic manner.Assignments given to the Learner are quite satisfying and important in terms of  Main Tutor Prof.Fitzpatrick  is quite energetic and motivating. Would like to see one more course on SIMULINK & Stateflow by the same Professors if its possible. Finally, I would sincerely like to thank Coursera, Coursera Community and last but not the least Profs. Mike Fitzpatrick & Akos Ledeczi for the excellent course which is benefiting  Students and academicians all around world.
Greetings!!!I'm
a student of mechanical engineering and I'm well aware of importance of
computers and computer programming in all fields of engineering - especially
MECH. ENGG.Computer
programming was always a topic which would grab my attention towards it anytime.
But I used to look at it as very complicated and must be requiring
higher prerequisites. But when I started this course all my confusions and
doubts were cleared.I know
this was just a small figment of computer programming, but with this
course a door has been opened to complete new world with lots of fun
and interesting things to learn.Thank
you all my dear teachers for making my learning EASY and FUN!
This course is really good. This course came handy for me for my post-graduation project. Because of this course now I can see or think through various aspects of the problem cause the solution is just lying there. Though I left this course in between cause I stuck on an assignment problem however I completed this course at last. Discussion forums are really helpful. Questions asked are quality questions. The answers or hints provided by staff are very well informed. They change your view of the problem. I really want to say Thank you to Mr.  Mike Fitzpatrick,  Akos Ledeczi, Brandon Armstrong (Teaching Staff) and the coursera team for this awesome course.
I really liked the course. It really forced me to use a lot of logical thinking in some cases. But, from one hand, this probably was one minor drawback of this course. I understand that it was mostly related to basics, but probably you can add more problems to Files IO in the future or cell and struct as well. Otherwise, sometimes I got a feeling that I was solving similar questions that were getting a bit harder from week to week. Nevertheless, great job! Thank you very much. I really liked that you are keeping forums from previous sessions, so you could gain a lot of different information that could actually help to solve question.
When I started this course, I literally had no idea about neither programming nor basic programming concepts.  But after completing it, now I feel confident that I can develop my own programs for transport modeling. It was a tough course but totally worth it. The coolest thing about it is that you can take it without having prior programming knowledge, but at the end of it, you will be able to do whatever you want to do. A BIG thank you to Vanderbilt University and to professors who run this course. They are people who know how to teach and how to transfer knowledge to others!!!Best regards,Filipp Zarov, Msc Student, KTH, Stockholm
To be honest this is one of the best courses available for Matlab. The content that was put together for this course was great and the assignments were the best part of the course and last but not least the instructors were great and Mike made the course really interesting with jokes in between the video lectures which didn't make the long video lectures boring and the mentors and forums were really helpful in clearing any doubts which I had. Also loved the little intro before each video lecture. Overall just loved the course and would really like it if there was advanced programming with Matlab from Vanderbilt University.
I love it because currently I am in a lab(on my fourth year of degree) and coming from a background with no basic programming skills, this course have helped me a lot to try to program and also learn about matlab more. I honestly can't say how much I appreciate this course for existing to help those people like me. Honestly, trust me, all those readings and searching on websites are not as helpful as this course. I wish I have all the money to learn everything I am interested to learn on cousera...  kudos to all the professors that invested their time and knowledge to help create something so beneficial like this..Love it!
This is a remarkably useful and interesting course. Its usefulness becomes more noticeable as you progress through the course and you can use what you have learned to solve problems the way you can think of, and realize that in real life there are problems for which, when creating a series of steps, (the one that suits you or that you like the most), after reasoning a bit, and by executing them, you can give them a solution.
Apart from this, the assignments are quite entertaining and challenging.
Finally, the teacher's ability to explain, in addition to his patience and humor, attests to his experience teaching.
Amazing course! Mike Fitzpatrick explains very well all the concepts covered in the videos and manages to make most of the material interesting. The overall structure of the course is well organized and makes sense. I gave 5 stars but hesitated to give only 4 because I find the assignments (especially at the end) too difficult. It takes ages to complete them, which is a problem for those who don't 70h to spend on this course. In addition, we don't have explanations and solutions for all assignments after completing them. Despite those issues, I really loved this course. Thank you Mike, Akos Ledeczi and team!
I am from biology background and used to have least interest in programming. But the Course is very good. The best instructors ever I can have. They started from scratch so that even a new one can understand. Gradually I got good hands in programming at least in MATLAB.The best part is the assignment. Brain storming assignments which were very helpful to learn the language. Also the mentors and instructors were great who were quick in responses to our queries. All that was very helpful. Thank you so much. I would appreciate if you can make such a great course with python also.Thank you.RegardsMegha Malhotra
Excellent course to learn programming. I do think it is necessary to make the problem statement more clear. especially the last problems are really hard to understand what they are asking. I would suggest adding some examples of what expected output one should get. That way the students can have a better idea of what they need to do to solve te problem. That will also save you guys having to answer too many emails about similar questions. Nonetheless, I am very happy i took this programming course. I now feel confident enough to challenge myself further in MatLab. Thanks for the pleasant experience
Amazing course! This was my first programming experience and both Mr. Mike and Mr. Brandon are extraordinary teachers! Lectures are great and the material is explained thoroughly, easily understandable, and with awesome jokes! The assignments are exciting because they are well applicable in real life and unveil the mystery behind some computer processes we often take for granted. This especially refers to the final tests: was so much fun to make my brain crush while doing them! I am so grateful to the Vanderbilt University for sharing so talented professors and such a wonderful course with public!
MATLAB is a very important software and computational tool for engineering students like myself. This course gave a great overview of all the basic yet crucial aspects of the language and MATLAB environment. The assignments were challenging yet not so difficult that they were discouraging. The instructor is also very engaging and has a unique content delivery style. I have certainly become a more proficient MATLAB programmer after taking this course and I urge all those who are interested in computation work or even those who want to learn the basics of programming to start off with this course!
A great course, offered by very good teaching faculty ( humourous too I might add) with easy understanding of MATLAB.It helped me a lot in also enhancing my critical thinking ability in last few assignments. Especially the second the last was very tough for me. But all in all it taught good problem solving skills and and will help in analysing many real world problems of physics. Now it's just a start but I plan on further enhance my knowledge using the textbook and other sources too.Great initiative and work by Coursera, the professor and forum team. Kudos to you guys. And a final Thank you
The instructor explained the core concepts in MATLAB very clearly, with delightful anecdotes and encouragements embedded throughout the course. As an intro course, the course contents and practice problems are rather simple, but they lead the way to more advanced problems and applications.One suggestion is that it would be even better to learn some more functions, especially ones that operate on matrices so that loops can be avoided or simplified. Many such functions are included in answers to specific problems, but still it would be nice to listen to the explanations from the instructor.
Wonderful Course, I enjoyed the lectures tremendously. The homework
problems were very useful and challenging and some of them took hours to program.
The gratification of getting âYour solution is correct.â    on the screen after working for hours is
just immense. It is clear to me that a lot of time and effort have been
invested in this course over the years. The course is a very valuable resource on
programming and MATLAB. Now that I am done, I will miss the lectures: from the
introductory music to the closing credits. But, most of all, I will miss the lecturer
himself, a true teacher.
This is an intro-level, beginner-friendly and an amazing course on Introduction to Programming with MATLAB. With this course, I have learned a lot on MATLAB as a programming language. Though it does not cover the entire MATLAB (only covers upto functions and file-handling), but whatever is covered has been taken in depth. This is certainly the best course to get started with MATLAB according to me.I am totally amazed with the course, and the way this course has been delivered, though virtually! Getting a free 9-weeks subscription to MATLAB programming adds more value to the course.
A year ago I hated programming MATLAB, I struggled a lot with my first semester programming classes,  my grades of  the first semester of university in programming class was 85; then I got this course, now I am first in my class, I got an 98 final grade of my second semester programming class,  I really enjoy programming, this course helped me with my confidence, my grades, my knowledge, now I am helping my classroom friends with MATLAB and I am really grateful for the opportunity to accomplish this great course, Mike Fitzpatrick is just one of the greatest programming teachers!
I am very happy to say that I have finally completed the course. I am programming from class 11 but in B.Tech now i wished to learn MATLAB. I am thankful to Vanderbilt University for fulfilling my wish. The Professor is very good in teaching, he explains really well.The assignments are really good problems. Assignments at beginning are easy but with the course it get difficult and most difficult are those 3 problems that are given in the final submission they really messed me. That was a nice experience. Hope I will again come soon to be a part of Vanderbilt University again.
I was familiar with MATLAB before taking this course. But when I started this course, I was gaining too much interest in this course. I learned too many techniques related to MATLAB programming. The way the instructor teaches its appreciable. If I would not take this course, probably I would miss too many things related to MATLAB programming. I did too many courses related to MATLAB, but this course is stand out from others. Lastly, I liked the Textbook.  I am strongly recommending this course to beginners. I can surely say you will learn a lot of things from this course.
This course gives me quite a good knowledge of Matlab programming, even in the introduction course you will get to know a lot of things about the Matlab programming through this course, like how can we deal with different array size with the ease, how can we solve the different real-life problems with the help of programming, and you will find that almost all the problems we can solve. Moreover, it's very fascinating and knowledgable for me. So, In my point of view, you can take this course and get ready to deal with a real-life problem with Matlab programming.
I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to take and complete the course. The professors for this class are phenomenal, especially with the youtube videos that go along with the lessons. By far one of the best classes I have taken in general, as it is a topic outside of my background and I was able to do well in the course. It is a very challenging course, and there are plenty of resources to succeed. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone trying to learn a computer programming language at all stages of your career. Thanks so much!
Far beyond my expectations, I didn't know anything about Matlab and computer programming. Now I know how to write a code to get my work done and save time. I remember what Mike Fitzpatrick said during the lecture sessions, that for solving a problem you should stick to it util you solve it, and most of the programming time is actually debugging and polishing the code. These statements were always encouraging me to solve the assignments and learn. The instructors were really helpful and Thanks to Brandon Armstrong for the prompt replying every time.
This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages. The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour. The assignments which comes later on can be a tad difficult for someone new to programming, but as the professor says , stick with it, solve it, and the feeling you get when you finish it is unparalleled. All the doubts and queries in the discussion forums are answered quickly and efficiently. Great course and a great experience over all.
Very interactive and useful information provided by lecturer. Thanks a lot to Mr. Akos Ledeczi
Professor
Computer Engineering  and Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick
Professor Emeritus
Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Neurosurgery, and Radiology who share their valuable information to me. I really used this information in my career growth.Again Thanks to lecturer's and University who recognised and awarded me valuable certificate. Also thanks to Coursera to provide me the platform where I can update my skill and knowledge.
Introduction
to programming with MATLAB itâs the beginning of the exploring process of two
wonderful worlds, the MATLAB world and the programming world. In a wonderful
way the professors Mike Fitzpatrick and Akos Ledeczi, took me from zero to a
great understanding of the basics concepts of programming using a powerful
program, they performed this course in a manner to explode your capabilities
both in the programming, as in the using of MATLAB, and the troubleshooting
process. Definitively one of the best learning experiences I ever had.
This is a great course. It starts from scratch, so if you have never seen Matlab, you can still follow along, because it does not skip essential basics such as what the different windows and such mean. After a while the assignments get pretty challenging though, but the forum provides a lot of hints in case you really get stuck. I learned a lot from this course. Thanks!I also liked the dry humor in the lectures.  The self deprecating "ironing my shirt"-joke in week 8 (?) was amazing, if you like that sort of thing...Best,Peter Vissers
This is a fantastic introduction course into MATLAB programming. The course is very well structured, delivers in-depth knowledge of the main fundamental skills needed to use Matlab. The presentations are concise and well delivered. During the homework help is always available at the tip of your fingers and it takes usually less than 30 min to get a response (even on the weekends... IMPRESSIVE).In addition, the recommended book allows you to delve deeper into MATLAB and I suggest you get that!In short, I highly recommend this course!!!
Although I had experience with programming from previous courses, this class definitely tested my skills and I came out learner a lot. My experience with MATLAB was quite limited to projects that I created for myself or through school, but this did a good job of expanding my knowledge and exposing me to a wide range of MATLAB's capabilities. Really glad that I found this class and was able to finish! Many thanks to the professors and teaching staff for putting this course together and providing ample resources and support throughout!
This course has really helped me in programming concepts and how the little mistakes we make or neglect, definitely affects us in the long run. Although you it might takes hours (especially me) before you could complete the assignment, solving through each and every step but when the green tick showed up, it was all worth it. Got little disappointed when the solution of tough problems were solved in just a few steps and it took me so much time. But still, each line of my program was a learning step for me. Thank you for this course.
I just want to thank Mike Fitzpatrick and Akos Ledeczi for this amazing course, that for me has been the best experience  I ever had, every day watching the videos, doing the homework. I don't have words to express what I really feel.I want to apologize too, because I don't have the money to pay for the certificate, I'm starting to work as a teacher  so I don't get pay well, but I hope later in the future I will be able to pay for it and even send you more money, because I know you did a lot of work to create this fabulous course.
This course helped me a lot! I started it when at the same time I started with my thesis project, in which I needed to use MATLAB. I only did 5 out of the 7 homeworks, but I saw all the weeks videos. This was because I felt that I had learnt what I needed for my thesis and the 5 homeworks were great enough for my thesis project. I appreciate that people like you share your knowledge and take the time to do this kind of courses.I didn't finish the MOOC (due to my thesis), but I will finish it after my Thesis defense.Regards,Jorge.
It was great for beginners or professionals from other disciplines who normally do not include programming in their bachelors. I am glad to have achieved and succeded the last week of this course with reasonable effort and satisfaction. Now, I am able to solve minor problems, check commands in other softwares and deal with neuroscience behavioral and electrophysiological issues I could not solve before. For a deeper knowledge of the application of Matlab to this field I suggest everyone to follow Mike X Cohen tutorials and books
This is a good course! Initially, I thought it will be a too simple course for me. (Because, as a student interested in financial engineering, I am already experienced in R programming and Python.) Then, I was admitted by Berkeley MFE and they required me to take a course in MATLAB. So I came to take this course. It turned out I like this course a lot! The professor is very humorous and good at teaching. This course renewed my knowledge about input and output and memory storage. I sincerely wish the producer of this course well!
This is definitely the best introductory MATLAB course, ever. It is also one of the top-quality courses in Coursera. Prof. Fitzpatrick is just one of the coolest, smartest, and likable professors I've ever had. I'm really grateful for Coursera and Vanderbilt for giving this opportunity to be in his class.One thing that could be done to improve the course, is to enhance some of the assignment to be more relevant to the content of the corresponding week. Some assignment didn't require the use of the concepts taught in that week.
Hi,Thank you very much
for the Matlab course on Coursera. It was really very interesting and you kept
me interested to the very end. It was not always easy (sometimes I needed help from more clever people then me on the Internet) but that does not matter,
the more difficult things in life are, the more worthwhile they are, as we say.I am not a future
programmer, I am 70 years old but my doctor told me to keep, together with my
body, the brain moving. Well, this course really did.Thanks again and take
care,Willem van Gogh
This is a great programming Matlab course I'd ever learned. The professor Mike did great on his lectures.  Weekly assignments were not many but not easy.  Especially, the assignments of the last two weeks (week 8 and week 9) were so time consuming and difficult.  Honestly, I wasn't able to do it and got help from Google search.  I wish the professor would have given more assignments, but the assignments would be constructed from easy level to hard level so that it could encourage me learning. Thank you the professor!
A very well designed course for beginners. This course takes you from the very basic to a stage where you will be able to instruct a computer to solve iterative problems or at least you will be able to counter them on your own, thanks to MATLAB documentation.  The Assignments are very well designed and those at the end of the course are very challenging (well.... at least to me for being a beginner) which encourages you to explore and built algorithms in MATLAB on your own. Thanks for providing this valuable course.
Loved this course. I was really put off of Matlab programming during college because I couldn't understand anything my professor was saying in terms of the functionality. While the explanations in these videos can feel like they are unnecessarily detailed, it was those details that filled in all of the gaps left by my previous professors. If I had videos like this while taking my college coursework, I could have been doing amazing things in Matlab by now. Thank you for putting this course together the way you did!
This course is thoughtfully designed and carefully structured so as to provide a through concept as well as first-hand experience of coding to any level of learners, especially the beginners. I myself had been introduced to and using MATLAB for some time now, but this course has redefined my idea about MATLAB about using it as an object-oriented numerical programming tool. Furthermore, I gained insight into the professional scriptwriting style and documentation both inside and outside of MATLAB built-in functions.
The best course which I would recommend for any of beginners in programming with MATLAB.  Though i had little experience in MATLAB while I am completing my M.Sc. course work, there I did not get an opportunity to learn the basic stuff. I had the thought of filling the gaps in my knowledge and followed the course. Actually, I learnt a lot and to the best level which anyone can have knowledge of the basics. Thank you Coursera and Vanderbilt university. Special thanks goes to chief instructor Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick.
This course covers all the basic knowledge you need to start programming in Matlab. This is an introductory course. It will definitely lay a strong foundation in Matlab. All the assignments are on a range of easy to moderate. I found the last three assignments a bit tricky and time-consuming. The instructors and support staff all are doing a fantastic job. The support staff is active and helps us during the course. I took this course before taking a Matlab course at my institute and it proved to be very helpful.
I greatly enjoy my time taking the course, and the professor's way of explaining the MATLAB codes throughout the course is good (esp. of his cold jokes lol). I cannot imagine that I registered the course during the first sem of my freshman year, and now I am entering into my final year of my college study. I cannot think of any better examples of how my procrastination is always switched on. But anyways, thanks to coursera and many thanks to the instructors. I hope that I can finish my other courses on coursera.
Prof.J. Michael Fitzpatrick is certainly one of the most engaging instructor and I'd straight up recommend this online course to anyone who not only aims at learning Matlab but also having a fun interaction with the course staffs who are kind enough to sit all day on queries and questions. I'd give a 6 star if I was handed an option just for how the course videos were produced and compiled and yes, I did tear a bit at the tail end of the course since prof.mike was an integral part of my routine the past month.
I was looking for a basic course on Matlab for a long time until I came across this one on Coursera. For every beginner who wants to learn Matlab, this is where you should start. Well paced course, with attention to minute details that would help every novice to not only learn how to code but more importantly how to avoid bugs. The difficulty of assignments rise gradually, which again is a sign of how amazingly this course has been designed. Kudos and thanks to the team of Coursera and Vanderbilt University !!
The course is well organized, and the instructor gives nice lecture and clear examples. The mentors are very conscientious and helpful, when I met troubles in homework and put them on the forum, the mentors answered my questions very quickly, which surprised me a lot! Some assignments in homework did struggle me for a long time, but when I finally solved the problems , I was ravished with joy just like completing levels in games! In a word, I really enjoy the process of programming with MATLAB in this course.
I've used Matlab for over 20 years, but I have never really tried to program with it. Truth is, I haven't really tried my hand at any programming after my first course in programming (C++). If I had taken a course taught like this one, I might be a programmer today! The lectures are entertaining and interesting, and the assignments are difficult enough that you have to do research (well, I did), which I believe is appropriate for a course like this. Than you for helping this old dog learn a few new tricks!
A very good course especially for beginners like me who don't know anything about the computer science the other computer science languages.  And I loved the course so much.  Thanks to the Professors for making the course  in the easier way.  And also Thanks to Instructor Brandon sir who helped me to find out the mistakes made by me.  Because of this course I have planned to do more courses related to Matlab and now I'm interested in learning other CS languages.  And now I'm confident in Matlab. Cheers!!
Very informative course. although I was using Matlab since last six months the course has added  learned lot of concepts in my programming knowledge.I have a suggestion as I'm a undergraduate mechanical engineering student, I use matlab for subjects like Numerical methods,CFD,FEM. So if you ca start a course on use of matlab in such streams it would be very helpful for students like me.Thank you Mike fitzpatrick (your teaching style is awesome!!) and Brandon Armstrong for helping me throughout the course
I had used Matlab for my other courses before I signed up for this course, so I came with a little background of Matlab to this course, with the purpose of solidifying what I knew about Matlab. To my surprise, this course has taught me a lot of concepts that I've never encountered before! And I like this course especially because they provide their answers to each question. It is so helpful to learn how to write neat code from others. The discussion forums are helpful too! I wish you enjoy this course!
I had no prior knowledge of MATLAB , and was in search of a basic course for the same.One of my friend referred me this course and showed me few of the videos .The teaching style instantly attracted me and in no time here i am enrolled for the course.There is no one in this whole world who can teach better for this particular course other than the one in the video.I am like super satisfied by the course and thank you for your hard work put in to make us learn MATLAB with ease.Lots of love from INDIA.
Excellent course for the introduction to programming and MATLAB!  The lecture is great and explains clearly though sometime it is a little boring. It covert a lot of details about MATLAB than the workshop taken at my home university.The disscusion forum is one of the best I have experienced at Coursera. The reply by mentors is so quick to make the discussion forum really helpful. The assignment is easy at first but it is a bit challenging in the end.All in all , I strongly recommend this course.
Very enjoyable, after finishing this course I am much more familiar with how to program in MATLAB, and feel confident that I can achieve anything I want to do with it. The course starts off gently, but gets relatively steep in difficulty towards the end. The lead instructor had a dry but funny sense of humour which helped me stay alert whilst learning, and the staff in the forums were very helpful. If you want to learn a bit about programming and/or learn MATLAB, this course is excellent!
I was a newbie to programming before this course. I took my time, re-enrolled several times in a time-span of 2 years and finally completed this course. I didn't delay completion because of lethargy, but because I was using MATLAB for my Masters thesis research, and hence learnt the skills when I needed them. It was fantastic! Professor Fitzpatrick has a very good sense of humor while his excellent grip on programming is apparent. I'm extremely grateful for this resource! Much love <3
Vanderbilt University and Coursera has offered a great opportunity to students who are interested in gaining an additional software skills. If you are a newly learner regarding computer applications, such a kind of will lead you to grasp the skill.  On the other hand, MATLAB is a newly developed programming language used to solve numerical problems in technical world. Lastly, I would like to thank Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick for teaching the course very swiftly and making me a MATLAB nerd.
Curso muy bien estructurado, con aprendizaje progresivo hasta obtener un nivel bastante elevado en las Ãºltimas semanas.Los vÃ­deos son amenos a la vez que Ãºtiles aunque los ejercicios son la base del aprendizaje de este curso.Lo recomendarÃ­a a cualquier perfil cientifico-tÃ©cnico que vaya a utilizar MATLAB a diario. Aviso: los problemas requieren de conocimiento matemÃ¡tico notable, por lo que si flojeas en este Ã¡mbito te costarÃ¡ bastante resolver los problemas en el tiempo estimado.
This was my first course on Coursera & I can say those 9 weeks were worth it ! The syntax of MATLAB and its various inbuilt functions were explained clearly by Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick. The assignments were relevant with a gradual increase of toughness towards the end. File I/O O/P functions couldv'e been explained a bit more in my opinion but overall it was a fantastic experience. I would like to thank Coursera and Vanderbilt University for making it available to us . Thank you.
It was an awesome journey, learning was made very easy and step by step counseling of Mike Fitzpatrick made it really interesting and programming with MATLAB was made enjoyable by him. I would thank VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY for giving a free course in such pandemic condition so that the time at home was made fruitful and help in improving MATLAB programming with the help of assignments and also provided their solutions so that i have multi concepts of solving a single problem
This is one of the best courses I have done so far. I am thankful to the entire team of Vanderbilt university and Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick for such an amazing course. The course content, delivery and specially Grader has been designed in a beautiful way that kept me moving with the flow and motivated me to complete all assignments. Hats off to Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick and entire team. Request you to please come up with course on Advance Matlab programming and Simulink as well.
I used to think MATLAB was strictly for engineering calculations (cos that's all I ever used it for in my undergraduate years), but this course has indeed shown me that there is so much more MATLAB can do. Professor Fitzpatrick's approach to teaching it is also makes it so exciting and easy to follow. This course has piqued the interest of the otherwise unwilling programmer in me. I am really glad it came my way, and I most definitely will be taking the sequel courses.
For me this was an excellent start using Matlab. The content was presented very concise and clear. The grading system is very nice and the homework assignments did match the increasing knowledge. Overall I really enjoyed this course and would therefor rate it excellent! Thanks to everyone how helped making this course possible.If I could state what I missed: I know this course is meant to be an introduction but a few more real application examples would have been nice.
If you never ever touch Matlab, but want to learn, then this course is for you. For years I had a Matlab book and pdfs training I never touch. This course give me the confidence to carry on. The teacher (in that instance Mike) is really good I teaching you how to use this software. I have to warn you that after lesson 5, it is really challenging and I spend even a day to find the solution. Do not let this to discourage you because at this end you will learn a lot.
I loved the course. But sometimes statements or sentences to explain the exercises are too difficult to understand for non-native English speaker (and that was especially noticeable in the last exercises, i.e., in week 9). The videos are pretty clear and pedagogical, but it would be quite good to improve those sections into the lessons. Lastly, I would also like to acknowledge the great work did by the Fitzpatrick professor: Congratulations, and thank you so much!
thankyou sir,, Introduction to Programming with MALAB is very interesting, in this course ,I have learned how to calculated different type of matrixes, plotting , how to use use functions , loop, image blur , saddle point ,echo genterator, and more many topics.finally , i want to say this matlab was very interesting because coursera metrial is enough to learn matalbvery very thankyou coursera , michal sir, and my college SAHARSA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING,SAHARSA
The last time I did computer programming was around 18 years ago with C++. I had almost forgotten the things. Since the programming language has been changed drastically in last 18 years initially , I faced some difficulties in coping up . But thanks to the aptly designed course content and unique teaching methodology of Prof. Fitzpatrick and assistance from Mr. Brandon that I could make it.This course will definitely be helpful for my research . Thank you !
Muy buen curso. Al principio parece un poco aburrido porque comienza con (lo que para mÃ­ parecen) cuestiones muy elementales. Pero poco a poco comienzan a surgir problemas mÃ¡s complejos y los Ãºltimos ejercicios ya requieren el nivel que esperaba del curso. Una excelente opciÃ³n para iniciarse (o reiniciarse) en Matlab. El libro que acompaÃ±a al curso trae material complementario y es una opciÃ³n recomendable. En definitiva, un buen curso introductorio a Matlab.
Excellent course to introduce yourself in programming language. Lessons through videos are really clear and explained as simple as possible; so nobody should have no problem, even without any preovious experience. Furthermore, the ebook offered by the teacher is very helpful and can improve your formation and solve some doubts. Tasks are quite challenging but you can learn a lot from them.I am very satisfied with the whole course and I strongly recommend it.
An informative and robust course for anyone wanting to better understand MATLAB and programming in general. The presentation and wit of Dr. Fitzpatrick is welcome as he eases you into the world of computer coding. Some topics were just grazed, such as structs and cell arrays, as well as file formatting, but the fundamentals were explored in great detail. Overall, it is an essential for better understanding MATLAB and anything involving computer programs.
This course is a very practical way of learning step-by-step this phantastic language and its environment. It also helps to learn some MatLab-way algorithmics. The serious and ironical at the same time style of Professor Fitzpatrick have made this course even more amusing for me. Challenging homeworks and accurate video explanations make this course great. I am looking forward you to make an advanced course and a Simulink one too if possible. Good work!
Amazing course! One of the best I've done in my life. Very well designed, structured and lectured. The subjects are divided in a manner that helps you improve in computer science from zero to where you need to go. But I think if you have some knowledge about program languages and numerical calculus it will help you improve faster. But it's undoubtedly how great this course is. Congratulations to Vanderbild University, Professors Fitzpatrick and Ledeczi!
The instruction was clear and to the point. The exercises were great, very informative and not overwhelming. Also, the length is perfect for an introductory course, enough to finish and build confidence fast. I recommend trying to write all the example functions for yourself during the lessons, it has helped me tremendously and I arrived at the exercises much more focused and ready. The forums seem nice, but I didn't use them much so I can only assume.
This is the first online course I've enjoyed from beginning to end. The lectures were fun and very informative. I especially enjoyed working on the assignments. They encouraged me to utilize everything I was learning in the lecture videos. I went from knowing very little about programming to writing functional and versatile codes on my own within a few weeks. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to get the basics about MATLAB.
It's a very well structured course with a balance of hand-holding, and being left to your own devices. The MATLAB online community, and external readings, are both incredibly helpful for debugging submitted code, and edging new users closer to better solutions, and ultimately, better code. The prof also laces each lesson with a helpful bit of dadjokery to keep you pushing through each assignment until you feel like you have accomplished something.
The routine of the course is so flexible to learners that they can complete the course in any manner they want. Professor of the course is funny and teaches you like a Beginner, which is good.  The syllabus covers most of the topic a programmer needs, so nothing to worry about it. I am looking forward to other MATLAB courses now. This course is definitely recommended if anyone wants to start using MATLAB,  it will introduce you to the atmosphere.
First of all, I am thankful to professor  Mike Fitzpatrick and Akos Ledeczi for their wonderful course structure and syllabus. professor  Mike Fitzpatrick explains everything in an easy and understandable way. And special thanks to Brandon Armstrong sir for his efforts and quick responses in the discussion forum. Before I ask any query, all types of queries had already been answered by sir, so we can see that replies and easily rectify problems.
I like this course very much.The way of  explaining  thins is good and innovative.Mostly I  like  Homework section, we know that Homework is stressful but I like pattern of homework which is motivating for doing homework.Although I enrolled very late I like this course very much.This course improves logical thinking but hard attention is needed. I would  like to attend other courses if release in future.Thanks A lot Professors and Mentors......
I have been using MATLAB for some time, yet this course did not cease to amaze me by teaching the fundamentals of the language. In fact, I am feeling that I did not know a few MATLAB basics before doing this course. I wish I had done this introductory course earlier to improve my programming skills. I am very sure that leanings from this one are going to help me in my career.p.s. - Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick is the coolest tutor I have ever seen.
Me ha parecido un curso muy recomendable y muy interesante para todos los estudiantes universitarios y quizÃ¡s de Bachillerato, aunque el nivel no es muy sencillo,  que necesiten hacer realizar cÃ¡lculos matemÃ¡ticos y programar funciones matemÃ¡ticas en general y en particular de  Algebra, CÃ¡lculo o bien que necesiten programaciÃ³n para resoluciÃ³n de problemas de FÃ­sica , QuÃ­mica u otras Ciencias experimentales que requieran de cÃ¡lculo matricial.
While stuck in quarantine, I thought I'd take this time to learn a new skill. Although online courses usually have a negative perception of being boring and ineffective, the "Introduction to Programming with MATLAB" course exceeded my expectations and delivered a myriad of interesting topics. Accompanied by detailed resources and challenging courses, as well as helpful and patient teaching staff, this course is definitely worth completing.
I'm really grateful to be one of you students doctor Mike . you taught me how to program a computer. you taught me what is data types and how computers stores data and how to access to this data by cells and how to connect with external world by file I/O and how to make loops and conditions and matrices and functions and you showed me how to plot functions and how to search for any function and many algorithms thanks so much doctor Mike
This is a perfect course for a beginner to start programming with MATLAB. The way, the instructor teaches throughout the course involving the learner is what a teaching should be like. The graded assignment at the end of several topics were very useful in developing a better understanding of the topic. Also the assignments at the end of the course were very challenging  and useful for testing what we have learnt throughout the course.
The course material was really good, they explain very clear all the topics, about the assignments I am not sure, some times it feels like they were asking for something ahead of what you know at the moment, also Matlab has too many inner functions that are very useful but you have to spend a lot of time looking for what you need. Overall the course is quite good and has helped me a lot in the development of my master thesis.Regards
This course is really awesome , i have never thought that  i would be able to learn MATLAB. But thanks to this course I finally achieve this . This course is really essential to those who might use MATLAB in future indirectly like in machine learning . This course really helps me  to solve the problems in an efficient way like solving problem through vectorization and etc.Lastly thank you to the whole team for providing this course.
This was a great course. I already learned a bit of MATLAB during my studies and enjoyed it at the time, but I found that I was lacking some core skills. This course was both entertaining and challenging at the same time. I recommended this course to a few people already! Although I'd say that you might need more time to solve the problems than stated in the course, but your milage may vary. Could be that I am just slow, too :-).
First, I would like to thank Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick and Mr. Akos Lebeczi for providing such a great Introduction to Matlab course. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is looking for a complete Introductory course for Matlab. Lectures are helpful and informative. I found them pretty helpful and I do recommend everyone to pay close attention to what Mr. Mike talks about. I hope you'll enjoy this course. Good Luck!!!
It is a pretty nice course that teaches me how to programming using MATLAB. MATLAB is quite a powerful tool that can help handle the data. When I was learning about image processing, I found that MATLAB is quite a handy tool for processing images. In order to learn how to use this powerful tool I took. I signed up this course. But the image toolbox is not covered enough in this course. Maybe I should take some other courses.
The course is very good for intermediate level people. Highly recommended for the people who is like me who thinks they know basics in matlab, but I can bet your will be stunned how many thing works which you didn't know previously. The last three assignments are horrible. I've spend at least full 4 days to complete them. But overall good experience. Recommended for people who know little bit matlab but wants to dig more.
Learning was never this fun, thanks to Vanderbilt University and Coursera. The course had high-quality content,  great instructors, and right on exercises.  I highly recommend anyone who wants to get a taste of MATLAB, its basic capabilities, and things you can accomplish using it, this should be your go. Overall the course was fun learning, and the power of MATLAB is immense just gives you head-on with your research.
It was awesome course for a beginner, though the course gets tougher as weeks pass on still the challenges are brainstorming and helps in developing problem-solving skills. discussion forum helped me a lot in completing my assignments whenever I go out of the track, especially during the final problems. on the whole I would recommend this course for a Matlab beginner with some beginner level of programming skills.
Initially I wanted to learn MATLAB for programming skills and try and understand MATLAB functions.I am glad I did this course and have almost got the sufficient benefits from this course. I am confident I can be more fruitful in my work and projects in coming future enhancing my skills further on. Thank you very much for this course and I ask everyone to take this course. You are going to get some real knowledge.
it have been a great course, i actually had a matlab course in my university, but this one is so much better and more challenging than the first couse at my university.i am extremely happy to have this course, because it brought back to me the love of matlab after that terrible course at my college.thank you all for your hard work, and hope i will meet Dr. fitzpatrik and the staff one day to thank them in person.
This course is a great introduction to programming. The homework can be a bit tough, as it will take the concepts taught in the week and have you apply them in novel ways, oftentimes in ways you have to really think through to solve the problem at hand. In doing this, you'll finish the course with a strong understanding of how to use MATLAB, and beyond that the know-how for learning other programming languages.
An umbrella package for the uninitiated as it starts from scratch and teaches you enough that you get the confidence to explore what MATLAB has got to offer apart from the syllabus covered in the MOOC. Very satisfied after doing this course and fingers crossed that that doing this course will be fruitful and I will be benefited by it.Thank you for this wonderful course that ignited in me the spark to code!
The course is really very good for beginners. If I had met such a course many years ago, I would have been a programmer a long time ago. After performing various tasks, I learned a lot. Thank you  Vanderbilt University, thanks lecturer Mike Fitzpatrick, thanks to all the other teachers and assistants. You do a very useful and good business for the community of novice programmers, scientists and engineers.
This course was an amazing experience! Lectures were simple an easy to follow, easy to understand and the examples given were easy to repeat. The level of the homework required patience. It was easy at the beginning, but it become more challenging every week. Once you have completed this course, you will feel that you have acquired great skills to start your programming career with Matlab. Thanks a lot!
This provides a great start to anyone who wants to learn MATLAB from ground up, whether if you have programming background or not. Examples are clear and explanatory. Quizzes are challenging. More people should do this course. The quizzes are progressively difficult, but definitely manageable. It is one of the better quality courses that exists on Coursera.If you are hesitant, try it for a few weeks !
I would like to thank vanderbilt university for providing such a 
wonderful course and i am much impressed by the use of the basic 
matrices in each and every programming purpose.thank you again!!!!:)))

Instructor of this 
course Mike Fitzpatrick is a very good teacher who encourage students to
 do something new and interesting.I really enjoyed learning this 
course and learned new skills in MATLAB.
A big thank you to everyone involved in the conception and development of this truly spectacular course.  The incredibly funny and intentionally goofy Mike Fitzpatrick made sitting through each video alot more enjoyable regardless of it's length.  Its without a doubt that the comprehensive and in depth knowledge provided by this course will benefit my post graduate studies as well as my career goals.
I have a lot of experience with Matlab, but I took the course to refresh (it's been 10 years) and for my LinkedIn profile.  The material was all very familiar so it is difficult to assess the level. But I found the lecturer was extremely engaging with an incredibly good, dry sense of humour.  And incredible typing speed ;-) The programming challenges were very well thought out in my humble opinion.
This is a fantastic course for beginners to learn how to use MATLAB. It teaches from the very basics to the more advanced concepts and has really allowed me to extend my mathematical knowledge into programming. My only issue is with the last 2 assignments being really difficult and hard to achieve a simple pass but other than that this is an exceptional course for anyone in the mathematical field.
I want to thank the course organisation and creation team and Mike Sir for bringing such a wonderful course in such a wonderful manner. It was like a roller coaster ride learning this course. The assignments were like games and at the same time they allowed us to apply what we learnt. I think everyone who wants to create an online course should learn the way this course is designed and organised.
Coursera has been a platform for people who has interest to learn new things and want to upgrade their carrier. Coursera helped me a lot and this course has given me a broad knowledge of Matlab and it was fun to learn with coursera and had a very worderfull experience to learn this course and at last but not the least lecturers were good and had a very good learning experience to learn from them.
Although this course is basic, it provides good foundation and knowledge for further study. Many thanks for the instructor, all the mentors and classmates on the weekly homework discussion forum. Without their help and inspiration, I couldn't finish some of those challenging homework questions. And thanks for this MOOC platform (Coursera) to provide me an opportunity to learn such good course.
The teacher is of the highest standard, finally someone who can make the complex, simple and interesting! One of the best planned courses I've seen, this is a course definitely worthy of a fee. What I've learnt in the first 4weeks is beyond what I learnt in 1yr at university. Makes such a difference having a teacher that goes the extra mile to make something complex into easy. Very impressive.
This is very much interesting course.The instructor who conducted this course is so much friendly as i felt like he is a my close friend.For everyone those who are seeking for knowledge about MATLAB this will very much helpful as a beginner.But make sure to have a little bit  mathematical background before starting the course specially about matrices.Good foundation to be a MATLAB programmer.
"Introduction to Programming with MATLAB" provides me a strong basic understanding of MATLAB. The lectures are easy-to-understand, plus levels of assignments are suitable. Apart from MATLAB, this course gave logical algorithms, problem-solving skills, and basic mathematics. I recommend this course for those who want to quickly learn basic MATLAB while having experienced in other programs.
For a beginner, this course is simply superb.They will teach right from the scratch, and they will execute every command in matlab.The assignments are really good. The assignments are like open book exam,we have the documentation for every command ,still we have to work hard and have to think smart.Finally, i am very much satisfied with this course. Eagerly waiting for more such courses.
Really lovely presentation and examples. Loved the encouragement and gentle humor throughout. My only possible criticism (and I'm sure this was an intentional choice) was that it can be very frustrating in the questions to get something wrong, but not see enough of the tested inputs to understand why. Overall, an excellent course to grant familiarity with Matlab and the tools to do more.
This is a very interesting and Challenging course which really opened my eyes to see the great possibilities that can be achieved through programming. The tutor was absolutely excellent and the progression of the course was superb.My most interesting and Engaging part of the course is having to tackle the numerous weekly assignments. Thumbs up to the whole crew from Vanderbilt University
No other course explains the programming concepts better. It is explained from a ground up method, giving us the proper foundation. Each and every topic covered in the course was explained in detail, just what an amateur programmer needs. The knowledge of Mike Fitzpatrick is extensive but he doesn't bore us with the excruciating details. Five stars for Mike Fitzpatrick's sense of humor.
A really good for diving into the world of computer programming with MATLAB!. A nicely paced course with lot many examples and assignments to test your understanding. Only gripe is that few of the vedios  are  a bit long and few of the assignments are on the difficult side , you need the help of the internet to solve it. Otherwise this is a really great course in understanding MATLAB!
This was one of the few courses I enjoyed doing - both during the lectures and the assignments. Some of the lectures are long (around 1 hour), but Prof. Mike makes them so interesting that I hardly noticed as the hour passed by. The assignments get harder towards the end but also much, much more fun. At the end of the course I was able to do much more than I expected to be able to do.
The course was easy to follow; the exercise problems were neither too easy, nor too difficult to make you crash out of the course. The textbook suggested for this course goes into more depth and is absolutely recommended for beginners. Prof. Fitzpatrick's folksy humor inspired me to keep going whenever I felt demotivated. I am looking forward to more courses from Prof Fitzpatrick.
Absolutely loved the way this course was taught!!. I would recommend this to anyone who is new to programming and wants a clear understanding of fundamentals. The course content was presented articulately and was quite fun to work to work on the assignments. Though I found some of the assignments towards the end to be challenging, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of working on it.
It's a very well organized course. Anyone who doesn't have any prior knowledge can start this course and can learn from scratch. This course will guide you step by step to become a MatLab programmer. All the course contents are very easy to understand and can be implemented after learning. If you are looking for a complete and detailed course on MatLab then this course is for you.
It was a challenge and an excellent experience overall. The learning experience was made interesting by continuous assignments and certainly the wit and humor of Dr. Fitzpatrick added a completely new dimension to the overall experience. I would like to thank Coursera and the faculties of Vanderbilt University for this amazing opportunity to learn MATLAB and its various functions.
This was quite possible one of the best taught classes I've even taken, on Coursera or at a University. The teacher does a fantastic job of explaining concepts well and setting up online exercises that you can work through. You wouldn't think programming would be easy to teach online, but they did a great job here. Highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn Matlab.
I'm a postgraduate student and I'm working daily on Matlab. I'm actually grateful for this chance to hone my programming skills in Matlab, the course was full with basic steps to deal with many real problems, in addition there were also some tricks that I learnt here. I believe it is one of the best courses that teach programming skill and the logic behind solving basic problems.
Great class! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging. My only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand. If those questions can be described in more plain English, students can solve the problems faster. Nevertheless, the discussion forum is very helpful since all of my questions have been asked and answered.
A very fabulous course. Best for those who want to have a taste of programming and that too in one of the most dynamic software MATLAB. Course contents are totally up to the mark and the instructor makes the sessions even more interactive and full of learning. Assignments range from basic ones to advanced ones which requires good command over learnt topics and lots of practice.
This class was amazing. I finished all of the problems and I think I learned a lot about programming over the course of 3 months. My company uses MatLab for data processing and I needed to learn the basics to understand what is going on. The automated grading is a really nice tool. I feel very confident going forward. Thanks for an awesome course!Education background:  BSc, MBA
I had basic knowledge of matlab before starting the course which helped me to complete this course before time. I really loved the way, this course is organized. I didn't know much about function building but this course allowed me to practice different approaches to a particular problem. Assignments allowed me to understand things even more. Overall it was an amazing course
It's a fantastic opportunity for any beginner to programming, especially with matlab. The structure of the course is highly adequate and well organized. The topics are carefully selected. And the assignments are designed in a way that makes it get more challenging while you go through the course, and effectively help practicing the concepts introduced in the video tutorials.
A brilliant course for both beginners and experienced programmers. The professor carries along with a steady pace and has made good problem sets to increase learning. His lecture style is so inspiring , informative and sometimes funny that i find myself spending most of my time in this course. Hope people at Vanderbilt continue to produce such valuable courses in the future.
Really good course. The lectures were paced a little more slowly than I might have preferred, though it did allow me to get completely comfortable with everything that was presented. The homework problem sheets were useful, challenging, and a lot of fun.Having completed all of the problems, I can approach may of the problems I can use MATLAB to solve with some confidence.
A great course to learn MATLAB. I had lab experience in programming with MATLAB at school, but this course has though everything needed to be a good programmer . Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick is a very humours person , he will make this course more interesting and less boring with his jokes. He teaches great. I request the team to bring in more courses on electronics branch too.
Very good course, it has some really mind blowing problem sets. I found completely different ways to solve them, and that was amazing.Week 9 assignment should be little bit easy or else more information should be provided in the lecture. Overall I really enjoyed the course. It just build my foundation and rest depends on me. Thank you coursera for providing this course.
Really a nice course I will personally recommend every single student interested in programming to join this course and learn MATLAB, because it will only add up  to your asset and is really taught in a simple and fully covers the basics with lot of assignment Questions .Thank You Professor for your valuable teaching , Thank you course Era for such an incredible course.
This course is great for beginners. Whole courseplan is arranged with precise &  required pace. You will be able to gain introductory concept of Matlab in the best possible way. Course instructor is very good & seemed to have a deep experience and knowledge in this field. Would recommend the course to all those peoples who are enthusiast to get into Matlab programming.
It was amazing and worked pretty well for me. Before taking this course I had a vague understanding of programming. But after taking this course (plus practicing hard myself) I had improved so much that I started writing the control program of a parallel robot. So I would really recommend this course (especially for those with less previous background in programming ).
This is a great course if you want to learn Matlab from the basics. I have no programming experience at all and was absolutely illiterate in programming languages and could make it. The best way is to keep on track till the prgramming exercises and than use the Forum to ask questions. The Mentors are providing great support and always very timely. Thank you very much!
This is an outstanding course.  The programming lectures are indeed introductory, but this is not your  'hello world' introduction to programming.  The problems are very challenging.  But when you solve them you will be immensely rewarded.  I suspect that most people who take this course already have a lot of programming experience.  For those who don't, I admire you.
Most of the concepts are explained very easily, and some assignments are little bit challenging but it worth doing by yourself. However, I take some help from others in 2 of my assignments for understanding the problem but at the end of the day I learned a lot. Well, all thanks to Coursera and the creators of this course for making it so interesting and informative.
I've been thinking to take a course on matlab since a longtime but couldn't take one due to many reasons. I've finally taken this course and I must say that I am now confident that I am well versed with the working environment of Matlab and can work on it now. Sincere thanks to all the people who helped in building the course and special thanks to Mike for teaching.
I think the assignments could be made better by introducing the predefined functions as a lot of time was put in to find out the functions to use. And the time given to complete the assignments is very less. perhaps decrease the number of questions from 8 to 6 would definitely help. I had to extend the course 3 times as i could not complete the assignments on time.
Great introduction to programming using MATLAB. Prior to this course, i had very little programming experience. This course has helped me to understand more on how algorithms work and i can't wait to keep on improving myself. The last week examples and questions were the toughest for me. But glad i scaled through and can move towards machine learning using MATLAB.
As a beginner, what I needed was someone to direct me and a platform to practice, which I get here at Coursera in collaboration with Vanderbilt University. And, of course anyone with internet access can join the course for free and learn here (unless you need certificate, for which you will have to pay). Thank you very much. I will continue to join such programs.
I just cannot describe the usefulness of this course. Although, it is called ''Introduction to programing with MatLab", it takes you from zero to hero literally.  At the end of this course, there are three challenging real-life problems; solving these problems gives you the impression that you can do something with the knowledge you earned. Thank you VANDERBILT
It was an amazing experience. I have learnt a lot about programming of MATLAB from this course. I am very much happy with the course content created by Akos Ledeczi and I just love the technique of teaching of the Instructor Mike Fitzpatrick. I hope to work with you people someday and I am very much grateful to both of you and your entire team for this course.
I think professor fitzpatrick is one of the best professor in the world. All the section was very easy to learn and they was so helpful for me. All the sections were full of informative points. I think the class was so funny  with the jokes that were said. At the last, I miss this lesson and this professor so much and I'm sad that it's over. Wish you the best.
Firstly I should thank prof. Mike Fitzpatrick because the way he explains made me listen to his lectures he is very student-friendly & a little humor in the class which makes me more interesting and the content was very good.Finally thank you  Akos Ledeczi, Vanderbilt University for providing this course in a good manner I mean the video & background effects
Completely worth to take this course if you are a beginner in programming language or if you want to build a career in MATLAB programming.Every small aspect is explained so precisely , hence at the end of this course you will feel enough confident.Thank you to the whole team of this course , especially to Mike Fitzpatrick sir,, I wish to  meet you soon sir .
This is a good introduction to MATLAB programming. The lecture is clear and I believe that it is suitable for anyone who is interested, even for those without programming background. The tutorials are easy at the start but it gets so much more difficult towards the end. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in MATLAB programming.
I am enjoying the course literally and the way it has been taught by the lead instructor is extremely good, His way of teaching will never get you bored during the lectures. I request to the course organizers and instructors to come-up with the advance version of this course with same instructors. Thank you Coursera for giving such a wonderful experience.
This course deserves 5 stars because the teacher is very thorough. He and his team really put a lot of work into creating an excellent course for beginners. I found it tedious in places because I came to the course with a lot of previous programming experience. This course covers basic programming and MATLAB. I did learn what I need to learn about MATLAB.
This course will give you a lot of tools and insights to handle many programming problems using MATLAB.  Its content is really interesting and of high quality, despite being just an introductory course. Professor Fitzpatrick is really funny in each lesson and assignments led you to do your best. Thanks a lot to the instructors and Vanderbilt University.
This course is one of the best programming courses out there on MATLAB programming, and also one of the best courses for someone who is new to programming. I highly recommend people who are looking for courses to start programming or to people who are looking for courses on MATLAB as this course provides a great overview on the concepts of programming.
This certification course was awesome and i want to state that by solving the problem statement i really learnt and enjoyed a lot . thank you for organizing such course and approving my financial aid . Hereby , i will try to enhance my coding skill on this language , also i am grateful yo coursera for giving the course for free with such rich content .
I couldn't have enjoyed this course more.  The lessons were very well done and the information was presented in a manner that makes it easy to retain.  The programming assignments gradually became more and more difficult, but I felt that they really helped me learn MATLAB and gave me a solid programming foundation.  Awesome course and highly recommend!
An excellent course with easy-to-follow, very logically built up and useful topics. The presentation style of Professor Fitzpatrick is amazing, he makes even complex things clear and easy to understand, and he makes sure the audience does not get bored at all. If you need to get a solid base in programming and/or using MATLAB you MUST take this course.
Es un curso muy bien
diseÃ±ado para que el estudiante aprenda y a su vez se divierta con las
asignaciones. Es increÃ­ble la facilidad con la que se explican los temas,
incluso sin tener nociones de programaciÃ³n se puede comprender los temas muy
bien. Disfrute cada asignaciÃ³n y aunque algunas fueron un tanto desafiantes fue
una experiencia muy agradable.
I find this course very informative and useful for the person who is new to MATLAB programming. The course has helped me build the basics for MATLAB programming. The course is well designed and beautifully explained by prof. Mike Fitzpatrick and prof. Akos Ledeczi.  I am grateful to the professors and Vananderbilt University for providing the course.
Thank you very much, Mike, I thoroughly enjoyed your class. I really appreciate your patience and clear explanation of each and every detail of the MATLAB code. I could able to follow your outstanding teaching and hopefully, I will utilize this experience in solving practical problems that I am going to work on.Thanks again!!Sincerely, Nagaraju Dande
Unbelievable course. The lectures, ebook, homework, and help/feedback in the forum make this an elite learning experience. The course assumes little or no knowledge of programming, and only basic math concepts. I'm so grateful to the instructors who made this course, as it is given me the foundation necessary to take the next steps into data science.
Clear Explanation. Good for people without programming background. But MATLAB has very different syntax in some cases from other popular languages. (eg. array index starts from 1 but not 0) These are quite annoying. That's not the problem of the instructor of course. The instructor gives very good lectures! The homework problems are also interesting!
I think this is a very good introduction to MATLAB. The course was a bit too slow-paced for me, but I think that's totally fine. The assignments were also challenging. Just the last assignment should be reconsidered as, without any knowledge of audio signal, it's pretty hard to even find where to start. But overall this course was very informative.
This course was quite helpful to renew my knowledge on MATLAB and even learn new skills. It forces you to be creative, stick to practical thinking and elegant solutions rather than to lose yourself in endless lengthy loops. I find it very important to be concise when handling matrices, especially large data arrays, so this came in very handy to me.
As the title says, the course focuses on computer programming, or the 'matlab' language. Using this as a tool for learning/doing mathematics is not covered in this course. However, this course is really essential in appreciating the 'matlab' language and of course the documentation is great, so you can easily solve differential equations and stuff.
This course is a very basic introductory lesson for beginners who have no previous experience with MATLAB or programming. I really learnt a lot basic knowledge from this course. For people who already knows programming or has some experience, this course will be too easy and you should move to more advanced class. Many thanks to the instructors!!!!
Thank You sir for explaining each  problem in detail and also a big thanks for giving hints over the problem when I went the wrong paths.This course looks easy and is. But toward the end when the real world situation problems are given the code may be simple but we have to put all my knowledge to clear those assignment.The was good and enjoyable.
The course is very informative and it takes you from basics to advanced in gradual manner. The assignment problems are really good and challenging. It is a must course for those who want to use MATLAB as a tool for doing projects in various domains. I am using MATAB for mechanical engineering applications. Thank you for such a wonderful course!!!
Great Job. It is really a wonderful course. I has very useful information and practice exercises. The book also is easy to read and understood . Thanks so much for this course. Thanks for all instructors and mentors reply on forum. They were always there for support.   I hope you can arrange another series of this course for advanced programming.
This course is just excepcional! From a point of view of a person who had just a few experience em MATLAB, I'd say that it helped me a lot. I learned a lot of new things and I'm very thankfull. However, I must say that some exercises are, let's say, too hard for people who had few experiencies on programming. Anyway, thanks for the great course!
Excellent course. Particularly the problems of the last week are quite interesting and they test all the skills learned during rthe course. These problems are very helpful for all those who intend to take up image processing, signature analysis, AI and process automation. I extend my heartfelt thanks for teaching me new skills of a new language.
i do recommend this course for every engineer, MATLAB is a nice tool that helps you analyzing and evaluate your project. The material throughout this course is handy and easy to understand with those great stuff. But the programming assignment was hard especially the last two assignments.Thank you very much, you make my engineering life better .
Very good Introductory course for MATLAB. And it provides license for accessing the online version of MATLAB, which means you could use it to practice.The only unsatisfactory should be that some videos are too long. Maybe it's a good idea to use more exercise with a cheat-sheet and a after-practice explanation on confusing points in the course.
Hello every one before starting the course i have zero knowledge on matlab i don't know basics also but i successfully completed the course now i have an confident that i know about mat lab i can confidendently attend for the interviews regarding mat labthankyou coursera team for providing  this wonderful courses  free and encouraging students
Excelente contenido y problemas a resolver muy interesantes y retadores, algunos se complican si se leen bien. AprendÃ­ a usar mejor la herramienta con conceptos que desconocÃ­aExcellent content and problems to solve very interesting and challenging, some are complicated if read well. I learned to use the tool better with concepts I didn't know.
This is an excellent course to start programming. Professor Mike Fitzpatrick is awesome teacher. The way he teach is really amazing, it never feels just like a lecture video but the way he teaches gives the realistic feeling of being taught in classroom. He made learning programming fun through his lectures and the contents are also fabulous.
Mike is very detailed in his discussions and examples during his lectures. The occasional humor that he injects during his lectures makes the subject matter less boring (sorry for the lack of a better word) to listen to. This course definitely laid down the necessary foundation that I need to learn to get me up and running with using Matlab.
This is a phenomenal course and absolutely recommended for those who don't know anyting about coding. You will appreciate the teachings of Dr. Fitzpatrick and the assignments are perfectly graded and challenging. Only one issue that the last two assignment questions(echo_gen and img_blur) ,in my opinion needs to be more elaborated and clear
Excellent course!!! I had learned MATLAB before but this course really opened my eyes to see MATLAB  for what it truly is, a programming language! My previously shallow understanding of MATLAB has been very much deepened, and I am very grateful for that. 100% recommend! The bits of humour during the lessons made it all the more enjoyable :)
The course is very well organized. I learnt a lot of things in MATLAB programming. The assignments are really good, sometimes tough also. The video lectures are very useful in solving the assignments. The videos are just the perfect blending of theory and programming. Nice course by Vanderbilt University. Thanks to the Professors and team.
Its very fantastic course with good teaching and real time practises. Its be a great challenge to complete this course.I believe that it will help me to start a new career in my life. this is beginning for me and do a lot of hard work to improve my skills. thank you very much coursera for giving wonderful opportunity during COVID lockdown.
It is really help full course for us as we become more familiar with programming and coding in Matlabi learn many more function and use of then through this course which will reduce time required to get work done. i am also thankful to Mike Fitzpatrick for explaining all lesion with such easiest way.Again thank-you so much to all relevant.
Very good course as an introductory. Covers basis of programming using MATLAB. The content is very interesting and useful because it shaped a strong basic of MATLAB and make it easy for anyone to finds its own way to go deeper. This my second time as a revision and to complete the Course because last time I have watched  downloaded videos.
Amazing course!!! This is my first time trying a web-course and also the first time for programming. The lectures are well-prepared and clear. The homework is challenging but not impossible, which enabled me to learn a lot. The friendly mentors response my questions fast and in details, which makes me feel supportive. Highly recommended!
A really good course, the instructor explains everything to you down to the smallest details, giving example to everything, the assignments are pretty balanced, giving you a good test for what you learned without being insanely difficult for new learners. I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn programming from scratch.
From being an absolute novice about programming nine weeks ago to knowing something about the same topic now feels great. The course content and the way everything has been put together is awesome and very easy to understand at the same time. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with little or no knowledge of programming.
I enjoyed how the course is structured and how assignments are prepared to encourage learning. It helped me to find the gaps in my knowledge. I learned MATLAB specifically for my research projects (lots of time-lapse image analysis). With this course, I feel more confident with my programming skills. Thank you, Vanderbilt University!
I have thoroughly enjoyed this course, thank you! Some assignments are meant to be more challenging, but they are great ways to put what you've learnt to practice and build your programming skills. The topics of the assignments are diverse which gives you a sense of how broadly MATLAB can be applied to different problems and fields.
The course is very helpful in learning the software. It is learner friendly as teacher gives so many examples to make understand the syntax. The course not only enhances software skills but also gives an insight on theoretical concepts. It make different concepts on matrices clear. Last but not the least, Course is very much helpful
This course is a satisfactory one for those who might be trying coding first time, but it is the best course of MATLAB that one can start with and provides all the basic overview as well as detailed parts of programming, and also shows real life problems. It's assignments also cover all the possible problems of real life problems.
I haven't finished the course yet, but I can certainly already say that it is excellent. Prof. Fitzpatrick's pleasant Southern pace and humor â along with the well-structured course design â make this a winner for anyone interested in learning how to use Matlab, as well as a good introduction to basic concepts of linear algebra.
Perfect course for a beginner who wants to learn the basics of MATLAB. There is no need to have any prior knowledge to programming either, one can just start learning. i recommend engineers or programmers or anyone with a curiosity to study this course as this skill has a vast scope and can come in handy with many applications.
This course was very useful and interesting for me, I could not break from studying it. With each new task, more and more wanted to solve the problem. The video lectures were especially interesting and most importantly not boring. I want to thank everyone who made the effort to create this course, you have done a very good job.
Excellent course even for student without any programming foundation!Sometimes,the Professor's way of teaching has been very interesting and impressive :) . It has really opened a door for me to learn computer science as one of my hobbies.Looking forward to other courses concerning How to use Matlab to build  mathematic models.
I really liked Professor Mike Fitzpatrick's way of teaching and explaining each topic. He made the programming language quite easy to understand and use. The assignments also helped me to progressively grow my knowledge and do well in the submissions. Overall I liked this course and I would recommend other students to take it.
I have just started with coding for my future project on robotics. MATLAB is very powerful tool and this course give a good introduction about MATLAB. I learned all concepts and completed with all assignments. Some I solved easily while some assignments took time. Some assignments challenges your learning which I like the most
I am forever grateful to you for letting me have this course. I have been benefited a lot by this. The course is structured very well for a beginner. There is a brevity of time, however, this course covered many topics and suggested reference book names for other important topics. Thank you Vanderbilt university and Coursera.
Best for the beginners. I undertook the course to brush up my basics and it was highly useful. Kudos to the team for bringing out the best material for MATLAB on the web. The assignments were really good. I hope the team comes up with Advanced programming with MATLAB that will be useful for the professionals in the industry.
A very well constructed course with assignments that challenge the student's problem solving and Matlab acquired knowledge enough, without being too too much above the needed level. Highly recommended, as well as viewing the discussion forums which is filled with the same questions that you'll have throughout the curriculum.
Excellent course with wonderful explanations and illustrations. The team handling the grader technology has done a very good job too. Last but not the least, the forums for discussions have been eye-openers in the case of a few problems. The mentors have promptly replied to queries in the best possible way. 
5 stars from me.
I totally recommend this course. This course includes Euler inspired project exercises which I found are very interesting and challenging problems. I believe the recommended book is hidden jewel which together with the course make you a strong Matlab programmer. In general, this course is a strong Matlab programming course.
The professor MIke Sir is a brilliant instructor. I could only stick to his lectures this long because his way of teaching is very unique, and the little humor that he adds in between is just amazing. Thank you sir and of course the entire team that developed this course. I am way better at Matlab now than I was before.
This course has helped me tremendously to enhance my coding skills in MATLAB. The instructor Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick is really a good teacher and deals with the course in a very interesting manner. Thank you very much for offering this course in this platform. I indeed had a good time learning the basics in programming.
It's a great course for using MATLAB as a programming language for the beginner. The best part of it was the Homework Problem. It provided me great sense of achievement after completing the Homework set 8. Thank you Vanderbilt and Coursera for the opportunity of learning this course while staying in Nepal. Thank You!!!
The programming lessons have been planned meticulously. Even for a beginner, it is very easy to follow. The programs are challenging and verify the breadth of the skills developed. I really gained a lot with this course. Thanks to the course instructor, university and the Coursera for providing this excellent course.
It is mandatory to those students who are going or are willing to go in an engineering university. I have already referred this course to my younger sister. When I was entering in an engineering university, I did not know about the MOOCS. One thing more, the tune for this course is awesome like the course instructor.
A great MOOC, excellent content and assignments that really help you master programming with such a powerful language like matlab. I highly recommend this course to anyone involved in mechanical or electrical engineering and has little or no experience with matlab. A warm hug to everyone who help create this course.
The course was a wonderful learning experience. Personally, I found the exercices stimulating and helpful in applying the concepts learnt in the course. I enjoyed the algorithm building for some of the more challenging problems in the assignments. I recommend this course to all the beginners willing to learn MATLAB.
It is an amazing course to get started in MatLab. The last assignment problems are really amazing they will test if you've really learned what is taught or not. The teacher is very experienced so the course is not just about writing code but he also teaches how to get things done and some jokes keep the mood fresh.
Thank You Coursera for helping out a student like me.This course has enough material to get you started and the assignments given are really fruitful in understanding the concepts taught well.I would personally recommend this course to any one who wants to start with Matlab as this course delivers enough to start.
This course is AMAZING, start from basics and the homework makes you think a lot! The classes videos are very interesting showing the concepts and giving a lot of examples (with a bonus of couple jokes, the professor Mike Fitzpatrick is very good!).Thanks Vanderbilt University and Coursera for this great course :)
Brainstorming assignments which tease your brain accompanied with detailed explanation by Mike sir and his humorous teaching method which never makes us exhausted or sleepy in his lecture. There is a clear transition seen in me after I completed this course compared to that before I joined this course.Farewell!!!
Curso muy bueno y muy completo, muy bien explicado y estructurado, con buenos ejercicios que ponen a prueba tus conocimientos adquiridos y que te hacen progresar rÃ¡pidamente y viendo aplicaciones reales que en un primer momento quizÃ¡ no llegaste a pensar. Enhorabuena por haber desarrollado este excelente curso.
This course is one of my favorite.  The instructor has given all for this course the style of teaching is magnificent. If you are a novice in programming, you'll never find a better course than this. The level of teaching has been set to very fundamental and basic to high level. Thanks for designing this course
If you have no any Experience of the programming language than I strongly commanded this course because of this course contains all fundamental ideas of MATLAB and Prof. Mr.  Mike Fitzpatrick gives detail knowledge of MATLAB in this course. Also the exercises is very useful for getting idea about of functions.
This course was very useful to me .I learnt MATLAB in a very simple and effective way. Thanks to the instructors for this wonderful course. I loved their way of teaching. The Discussion Forum is also very active and informative. Most of my doubts were cleared by reading threads of other classmates discussion.
It's a great course with very challenging assignments.All the assignments cover most of  the concepts that needs to be covered  along with on demand discussion forums.I personally liked the course a lot. It helped me explore variety of concepts that a MATLAB can do.Thank you for providing such a great course.
It was an amazing course about understanding the MATLAB language and it's uses. The instructor sure has his unique way of teaching things that helped me grasp the key aspects in a very amazing manner. 10/10 would heavily recommend to anyone planning to get into the MATLAB environment. Thank you so much guys.
This course guided me on my first (somewhat clumsy) steps in MATLAB in an informative, easily comprehensible and fun way! It absolutely motivated me to get deeper into it! Short: one of the best online courses I've ever attended and definitely worth recommending!@authors: thank you so much for your effort!
Did struggle to understand the instructions for the final assignment (echo_gen). Once I worked out what was actually needed it wasn't too tricky to achieve. It would be helpful to have a few more practice scenarios along the way, not necessarily for assessment but useful for practice and cement learning.
El curso es excelente para su propÃ³sito, una introducciÃ³n. Sin embargo, serÃ­a excelente que hicieran una serie de cursos donde especialistas en distintas materias muestren las utilidades especÃ­ficas de los diferentes toolboxes de Matlab. Por ejemplo, finanzas, econometrÃ­a, termodinÃ¡mica, ingenierÃ­a, etc.
It was very helpful to me in all the aspect regarding programming,coding,problem solving etc. I have developed new skills in computer programming  through this course.I suggest that all the engineer who are interested in computer as well as machine programming  learning should take this course.Thank you
I enjoyed a lot this course. When I started, I already know a few things about MATLAB, so the first and the second weeks was a little boring, but when other weeks become, It started to be more challenging I learn many new things. Thanks, Coursera, Vanderbilt University, and my University (UFSM-Brazil).
Superb course for beginners to programming. The professors were truly awesome, and were really funny but at the same time had a clear cut idea of the concept and were exceptional in explaining them. The assignment questions towards the end were really challenging and were truly not meant for beginners.
This course on Matlab is very interesting and lots of learning, assignments are good and challenging. Brandon Sir and his discussion forum is very helpful to solve assignments. This has created a good hands on experience of Matlab programming, and will help me in learning more Matlab further. Thank You
Very helpful to learn principles of MATLAB. Some prior programming experience is best for this class, as it is not as comprehensive and basic as other programming fundamentals courses. However, great instructor videos with built in assignments accurately test and apply material learned in the course.
Perfect! It is a very nice course, I really enjoyed it a lot. I got to learn many new things, obviously MATLAB but also new programming-style related things even though I know C, C++, and Python already. The assignments were the best part, the questions very awesome, they helped me a lot in learning.
esta muy bien estructurado el curso , pero hay problemas que tienen su complejidad que en el curso no te explican, uno tiene que investigar por internet algunas cosas y esta bien eso, pero debe decir al principio que uno tiene que investigar solo tambiÃ©n para estar precavido a lo que salga en el quiz
Great Teaching.Systematically builds concepts from the begining. Micheal Fitzpatrick rocks!Mentors are very helpful and you are certain to get a reply within a day of posting your question on the forums page.Thanks a lot to Vanderbilt University and coursera for letting me be a part of this program:)
It was really fun to learn with these teachers. They are really amazing,no doubt about that.I really enjoyed the full course with them.Hope that, I will attend their class one day physically. Lots of love & respect for them.Iftekhar Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology Dhaka ,Bangladesh
ItÂ´s a very complete course, the teacher is a progammer expert! and he explains every concetp with clarity and his examples are helpfull to resolve the tests. (also his jokes are great).  If you have any doubt the course staff advises you. I hope there will be  the next part of the course!Thank you!
The course was truly helpful and intensive. I have learned so many things not only in Matlab software but also in computer programing basics. I have struggled at some points since I am a beginner in Matlab, but eventually, I passed those problems. Thanks to the amazing lecturer Dr.Mike Fitzpatrick.
I would specially like to thanks Professor and all those staff member who are associated with these course for helping me out during the course. Staff instructor as well as support staff make understand tough concepts in easy language as well as reply to the questions in a very short span of time.
very good experience...Professor Mike makes classes interesting. Discussion forums also help you to solve some difficult problems. This is the basic MATLAB course but it contains some challenging problems as well. I enjoyed every assignment and lecture. I am missing the professor's humor already.
Great course!The assignments are challenging and interesting. The topics are very well explained and take a logical sequence. The power of MATLAB is well presented in this classes.I'm sure that my programming skills got to a higher level and I've been recommending to all my friends and colleages.
creo que es un curso que es dictado por personas con amplia experiencia en el campo de la programaciÃ³n en MATLAB, ademÃ¡s saben como hacer entender los temas, es un curso introductorio, sin embargo hay "trucos" en los cuales solo se adquieren por experiencia o leyendo un libro y eso demorarÃ­a mÃ¡s.
I am a civil engineer. Yet I enjoy programming. I have enjoyed a lot and learned well with such an amazing instructors. I believe they are the best instructors for MATLAB. Learning this course has become a memory for me. Its an amazing experience. I loved solving homework problems in this course.
Really amazing course. The content was very well explained and the assignments really test your understanding. As long as you do everything here faithfully, you don't have to worry about anything else. I just wish there was part 2 of this course or at least some more self practicing assignments.
This course has taught me not only the language of MATLAB, but also the important principles in programming that I believe can be applied to other programming language. The course presents thoroughly and in a proper pace. The assignments as well as the grading system are also very comprehensive.
For me this course act like "POTTERS" that "MOLD" me to be a good MatLab Programmer. This course helps a lot in my academics and ongoing research project. MatLab is a language with great excitement and too simple. Thank you to all people behind this, especially to the professors in this course.
The course give you some matlab coding skills that could be helpful for academic research. If you are an engineer probably you are familiar with MATLAB but this course gives you specific skills which are mostly important for your purpose of using it. Thank to the instructors for great course.
This is a excellent course.the teacher is osam,he is easy to explained all weeks video and easy to understand by example,this is a very interesting course and all video have  been make by simple language and i will suggest all student must do this courseThank you sir for available this course
Incredible Experience! This course seemed out to be a journey with challenges in form of assignments. They test your capability to think out of the box. In addition to that, discussion forums are the best part of this course. Help provided by mentors and staff at each moment is an upper-hand.
This is a fairly straightforward course. The instructor Dr. Fitzpatrick is excellent and prepares you to do well on the assignments, quizzes, tests and programming assignments. The support via the Discussion Forum is also great. All in all very good. Some math background is certainly a plus.
This course on  MATLAB by Vanderbilt university is amazing. It offers various applications of the functions that they teach along with very knowledgeable and helpful instructors. I like the little fun that the professor keeps having during the lectures, it does make it much more interesting.
This was really a great memory conducting this course.If you are looking for a course where you wanna learn programming with fun by matlab,this course is for you.I can't express my greetings to the teaching staff.I just wanna say,thank you so much for making a helpful and interesting course
Very easy to understand, problems kept it engaging and were at exactly the right level; often quite difficult to solve but really satisfying when you did. They also meant you had to look back and remember what you'd learned in earlier parts of the course. I also really liked the instructor.
This course has been very helpful. Thanks to all our mentors and instructors, I have gained confidence. Now I believe that I can understand as well as solve problems in MATLAB. This course is very good for the beginners. I recommend it to whoever wants to learn about programming in MATLAB.
Absolutely brilliant course. highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn programming and coding.  Such amazing teachers to learn from. Thank you Michael Fitzpatrich, Akos Ledeczi, Vanderbilt University for this opportunity and Coursera for giving u such a wonderful platform to learn.
Thank you very much for your expertise. It is a very rewarding experience taking this class. I learned fundamental concepts in programming. When I started this journey, I had no knowledge on computer programming.  It is a good foundation for me to move on to other programming languages.
Easy-to-follow videos with thorough explanations of the fundamental. It consists of encouraging assignments (bearable if you watch all videos preceeding it) to check up your skill along the way. Very recommended for anyone (yes, ANYONE) who wants to try a programming language somewhere.
It's a very good course for matlab beginners . Course content is very good and assignments are of very good level. Instructor Mike is very good. His voice is clear and sharp in course. At last it is a very good course and I would recommend anybody to take this one for matlab beginners.
The best Course on programming ever!! Not only does it help you get accustomed to MATLAB it also helps to bring a strong foundation in programming. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and would definitely recommend it to all young engineering students !! Thank you for this wonderful course
Really helpful and suitable for beginners. Even though I had some programming experience in the past, professor Mike Fitzpatrick makes programming look easy. Would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning MATLAB, of course, but also to those interested in problem solving.
Top Course. The instructor teaches you in the best possible way. You do not need any prior knowledge about MATLAB. Absolutely wonderful course to lean. The assignments in the end become very difficult. One can dilute the difficulty to some extent. Nevertheless this one is a must-take!!
Great course for an introductory level. However, you should have skills in physics and mathematics in order to solve some of the homework. The lecturer speaks clear and try to make  enjoyable a subject that lacks of fun at all (programming), sometimes achieving it. Recommended course!
Well prepared and tailored for beginners in programming with MATLAB. The assignments helps with understanding the course even better. After taking this course, I discovered that I suddenly love MATLAB and all my fears for coding have vanished. Kudos to the facilitators of this course.
Best course I have done in Coursera so far! It is rewarding to learn new concepts of programming throughout the course, and MATLAB is a must to learn for engineers. A comprehensive course that gets you thinking 24/7 about several problems that can be solved efficiently by using MATLAB
A really good course especially for the beginners, who are planning to start programming with MATLAB. Detailed explanations and well-designed programming assignments covering the basics of MATLAB and providing room for logic development, which is the base for any kind of programming.
The course "Introduction to Programming with MATLAB" helped me in improving my skills and knowledge of the basics of coding and provided an exposure to the world of programming. During this course I learnt various important things which will surely help me in the professional world.
This course was a fun and excellent introduction to fundamental concepts of computer programming. For people who have no idea whatsoever about programming, this is the place to start. Even if you are a novice programmer, take this course to become more familiar with MATLAB language.
Excellent course to start programming with MATLAB.  It was a very involving course! Everything is taught by doing it practically, and the professor has done an excellent job. Assignments are really good and make you adept in what you learn the whole week. I enjoyed every bit of it!
The course is really informative and amazing. One can learn so much from this course. Though after a point of time, course will gather up a pace therefore one needs to explore many things by themselves too. But in the end, you'll love the content and the professor, not to mention.
Great course and a good one for anyone with little or no background in MATLAB. I started as a beginner with no background in MATLAB and with the help of the lecture videos I was able to do all the assignments (got 100% in all except 90% for the objectives) and complete the course.
An extraordinary opportunity to learn, to have discipline and dedication, and to enter the great world of programming, especially with MatLab which is a wonderful and fundamental tool for many professionals, thank you very much for the teaching given, I will be grateful for life.
This course really helped me learn MATLAB such a challenging programming tool from the very beginning, and tried to use it to solve more problems in my daily work and study. Thanks to the instructor's patient and explicit courses, I started to interested in practical programming.
One of the best courses present on Coursera. After completing the course I was able to do programming in MATLAB very easily. The course is very well structured and is very good for beginners. The instructors are amazing whether it be the video lectures or the discussion forums.
An unorthodox introduction into programming and an excellent introduction into MatLab! The tasks are interesting and some are a challenge even for an experienced programmer (at least for those whose everyday job does  not require knowledge about triangular waves or cyclotrons).
Really good course. If you complete all the problems by yourself and really push to get 100% in all assignments you will surely gain the skills to program in matlab. I started the course with little to no programming experience with matlab and this course really did it for me.
It was a remarkable experience with a roller coaster of difficulties, disappointments, and successes after hours of thinking about that error one can easily miss. I can not fully express how professor Fitzpatrick is good at teaching. His character is quite unique and amazing.
Great course. Enjoyed it a lot. It's so interesting that I completed it in less than half of the time given. I recommend this course to all those who want to learn MATLAB. Great for beginners. Taught very well by the course instructor. Discussion forum also helped very much.
Had a really fun and informative course with the professor Mike Fitzpatrick. His puns in between kept the whole thing alive lol!!Everyone who wants to understand a bit of coding should take this course as anyone without computer science background like me can grasp it well.
Excellent introduction to be a programmer in MatLab, I would like to add a comment about the creation of more examples related to each exercises or test in order to increase the skills because each example help to know to test every command. Thank you for this opportunity!
I had a great learning experience of Matlab in such a nice understanding way. My takeaway from this course is the fundamentals of programming in Matlab. Thought I am good in C/C++, Java and python but having this course let me think programming statements in different way.
Thanks for the delivering this invaluable knowledge in the form of lectures,assignments and readings.It will definitely helpful to me in problem solving through Matlab tools in many application. Hope for support from your side in future to make our relations more fruitful.
For a non programmer like me, this course was far more challenging  then I thought. Week 1 to 5 are easier to do. Week 6,7,8,9 are very challenging. Professor Mike has done really well to make such complex coding look simpler.I will revise the concepts as per the occasion.
The course is very nice. It is packed up with video lectures and challenging problems.what I liked about the course is the problems a student really needs to listen the lectures with concentration to solve problems.this would help you to brush up your knowledge of Matlab.
Thank you for this great introduction to Matlab.  Lessons are clear and effective. It was a chance for me to revise basic programming by learning a new language.  I also had fun  solving some homework! I would appreciate it very much if you could add some advanced topics.
This course helps me to improve my MATLAB skill. The instructor teaches this course very well. Moreover, the contents are enriched too. Whoever looking forward to improvising his/her MATLAB skill or getting started with MATLAB, I will recommend him/her to do this course.
Muy buen curso. Se aprende bastante. Al comienzo pensÃ© que no aprenderÃ­a mucho, dado que iniciÃ³ relativamente fÃ¡cil, y eso que no tengo mucha experiencia programando. Sin embargo, con el pasar las semanas, se tornÃ³ en un desafÃ­o muy satisfactorio. Totalmente recomendado.
It started off relatively easy and became progressively harder and it was adequately challenging and quite interesting particularly the final assignment. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn a new language and see the applications of Matlab in everyday life.
The course is extremely good. Thank you Vanderbilt University for this awsome course. However, I found the assignments a bit more complicated compared to the course materials. There are no hints for the last week assignments. The final 3 assignments are extremely hard.
Excellent course I extremely enjoyed the course. Just a suggestion to the beginners do not give up it took me really long but I did it finally so you need to be consistent whatever you do.Thanks to the professor and the whole team for such a great effort.Regards,Naqash
It's very good for beginner like me. The instruction teaches the course step by step which make the course very clear to rookies. Thank you very much for ppl who have involved in making this course! Highly recommended to everyone who want to start learning programming!
I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning more about programming! Having taken a similar course in Java, I still felt challenged and learned new things during each lesson. The professors were very clear and responded to forum inquiries promptly.
Very nicely organised course and the tutor was very clear in training us, my sincere thanks to the university and tutor.  The online MATLAB tool was very cute.  I Thoroughly enjoyed the course.  Hope I had more time, so that I could have focused and spent more time.
I'm on the 7th week and thanks for all your effort. I'm very happy to take this course. And it's really encouraging to see such efforts for teaching people all around the world. The course is very interactive, instructive, clever and covers the most important parts.
This is an amazing course for beginners. At the end of week 9, the final exercise really spice up things because they are based on the collective use of all the learning which we have gained until now. Thanks to Coursera for introducing me to this wonderful course.
The course is very Interactive  and interesting. But some video lectures are too long , which is a bit boring .Divide them in small videos. Overall it is great course .Thanks a lot , J.Michael Fitzpatrick and Ãkos LÃ©deczi as well as coursera for such a great course
I learned so much from this course. For a non-programmer, the lessons are organized very neatly, and all the concepts are well-explained. The skills I learned from this course can definitely extend to other programming languages I would want to learn in the future.
Precise explanation of each and every topic. The many assignments are on real applications, helps you to develop an understanding of how to use programming for real-life applications. Good support from the team in the discussion forums to help us solve the problems
This course have given me a solid base for further excellence in this particular course. I was very impressed  with and thankful to our instructor. yet here is many thing to cover in the field of MATLAB but this has provided me a solid head start. Thank you.......
I took this course to learn the basics of MATLAB. My knowledge in other programming languages also helped me throughout the course. Also, the tutor Prof. Mike did a perfect job in teaching this course. Now, I'm in a position to code my own with MATLAB. Thank you.
This was the most enjoyable class I have taken possibly ever. It was impeccably designed, the instruction was brilliant and sometimes goofy. I feel like I learned the basis of a useful skill and am excited to go deeper into MATLAB in the coming months. Thank you!
This is a great course and people who want to learn MATLAB coding with no prior knowledge of coding can benefit a lot. Professor Mike explains everything from small details like accessing various sections of GUI to intermediate level coding with immense patience.
Very accessible and the labs are really interesting to begin to practice.The content (video, presentation...), platform and tools are really awesome thanks to give all this available for everyone.Thank you for your work to provide us with this really good course.
An Excellent Course to Start and Learn Programming and/or MATLAB.Especially loved the Sense of Humour of the Professor who presented difficult concepts with Simplicity.Also, very Responsive Discussion Forums to answer any query which somehow escaped the Lectures.
Thanks a lot! Course content of this course is extremely good. I am hearty thankful to Prof. Mike Fitzpatrick and Prof.  Akos Ledeczi for their brilliant teaching.  I am looking forward for the advanced version of this course such as MATLAB for Numerical Methods.
This course is fantastic for getting a basic understanding of the fundamentals of MATLAB. The professor is well-spoken and easy to follow. The assignments are challenging yet doable. I recommend this to anyone who is wanting to learn the basics of this software.
I WOUID LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO ALL PROFESSORS AND ALL  MEMBERS WHO PREPARED THIS COURSE;SOMETIME STUDENTS MAY REQUIRE BOK WHICH IS REFEREED  FOR THIS COURSE BUT IT IS NOT FREESO I REQUEST IF IT WOULD BECOME POSSIBLE, PROVIDE IT FREELY ATLEAST FOR THIS COURSE ONLY
The Course is really good and if you are a beginner I highly recommend this course because the instructor goes through every small aspect and goes through each and every case and scenario. The instructor is amazing and I really enjoyed while gaining a new skill.
I'd say, this course was a tough one, but if you pour your heart and soul into this course and of course MATLAB, it would definitely prove to be an excellent experience and will add patience and resolve to your personality, as well as some weight to your resume.
I found this course very well made. Before attending this course I was able only to program in C and I always found Matlab a powerful but also vast program language, this course allowed me to understand all that details that I would hane not understood by myself
The course structure was very well designed so that a person with bare knowledge of Matlab (like me) could understand the programming fundamentals. I would like to express my gratitude to the instructor Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick for wonderful flow of lecture series.
It was an amazing experience learning MATLAB undir the guidance of Mr.Mike Fitzpatrick.He helped me a lot,the way he taught,hie examples,explanations was just amazing.I would like to recommend this course to every coding enthusiast whoever wants to learn coding
This course has done exactly what it advertised. Anyone with or without a programming background can learn MATLAB easily. The video lectures and course material are very very helpful. All the assignments are designed o enhance your learning. Excellent course!!!
An excellent and well-structured course that covers the basics elegantly; the lead instructor is very thorough and approaches each topic with great enthusiasm. The assignments truly put your knowledge to test and are engaging. All-in-all a well-rounded course.
I really thank myself because I did this course,it's surely one of the very best courses coursera has to offer.And what makes this course more interesting is those detailed explanation of everything by Professor Mike to go with a good set of practice problems
One of the best course i have learned. The teaching method which the sir adopts is very interesting .Learning the course made the process easy and interesting.The programs so practical that makes fun to learn.Sirs has done the best job in making the wonderful
Â¡Excelente Curso!Contempla todo lo bÃ¡sico y esencial para comenzar a programar y manejar distintos tipos de archivos, datos numÃ©ricos, matrices y hasta algunos tipos de archivos como imÃ¡genes y audio. AsÃ­ como el manejo de archivos de texto y microsoft Excel.
At the starting of the course I was deciding like should I take this course or not. The way the professor starts teaching got me addicted. A wonderful course and guided beautifully by the professor through the basics. Thank you sir for this wonderful course.
Excellent course! It gives you a good start to programming on MATLAB. I'd recommend this course for anyone with little or no previous experience at all. Prof. Fitzpatrick teaches right from the basics and in a pace that's easy to keep up with. Overall 5/5!!!
This course helped me understanding the very basics of matlab programing. i have learned debugging, working with function, and implementation of logic. Achieved a good habit like writing comments on program. And special thanks to professor Mike Fitzpatrick.
It is always a pleasure to learn from Professors who are so passionate about what they do, which is one of the reasons that made this course so enjoyable to go through. Professor Mike will definitely keep your attention rapt with his lucid and fun videos.
A great course for beginner/intermediate level with an amazing presenter. I wish I had professors like him at my university. A great course to learn the programming language. I can get back to this course whenever I need help with any type of programming.
This intro to matlab course on coursera is well designed for a beginner programmer and the concepts are well taught. I like the way of starting slow with basics and speeding up on comprehensive topics. overall i m satisfied ipon competion of this course.
Mike Fitzpatrick is an amazing instructor, kinda feels like Matter from Cars movie when he speaks has incredible knowledge and makes the course as much interesting as possible. I don't think I have done any other online course that felt this interesting.
The course was fantastic. I am humbled & grateful to the Vanderbilt University &  especially to Mike Fitz sir for delivering amazing knowledge on each topic comprehensively. I extend my best wishes to him & the team for their future. Thanks to one & all.
First of all lot of thanks to "coursera" for providing us such an amazing courses.couse instructor "Dr. Mike Fitzpatrick" explained and taught us very well.i am beginner to programming but now i feel very well and blessed.thanks very much to all of you!
I just loved every bit of this course. It is so very helpful to learn the basics of Matlab. I would love to join any intermediate or advanced Matlab courses under professor Mike Fitzpatrick. Urging for a basic Simulink and Stateflow course by Coursera.
The final course problems were challenging but not beyond what the course material provided. I loved the videos; the instructor was funny, and made me want to keep adding notes to my future codes(regardless of platform) for those who know to read them.
An excellently balanced and better composed course. Thanks to professor Mike FitzPatrick and coursera team for all the learning I had from here. I would strongly request professor Mike and the coursera team to offer a more advanced level Matlab course.
I believe that this is one of the best ways to get introduced. With the completion of this course, you should be able to gain reasonable programming skills which can be further brushed up by practising. I wish to thank the professor for his tutorials.
The method of teaching which the teacher followed was very helpful. The course covered many concepts which were new to me though I was using MATLAB previously. The assignments were designed very thoughtfully. Overall happy with the course. Thank you!!
I was using MatLab before this course reading the documentation. This course instead, help me realize what  I was doing wrong and become a mor effective programmer. It worthed the time I spent dealing with course's assessments regadless of difficulty.
Wow. I loved everything about this course. Excellent course content, excellent instructor and very very helpful discussion form. It contains so many assignments which are very tricky, but believe me, once you solve them, you will be proud of yourself.
Really clear instruction with assignments that are appropriately challenging. The staff are active in the discussion forums and the text is also very helpful. Really and excellent introduction to MATLAB and programming (I have no previous experience).
Curso Genial, super explicado y permitio ordenar con lo poco que sabia del Matlab, aprender gradualmente y como digo ordenarme. Me siento feliz con los coneptos aprendidos. no me cansare de decirlo es un curso geniaaaaal. Lo recomendare a mis Alumnos
The course is great and the content are very useful although the last assignment is a bit difficult becuase you need a bit accoustic skills to do that one and it take me a whole day to complete it . But put that aside it is really a wonderful course.
Vanderbilt University's Programming with Matlab offers very well structured and well delivered lectures. Course level, content and practice homework/exams have helped me build a solid foundation for my growing programming skills. Highly recommended!!
Introductory course on MATLAB.  Very well delivered, definitely recommended.  Enjoyed every little bit from beginning to end.  Recommended to everybody who heard about the MATLAB but he is afraid that it might be to difficult to learn how to use it.
It's my first programming experience and I must say it was awesome. Dr. Fitzpatrick is one of the best instructors I've ever seen. He taught the entire course a very decent way. The forum was also very helpful and teaching staffs are responsive too.
This was an absolutely amazing course which teaches the fundamentals well enough for us to build on and learn more. The method of teaching of the professor was very engaging. Thank you for putting up this course. Worth the money for the certificate.
The best course I've taken on Coursera. Funny instructor and very well taught course. Lectures are concise and homework problems can become challenging but rewarding. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in learning programming with MATLAB.
I really enjoy the course. It helped me to know and understand how to use MATLAB in a basic way. This course will strength your MATLAB skill with a lot of assignments. The longer you go, the harder exercises but I believe that's a good way to learn.
This is an awesome course provided by  VANDERBILT UNIIVERSITY. You people are enhancing our knowledge in such a typical situation of pandemic. I am personally really appreciating your all efforts. Thanks to coursera as well as Vanderbilt university
The teacher is very clear in his explanations and has a good sense of humor . Although I had computer programming lessons, it was 35 years ago, so this was a chance for me to review the logic of computer programming. Thank you very much professor.
This course very good for learning programming. Good lectures and exercises. Assignment runs with each video very well. It was easy to go back and listen to the lectures. The discussion forum is helpful. Thanks for putting this course on Coursera.
I will definitely recommend this course for a beginner, who has no previous knowledge about MATLAB.The instructor Mike Fitzpatrick is awesome, I admired him. Gained a good knowledge from this course. thanks to Coursera and vanderbilt university...
A comprehensive overview of the basic principles of Matlab as a programming language. Instruction is clear, but not overbearing and the tasks engaging and frustrating ( in the best possible way, the way all engineering problems are frustrating ).
A brilliantly structured and executed course. Prof. Fitzpatrick's classes are so much fun! I'm particularly grateful that this course was designed for beginner coders, and makes it seem like anyone can learn programming without too much effort.
Had a great amount of fun while programming in Matlab.  I have a little bit knowledge about C and C++ and  I can tell that that Matlab is way simple and easy to program with than the other two. Thanks for providing such a wonderful course.  :))
Wonderful course it taught me a lot to handle through matlab an saying about the last three problemsit really helped me a lot to discover solutions to real world problems through matlab thanks to fitzpatrick sir for such a wonderful explanation
An Excellent course. I love the way it was taught. I loled at some parts and slept through some but it was worth an experience. It really pushes you to become better. Last exercise were challenging but everything is difficult before it is easy.
it's really a great course taught by such a great teacher. i learned basic programming skills and have solved some problems with matlab. i feel so proud of myself and i'm finally not scared of programming anymore. this course really changed me.

The awesome class conducted by sir Fitzpatrick from Vanderbilt university gives us great knowledge and enhancement to our skills may we hope that Coursera continuously gives us such great advancements in knowledge thankyou verymuch
This is a wonderful course and very informative for students who want to learn Matlab but has little or no coding experience. The lectures give very specific explanation of how to code with Matlab and what details we should notice.
Loved it! Gained many more insightful views about the Matlab, since I was a ginner at the start of the topic...now I can fully guarantee I can understand most of the codes which I may come across...Thank you all for the Guidance!!
The module is well designed! The lecturer makes the material interesting with a sense of humour. All doubts and queries in the discussion forums are answered efficiently and comprehensively. Overall, it is an excellent experience!
A very helpful course (especially for beginners). Starts slowly but gradually it enhances the content and level of problems. Topics covered are very important but some more topics can be touched upon. Otherwise a wonderful course
This Course gives lot of ideas to write matlab program in my own ways.Course Instructor is explained lot of concepts in clear manner .Its really useful to research Scholars.My heartfelt thanks and wishes to the course instructor.
Perfect for getting into programming for the first time, or getting into MATLAB for the first time with prior programming experience. Questions are challenging enough for the latter case, but simple to understand for the former.
The course was really helpful for as an Engineering student pursuing graduate course in Electronics as MATLAB is the standard in various colleges in India. It allowed me to learn and tackle various useful problem with elegance.
Es un excelente curso, especialmente para personas que nunca antes habÃ­an tenido experiencia alguna con el programa. Las explicaciones y los ejemplos son muy claros y el hecho de que uno pueda ir a su ritmo es una gran ventaja.
Got an opportunity to learn programming even under busy schedules. Thanks to Coursera and its team members for teaching the basics of matlab programming. I would really recommend all to join coursera to keep themselves updated.
The designated course offered by Vanderbilt University, Introduction to Programming with MATLAB is a highly interactive and indulging course that truly consolidates one's notions and concepts on the MATLAB programming language.
It's an excellent course for anyone who's starting with programming.  It gives you an excellent background for basic programming skills and finally at the end of the course you will have a very good command over MATLAB as well.
It is an excellent course, comprising of knowledge driven lectures with a little bit of healthy humor by the instructor. It starts easy and gradually increases its difficulty level hence not  hampering once's rate of progress.
Very well organized with great introduction to Matlab though i already had an experience in using Matlab , this course explained a lot of new things.Very thanks to the Instructor. I played the video at 1.5x and 1.25x sometime.
Really interactive way of teaching they had. I would prefer this course to all of them who not only  want to learn Matlab but also to them who love to build logical thinking.Learning adventure was great and will be continued..
Excellent course! I really liked the teacher and the exercises. I will suggest it to every student that needs to learn programming and MatLabOne suggestion: can you put more "practical examples" based on "real-world problems"?
Everything is excellent about this course: videos are very well structured and entertaining. Exercises are sometimes challenging but there is great support and no question has not a quick reply. I highly recommend this course.
This course is really the best I could find on the Internet for anyone that wants to learn MATLAB. The material is good, and the assignments are really challenging and will absolutely help understand the concepts being taught.
Profeese Michael Fitzpatrick i have loved him through the course  he is super frindly , funnyand very  clever at what he does i googled him and found that that guy is a genious .thank you professor Fitzpatrick love from Egypt
I had to do a good amount of starting and stopping which I believe slowed me down and hindered my absorption of the information but this was a fantastic intro into CS/programming for me. I highly recommend taking this course.
the course was awesome, the assignment kept me excited and curious. those were very helpful to remember what have I learned and how can I implement in the real world problem too. Thank you very much for this wonderful course.
It was one of the best courses on MATLAB. The journey was very informative. During the course, i applied all my learned skills on other subjects, such as Mechanical Vibration, Mechanics etc. I hope to learn more from Coursera
The course is intensive and good to work around. Look forward for a free course on using toolboxes of Matlab in Simulink. Major interest is with automotive, image processing, video processing, using AI and antenna simulation.
This is the best platform to learn computer programming in Matlab. The best thing about this course is that they give us homework and provide us grader that check the each problem and tell whether the solution is true or not.
It was an extraordinary experience learning this programming in MATLAB and the lectures made me to get fascinated about the course and indulged me to work more on it. I am happy for having completed this course successfully!
It was an amazing course, I have learned a lot of principles in a two ways , first from the lecture , second from the assignments :)Thanks for Coursera group and for all student that they shared the question on this course .
I really enjoyed listening and learning from the Professor because he goes very slow, explaining all the details that one might miss out. The module is also very appropriately paced even for beginners to programming like me.
This course is really helpful to me, it is neither tough nor easy to do. The quality of study as well as the questions are so fine. Discussion forums really helps to understand or realize the situation of problem.Thank you..
I have limited knowledge about coding but I am a good learner and I am good at linear algebra and other advanced mathematics. I enjoy listening the instructors' teaching. Gradually, I believe I will get familiar with Matlab.
Muy completo, y trae muchos problemas para que puedas aprender de manera efectiva MATLAB. Existen unos pocos cambios en MATLAB para la parte de Excel pero con todo lo demÃ¡s me fue de mucha utilidad para iniciar a programar.

The course contents were amazing, especially Assignments and Final Course Projects.The Instructor taught amazingly. wish to learn more courses from him. somehow my memories are tied to the end theme music of each lesson.
This is best course to learn MATLAB. Tutor does his job great .Easy to understand the lectures, the assignments made this course tricky and more intresting, which enables to implement the knowledge learnt in the lessons.
Before starting this course, I had never used Matlab before and my programming skills were next to non-existent. I have finished this course solving exercices I never thought I could.It is well worth the time investment.
Great course, learned a lot about programming, the lectures are pretty good, you learn a lot from them and then you can put your skills to practice with the assigments, the later ones are challenging but very rewarding.
Very informative. The tone of the professor is like narration of some hollywood movie. This is my favourite course next to linear algebra by Gilbert Strang. Thank you everyone who made this useful information available.
The course was very eye-opening on how easy it is to use MATLAB. The assignments were challenging and made me think rationally. I also learnt to break down each problem into smaller sections to make it easier to solve.
It is a well-developed course and the instructor put too much effort to teach us all the basics of the MATLAB with having fun.  I definitely recommend this course to my friends for proper learning. Thank you very much!
This class was terrific! The instructor added a few bits of humor throughout, while balancing an online course that was well-paced, clear and informative. I would absolutely recommend to others looking to learn MATLAB.
What a beautiful course. The assignment problems are challenging but are at a manageable level. The teacher is also amazing at his job, involving humor from time to time to lighten the mood. Kudos to everyone involved.
Very nice introduction with a nice overview of all the functionality of MATLAB. The exercises are also helpful in understanding MATLAB better and have a learning curve which gets steeper as you advance in the lectures.
Amazing!!. I really recommend take this course and buy the book (it's very cheap with useful content). The course give to you the basic to apply MATLAB in your study field!. The instructor is clear with sense of humor.
This is the very first course I have tried at coursera and it has been a great experience. The course is really well designed to make first time learners feel comfortable with their first steps in computer programming.
I was scared of programming before starting this program. This program was not easy for me, but, as I completed it, I'm now confident that I can take up my programming skill further. Thanks to Instructors and Coursera.
Very good course.I have learnt many new things related to programming.Also the instructor is doing his job in very friendly manner.This course is starting with simple content and ending with complex programming facts.
This is one of the best courses I've ever seen. Since I really new to programming and I need to learn the basics of programming with MATLAB, this course helped me to learn and practice in the way I needed.Many thanks
A perfect set of study pack for acknowledging the MATLAB programming course. A real life project based assignment and also contain basics understandings problems. A faculty concern very good on the every topic of it.
The best course I have ever taken so far. Contents were really interesting and nicely arranged.  Though the last 3 home assignments brought in a lot of struggle but it was worth it. Thanks for the wonderful course!!!
Very well designed course! The instructors from Vanderbilt have done an excellent job. I sincerely enjoyed every bit of it. Many thanks to Prof Fitzpatrick, Prof Ledeczi, and the moderators Prof Paul, Matt and Bjorn.

It's an excellent course for people with and without prior coding experience.Deals with all basics necessary to kick start an interest and insight to MATLAB.Advanced courses of the same would be greatly appreciated.
The Instructor was clear and made the topic even clear..He tried his level best such that the listener wont feel any topic as boring.It would be better if he explained more on working with images(image processing).
I was new to programming but now i can say that i am good at programming in matlab.topics are clearly explained.i recommend guys to do this course.ofcoure assiginments gets challenging when we go on to later weeks.
I have no knowledge in computer science. I started with Python and following was MATLAB. Surprisingly the instructor made it look like it is so easy to learn MATLAB and the assignments helped too .Thanks a lot !!!
Excellent course. Professor Fitzpatrick is a wonderful teacher. I had previous experience with Matlab and took this course to refresh my memory, It was a mixture of fun and challenge. I really enjoyed this course
A great (re)introduction to MATLAB! Would be helpful if the assignments could give you more helpful feedback in some of the later assignments, but google searching errors can be helpful. Just takes a lot longer.
Taught is very simple manner so that even person with non programming background can start coding with matlab. Prof. Mike was exceptional in teaching every concept. I will surely recommend to go for this course.
As a beginner this course is absolutely right choice to be picked up .  All the topics are explained in very easy manner . Really, Coursera is the great platform for students to explore many more amazing things.
Awesome for beginners . Improve your programming skills as well as analytic thinking towards problem. Solutions comparison is the best way to see how much still you can improve your code. I'll recommend it 100%.
I'm satisfied with this course. The instructor is quite clear and has a great sense of humor. Exercises are a little bit difficult, but for that reason, I feel really confident to face big programming problems.
Excellent course for MATLAB beginners. A comprehensive collection of content, with easy and fantastic explanation. With self-paced learning, this is one of the best, if not the best course on MATLAB guaranteed,
The instructor was great and easy to understand. I love both the lecture and how the instructor, Mr. Fitzpatrick, relate each end of the lesson to real life situations. It was a great and well-organized course.
I have never finished a course like this before, and I can't explain how fabulous the instructor was and the quality of the curriculum as a whole. I 'd suggest this to my colleagues and friends, too. Thank you.
being able to finish this class in less than a month was really amazing, I was not familiar with MATLAB coding but now I believe that I am capable of understanding MATLAB codes and writing some codes if needed.
excellent course , excellent teacher. Mark Fitzpatrick was very clear and capable to keep the attention af the students at high level all the time. The tests were interesting and well balanced with the lessons.

Very well structured course, it was a great learning experience, although some questions are really tough and at time tough to understand but going through the Matlab coursebook makes the work pretty easy
This is a perfect Matlab introductory course. I highly recommend taking it before taking any advanced Matlab courses. This course covers basic programming syntax, which will be very helpful in the future.
It was a valuable course .The assignment were tough so that we can think more on the solution.overall it was a complete package of knowledge.Thank you professors and the coursera team for all the support.
The best course for someone who hates programming!  For almost 5 years, I was running away of Matlab, finally made it with this course!Thank  you Professor Fitzpatrick, you made me change my bad habits :)
A very very informative course for those who need to brush up their skills or are looking to learn it from scratch. The basics are covered in detail video lectures and can be tested with the assignments.
Great course for the beginners who want start the codding with MATLAB.  It covers all basic concepts and at the end of course you definitely becomes programmer with amazing skills with applications also.
It was a great course that explained Matlab & it's features in a very simple way and helped me gaining confidence to write basic codes to process image and audio signals by visualizing them as a matrix.
The course seems simple in the started, and yet assignments were interesting. Later part of course was intensified and somehow overloaded and bit of irrelevant too. Like reading Figures, and echo etc...
Excellent course overall, and one of the best resources available for beginners. Do not expect a walk in the park however. This course expects maximum effort, which will ultimately help in the long run.
Whole content designed beautifully in keeping in mind that beginners to moderated. I happy by completing this course and I learn a lot. Thanks, Coursera team and resource person(Vanderbilt University).
This course is designed for the beginners who have no prior knowledge in the Matlab Programming.In last weeks assignments are a little bit difficult but go through the discussion forums and ask things.
