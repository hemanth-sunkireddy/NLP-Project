A bit difficult in terms or using very complicated words....
непонятно, на кого ориентирован курс. для профессионалов освежить знания (тогда почему не освещены все темы, разделы, кратко все группы заболеваний?), или для пациентов чтобы ознакомиться (тогда зачем подробно про гистологию, про этапы обследования, отсутствие рекомендаций и списка симптомов каждой рассмотренной патологии). некоторые картинки плохого качества, будто фотографии двадцатилетней давности. некоторые темы очень подробные, некоторые вообще не освещены.
The course was very informative. It was definitely geared more for people already in the dental field, rather than students who were hoping to just get a taste of it, but I still found it very useful. Quizzes and the final exam had some difficult questions, but you could retake them as many times as needed, which was very useful. There were a couple glitches: full-screen viewing always stopped about 30 seconds before each lecture ended and the "newly added lectures" had a few little glitches as well. Overall, the course was useful to learn about the dental field, I don't know if it was worth paying for the certificate, but it is worth taking the time to do the course.
Good introductory course for non-dentists. However, it could incorporate more modern technologies, such as 3D imaging, new orthodontic aligners and etc.
The content of this course is very useful and effective in our career. However, It can be updated with more clinical videos related to the dental specialties that illustrate the steps to be performed in each dental treatment. Finally, i'm very grateful to your great efforts and the scientific material you provided us.
This course is insightful into potential careers with dentistry and helpful in gaining an understanding of teeth and dental practices. As a Qualified Equine Dental Technician I can also recommend this course to any Veterinarians and para professionals wanting to further their knowledge in the world of Dentistry.
I learned very much from this course. However, I believe that the Final Exam should have a type of study guide to help students in learning have confidence. This course is good for those who are interested in having a dental career.
I am only 16, and yet I was able to complete this course with ease. Its great for if you want an insite into Dentistry. I would really recommed it, I thoroughly enjoyed the content.
Really helped me a lot in learning the basics of dental medicine. Thanks to coursera and learned experts of dental medicine to organize such courses.
Very informative course... i had gained much knowledge regarding oral health.....thanks to the teachers and practitioners of oral health .
one can also add everyday pharmacology related to dentistry. overall a very summarised introduction and helps revising basics.
It is quite helpful for everyone but for professionals it is superficial and I wanted it to be more explanatory with examples.
Avaliei em 4 estrelas, pois não era sempre que tinha legenda em português o que dificultou um pouco ao meu ver.
The last 2 chapters or weeks are very long, at some point it became boring and mentally exhausting.
Thank you for such great course ...it really enhanced my knowledge and interest towards dentistry
great effort, thanks very much i hope there will be advanced course for dental professionals
I wish they had more exciting information. It was basically a revision to everything I took.
It was not too hard and gave me a good reason to get up and do my work every day.
I liked the course ,but get rid of the introductory music ,too long and annoying
It was a wonderful experience learning this course. Thanks!
OKPresentation a little 'robotic'
I am glad to do this course.
Questions were too hard.
I am going to the Dentist School and I feel like this is a very beneficial course that introduced me perfectly to the dentistry sea. It's really awesome.Thank you Pennsylvania university!
The course is very informative and well organized. I am a dentist and got an opportunity to brush up my basics. Thank you to the faculty of UPenn. I will highly recommend this course to the dental students and dentists.
Hello, i'M currently a  4th year dental student from Malaysia, and this course is much relevant and able to  provide an overall aspect to the dentistry course . Highly recommend to 2nd year dental student before entering their clinical year/ Foundation student who are interested in dentistry ( might be hard for u guys tho ). Hoping for more specialized dental course , ( endo, prostho, ortho ) in near future from your university, please do remind me if there's advanced dental course .  Thank you and much appreciated.
This was worth my time! The lessons are in the form of videos, and I must say, they are quite organized and detailed. I loved it so much, that I'm now tackling their next course. The Oral Cavity: Portal to Health and Disease.
Great overview of issues encompassing the patient assessment and management in the general dental practice underpinned by theoretical basis of health and disease supported by the latest evidence .
This course was of great help. In a short time, it refreshed my 5 years Bachelors in Dental Surgery.
Absolutely loved the course. Since I'm thinking about becoming a dental assistant, I wanted to know a little more about dentistry as a whole, and English not being my first language didn't get in the way, as this course is easy to follow, the subtitles and transcripts are extremely helpful, and the material is explained in great detail by amazing professionals. Certainly left me even more passionate about this field, thank you so very much!
I enrolled in this course looking for an introduction to supplement my current dental shadowing experience, but there is so much more. I really love the organization of the material. This course is thorough, and the instructors are great! I really wish there was more of an interaction with the instructors, but overall this is an amazing course and I loved it. I recommend all PreDental students to take this course!
Introduction to Dental Medicine was a well-thought out course which thoroughly exposes a learner to the field of dentistry. It's an excellent course for a student, patient, or professional interested in the interplay of dental health with overall health. The professors are knowledgeable and the material is understandable yet challenges you to really listen and learn. I highly recommend this course!
Amazing! This is a very well structured introductory class that will give you an accurate idea about the field of oral medicine and dentistry; they even covered advanced stuff like medication related osteonecrosis of the jaws. The intraoral/extraoral examinations were very valuable, insightful and easy to understand, even for a person with no related background. Great Job and thank you so much!
Introduction to dentistry is a great course. As a dental student I`ve learnt many new infromation that will help me on my way of becoming a dentist. For people aren`t connected with medicine or dentistry this course won`t be a trouble as information given by great teachers is simple, intersting and for sure useful. Thank you!
The course was so easy to understand and I loved the videos. Thank you very much to everyone who worked to make this course happen. Very grateful to Dr. Uri Hangorsky, Dr. Thomas P. Sollecito, Dr. Eric Stoopler, Dr. Katherine France. This was the only way i was in touch with dentistry during months of quarantine.
This course has provided me with the general basic knowledge I need in order to start an education on Dental Medicine. I highly recommend it for all those who are pursuing any Dental Medicine studies and also everyone who is concerned about their dental health and want to know more about the subject.
An excellent course that provides you with an overview of and an insight into the various areas of dental medicine. For me as a medical translator it was not only a great learning experience, but also added value to my business. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in dentistry.
Excellent course for a beginner like myself! Sufficiently comprehensive, especially for someone like me who is taking this course for marketing purposes as I  work in the dental industry.  I highly recommend this as a foundation course for anyone wishing to get a good overview of the practice.
Thank you so much Penn Dental University for this wonderful opportunity. This course will be a great help in college, since I learned a lot in this 7-week long course. This could be my starter knowledge so that I'll just have to learn more in my college. Once again, thank you so much!
O melhor curso que já fiz em minha vida. Me senti como uma verdadeira aluna da UPenn, quero continuar a fazer cursos na universidade, e se possível, visitá-la pessoalmente um dia. UPenn superou todas as minhas expectativas através da plataforma Coursera, da qual continuarei fiel.

I absolutely loved this course! As someone who plans on going to dental school soon, this course was a great way to  get my feet wet on a lot of topics. I definitely learned so much about dentistry that I had no idea about!
I have learned a lot from this course like how to be a good dentist, knowing the details of ever field and anything new in dentistry, being aware of fields you can work in it after graduation and knowing more about teeth.
