indeed this course was very helpful for me, then the forum and classmates were given  a good support so this should engage me to continue study and increase my skills and qualifies. we should satisfy on the method and the lectures were giving to us on the screen with clear of slides and chunks.
Sorry, but the examples with Africa are too much... From one side are very depressive, from other perspective  - this is not relevant for me.It seems like a story from National Geographic, not a course.
I think, this is a bright journey and exceptional opportunity for me to explore in a career planning at  the new generation of century.
I finished this course and could not get certification at the end
give my results in email please I need it right now
It is not as advanced as it seems!
The English is quite basic and the explainer talk very very slow, which makes it exhausting and annoying to listen to. The knowledge gained from this course is good, but if you have pre-existing knowledge it will be just redundant. For me personally not a gain, but it might be for people with no experience in this area.
Great idea but unprofessional design and programming.Looks like nobody double-checked it before starts to offer it, especially for money.  Almost every Quiz and separate questions has programming bugs.Waiting for ver 2 ASAP.
English for Business and Entrepreneurship course is very comprehensive, very brief and very easy to understand for be gainers. All features of Entrepreneurship and language used for the Business and Entrepreneurship are well taken.
It only gives you a basic overview of start up's vocabulary. However, it is very simple for who has never experienced economics subjects.
Great Course. Assignments are the best part of the course.
Good test and great knowledge for business startup thanks
Good course in Professional
Basic but well done
The course is amazing . Recommend to all those having interest in the field of business and entrepreneurship. Although I have been a business studies student since last 4 years , I knew almost 90% of what was taught but no doubt I have learnt lot of new strategies, concepts , how to persuade investors and attract customers. During the Covid -19 pandemic, I’ve utilised this time learning new things. Thank you coursera
overall the course was very easy to understand and i must say i did learn a lot of new things here, had a lot of firsts too. thankyou for letting us have a free version. the only critisism i have is about the way the assignments are graded. there needs to be a way to make sure that the learners actually do these assignments properly.
One of the best course I have done in 2020 related to entrepreneurship and business along with the English language. Two authors are great and it is reflecting their experience and knowledge. I recommend this course for any person who wants to know and learn about entrepreneurship, business plan, finance and terms used in business.
This was my first course with Coursera and I really like the course, instructors and the syllabus covered. Incorporated Assignments were also good. It was a great help to think and plan about my start up business. After completing this course I am very clear how to process in it. Thanks a lot.
Overall in this Course lots of information is available On Business and Entrepreneurship.I learn lots and lots of information about Entrepreneurship like (product place price promotion).I really interested in Entrepreneurship that's why I'm taking in this course
Instructors is very warmly and clearly to give explanation, also this course is valuable for non native speaker to improve their English language skill. It is good course to follow it. Thank you for AE Institute, Coursera Team and lovely Instructors also UPENN.

Very interesting Course. Topics like Business Plan & Elevator were made simple and understandable.The appropriate English for Business and Entrepreneurship was taught. Many thanks to Faculty and the Coursera Team.
It's really good for especially newbies in business or those with intermediate English knowledge. You'll learn a lot from vocabulary to basic business planning. Good luck on your journey guys!
This course is really good. I came at it thinking I know English well and do not need to be taught like I'm a first grader. But I'm learning more about entrepreneurship. It is fantastic.
Good for starters and entrepreneurs whose mothertongue is not English. The tasks you have to achieve every week are doable and keep you productive. Explaining videos are the best. :)

communication skills that make students more attractive.Thank you

Possibly a bit too simple for an advanced English learner. However, first time ever to complete a business plan writing. Pride of myself!

Well structure in delivering the course of teaching and course works. I find it benefit me in the scope of content and steps guidance .
Great opportunity to learn about beginning a new business and how to prepare a business plan. It is a basic course, but it is helpful.

Excellent online cours.  But the sound of the cours less important,  I would like that you review this. Thanks for all.

English for Business and Entrepreneurship course is a good and interesting course, i had fun learning.i'll definitely recommend the course to my loved ones. Kudos to the brain behind the course.
I enjoyed participating in this course because it was easy to follow, the structure was logical, a lot of repetition, a lot of useful specific vocabulary that was extremely well explained. Fantastic teachers! Thank you very much and I wish you all the best for your future! I also liked that the schedule was flexible and a learner was given a chance to take a test again in case it was not successfully completed for the first time.
With this course, I can have more knowledge in doing business, starting from having ideas to having funds and operating the startup. Hope to learn more about business process through other course.
Really enjoy it, with interactive features and relevant knowledge to both English and Entrepreneurship. Just be passion and try to focus and learn, take notes and follow till the end. Good luck!
What an entrepreneur need from describing your idea, market research, writing a business plan to making a persuasive pitch, the key element to attract potential investors. I do recommend this course
A cornerstone course for anyone wanting to improve their English with focus on Business & Entrepreneurship. Takes you through setting up you Business and the English you might need. Good Course!
This course was very useful for me in terms of remebering the Busines and Entrepreneuship concepts. This course is designed in easy and simple way to get knowledge on specific vocabulary. Teachers speak not fast and it is great for those who just starts to learn English for work or passing language exams. Course also have very bright, clear images, definitions and moreover it includes grammar classes. I can definitely advise this course that is led by teachers from Penn Unniversity.
This course helped me to develop certain skills such as how to create a Business Plan, how to conduct a Market Research as well as enrich my English Vocabulary on Business and Entrepreneurship. I really liked the combination of interactive features and relevant knowledge especially the instructors' videos because they were pleasant and beneficial at the same time. I do recommend this course.
This is an outstanding course. The bad thing was someone copied my work and plagiarize it and uploaded it as their work. It was about the business plan about Keto Brownies. The culprit name was "Sara Imran Butt". Unfortunately I didn't know what action was taken against the person because Coursera never got back to me again on the issue.
I'm so lucky that I have found this course. 
This is such a great course that provided me with an opportunity to study what I want to learn for free and with the very good quality and quantity. 
It took me a month and a little bit but it is worth my time 
I really appreciated all the lesson that you have done for us, teacher. 
Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.
The way you teach is very easy to follow along with very memorable vocabulary and informative information.
After learn each lesson I develop myself a lot I gain more vocab and I can understand the business vocab which is very impressive. I can talk like I am a business owner or a start up business.
I can even  catch up the subject at my university more easily ^_^ 
I love this course  
THis is one of my favourite course.

THank you so much University of Pennsylvania.  for giving me a chance to study even though I don't have the money or I can't afford the price of the real course or studying aboard but I still can study here online at my home.   After finish this course I'm planning to write a letter to this course and I hope that the financial aid is still available for me since I can't afford the fee. 

all in all, I would recommend all my friends and give 5 stars to this course and the teachers :) 
I love this course and I'm much more confidence on the business part :D 
I'll be the business owner in the near future and at that time I owe this course ^_^ 
hope one day, I could have time to visit this university and both of you, my lovely teacher.

hope you have a great day and a healthy body ^_^

I have understood the whole business process right from conceiving an idea, Market Research, startups, Risk factors, Creating Business plans, and marketing through social media, Investment sourcing, through social media, Venture capitalists By presenting with necessary stuff like business plans, market research and business plan and financials.Not just the above business process, as well as i have improved the Business vocabulary.Even if you are an entrepreneur already, this course will help you understand more about the entrepreneurship.Thanks Coursera Team.Jeyakumar Subbiah
This course is very useful for me. I could learn not only English but 
also about entrepreneurship. I could learn how to write a business plan 
and have written brief business plan in the assignement. Beside I could 
learn Pitch- persuasive conversation to investors for our business plan. Teacher James Riedel and teacher Amy Nichols, the lectures of the course, are very good at teaching. They speak very clear English and so most of the learner can understand well. I suggest everyone to enroll this course and do assignment regularly. You will gain much knowledge and have fun.
i recommend that course for every one who is looking for next step in business and English business it is very handy and simple and the most is the instructor they are amazing
This Course is perfect for any kind of person who wants to start a business or wants to be an entrepreneur but lacking sort of Information and Ideas of how and where to start the business . From this lesson you'll get to learn how to connect with investors and how to use your innovative ideas. I could write a lot here but It will be better if you just enroll this course and go along with it. It is so much fun to learn here. Even if you enrolled here for free you'll be a successful person in life if you followed these chapters later in your life. Thank you Cousera,  Thank you "English for business and Entrepreneurship" and Thank You - UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.
Concepts were explained in a easy method and helped me a lot. Also gave a lot of skills and methods of communication. Helped conducting market research and creating a business plan. Thank you !!!
honestly, when i decided to follow this class i didn't know that the teaching would be as perfect as i found it. classes are well organized and the knowledge are grasped easily without even any revision. furthermore the external stool is just wonderful and a had fun all along . i will for sure recommend this class to my family friends and social medias to let them get the same opportunity me. thanks to coursera and thanks to the university of Pennsylvania and its tutors. i hope to purchase a certificate soon.
What a fantastic course! It covered everything an entrepreneur needs to know in 5 weeks. I learnt the meaning of Venture Captalist, Equity owner, angel investor and so many other terms. Making the business plan was the topmost skill i acquired as that really gives one a clear picture of where one stands now and after 3 years.The videos were very clear and articulated the points very well. I will give this a 10 / 10.
Awesome and eye-opening course! It especially taught me more about entrepreneurship, challenged me to come up with viable business ideas, conduct market research and use the data to make decisions, and write a winning business plan.I'll strongly recommend it to my network!
The course gave me a wonderful opportunity to know and understand the basics of business. The language used is simple, clear, and inspiring.  Though,  I had no idea of starting a business initially, after attending the classes, I am enthused to start one on my own and also want my children to study the business concepts in their early life...so they can become best entrepreneurs in the future.  I recommended my children to pursue these courses. I am profoundly thankful to the university and organizers of the course and wish them all the best.  I am also thankful to Sri Pradeep Kumar, who introduced this course and website  to me  and  in helping  me in proper utilization of time during the lockdown due to COVID-19
I think this course delivers what is expected from it. It has given me a true and precise introduction to Business and entrepreneurship, while refreshing some well-known concepts about economics and finance. I'm inmensely grateful towards Coursera because this has given me the opportunity to continue learning and perfectioning my English and has also given me hope, as to dream on having my own business in the future. I think this platform is very easy to use, very explicative and I was able to understand the teachers' every single word, in spite of English being my second language. I appreciate all the effort put into this course and the whole Distance Learning program.
English for Business and Entrepreneurship is best for English learners in this field, as well as who wants to get basic knowledge about Business and Entrepreneurship.The course consists  a lot useful and informative articles and due to covered dozens of vocabulary.To be honest, I didn't expect so could be engaging through the all weeks.In brief, I would strongly recommend you Coursera.Thank you, lovely teachers and The University of Pennsylvania ❤️❤️❤️
For all the businessman is focusing management is very Important this series of courses that teaches Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship students learn to read market signals , but less noticeable , to be ahead of trends and make decisions appropriate , which is already one of the main characteristics of the have Entrepreneur is to know the information and use it for their own companies benefit and lead to success .
Coursers opened my eyes and my mind, i was fried to start my dream being as a Entrepreneur, but diving deeper in this course made me feel confidant about going ahead and get what i'm dreaming for.
I learned a lot about entrepreneurship. It was easy to understand because they designed a great course for people who know basic English. This course is a good opportunity to improve English skills. I want to say thanks to everyone who are involve in the design, organization, plan, and more to teachers that shared their knowledge with us. Thanks to my classmates for review my assignments. Good course to invest your money.
Me ha gustado mucho este curso me parece muy directo y objetivo hacia lo que uno debe aprender sin ningún adorno que distraiga la atención.Lo único que no me ha gustado es la parte de foros ya que en mi caso no dispongo de mucho tiempo para ponerme a leer y los demás participantes escriben mucho con lo cual me pierdo entre tanta información, podría haber un software que maneje mejor este tema de las discusiones en foro.
This course was very useful for me as i could learn some new skills like writing a Business plan, Principles of Entrepreneurship, Effective Use of English language for Business and Entrepreneurship, correct use of English grammar in Business Communications, learnt to conduct effective market research survey using questionnaires, learnt to carry out analysis, and write effective Business and Market reports.
This course is very helpful for both who wants to study English and for whom to study the basic of business especially in Entrepreneurship. As an experienced worker in the field, the level of English and the contents of business/Entrepreneurship were not too difficult but were really essential and helpful to review. I now am more confident to use the knowledges at work and feel eas to explain to others.
This is a great course and best opportunity for anyone who wish to start business. A knowledge and skill imparted in this course will definitely help anyone to start a business and become successful
I was so much excited when I enrolled for this course, not only because of this was my first online course but also the contents it has. English for business and entrepreneurship has given me a lot of knowledge about the business world. When I started my week 5 class my computer got damaged so I was worried that I would lose all my progress but Coursera account has given me a wonderful opportunity to complete it when I got my desktop back. I am very thankful to each of the members of the Coursera community for providing us with a wonderful space to learn. I am especially thankful to my dearest mentors AMY NICHOLS & JAMES RIEDEL for their instant support and encouragement throughout this journey. I don't know they would read this review or not but I really want them to know how grateful I am to them. And also my fellow members for reviewing my assignments and I really enjoyed learning with them. Even though I enrolled for free  I didn't know this would so much interesting. But for me, the knowledge is more than the certificate. I am indebted to the University of Pennsylvania for bringing this course. Once again Thanks to all. So I give 5 stars.
I really liked the course. The teachers explained very well and I have learnt a lot. The course contains a lot of interesting subjects and helps you to understand more about becoming an entrepreneur. What I missed in this course is the reliability of the tasks and exercises. If you are a serious learner you want to get some feedback from your teachers. This is not included and you get feedback from other students who aren't always serieus. Besides this, the course is free but you have the option to pay for a certificate, which costs €41. Because of my doubt of the reliabilty of this course I didn't buy it. That's a pitty because the course by itself is definitly worthwhile!
Well deserved the five stars. The course falls short with only five ...Huge congratulations to Amy Nichols and James Riedel, great teachers. EXCELLENT all the videos made by them, with images and more icons. All the instructions and samples of the assessments were well explained and organized. I understood EVERYTHING that they explained throughout the course and they did it in an animated way, so that all students were motivated. I finished the course very happy, with many skills in English and knowledge in Business & Entrepreneurship.I am speechless to describe this online experience. Thanks to both of you.100/100.Anabella Sotillo from Caracas, Venezuela.
This course was very exciting and beneficial for me, the platform coursera is very good, I or we ( the classmates) had can write our opinion, ideas, or examples in some topics and give or received feedback about the homework of other classmates even if we didn´t send the homework on time.

It was very great for me because the instructors, Amy Nichols and James Riedel, explained every topic clearly and interactive, I´m really completed satisfied with the course offered by them, and by Harmon Hall for giving me the opportunity to access the coursera platform.
I benefitted a lot from this course which clarified for me several things. Indeed, I learned the fundamental strategies of preparing and thinking for a project plan and project idea. Moreover, the lectures I attended online made things clear to me and facilitated for me the searching operation of my project idea and how to have a strategic plan for marketing fruitfully and efficiently. I thank a lot the course instructors for their great efforts to clarify the skeleton of entrepreneurship and its strategies of success and management.
I thoroughly enjoyed the course, though it was not very easy and little time consuming. But the instructions, videos, quizzes and assignments were quite interesting. They made you think. The interaction on discussion forum was very healthy and learnt to communicate with different thinking people. I would recommend this course to those who wish to learn English skills and writing skills for business proposal. The instructors were very clear in giving lessons, ideas and motivating.
I love this enrollment, it has broaden my knowledge on entrepreneurship. Please how can I apply for a free Certificate, I know I have learnt a lot and I am grateful. It's just the situation of economy in my country now cannot make me afford to pay for the certification.Thank you for making me gain more knowledge during this  global Pandemic .I can Express myself more confidently English and business-wise.Hoping to get feedback from you soon.Thank you in anticipation.
I like how
     the course assumes that the student has no background about the topic.
     Everything is thoroughly explained. It even provides definition of terms. Comprehension Checks are fun
     to answer :) There are plenty of Articles
     to read and there are well-designed, short quizzes after every
     video/topic. I suggest taking advantage of this course if you have plans of starting a small business but never get the chance to do so.
Very exciting learning period! What an interesting insight to the language of business. Having a science background, I never knew I could  learn and enjoy business and Entrepreneurship terms like I did. My dream of being an entrepreneur unfolding. My profound gratitude and appreciation to my tutors for the great impact.Looking forward to obtaining more knowledge with Coursera with my certificates.Thank you.
This course if definitely a great learning experience especially to those who are clueless about the world of Entrepreneurship! This was a great start for me as an aspiring Entrepreneur! Now I'm more confident talking about Business to anyone. Purchasing the certificate was also worth it especially if you're just starting off your career in the corporate world that involves a lot of Business speaking.
Another brilliant course from University of Pennsylvania. I had earlier passed and received a certificate of accomplishment for English for Journalism.  Yet another certificate of accomplishment to do with English for business and entrepreneurship is for a complete cycle. Trust me it was not easy but dedication and hard work never disappoint. Is worth every effort  I have had to put in.
I recommend this course for everyone who are interested in starting business but never learned about business! There are a lot of words related to business, but explanation of tutors and illustration are very helpful to understand the all contents. So, now I know the basic of marketing and can write a very simple business plan. I enjoyed learning the course. Thank you!
This is a highly recommended course for anybody who want to
start a business. I took this course expecting to amplify my English vocabulary,
but I did not only learn new word but a whole structure to start a business. Special
mention to the lecturers, through the whole course I felt how they encourage
you to follow your dream and be successful with your idea.
I will definitely purchase this course! I am just waiting for my salary. =) I tried to finish it and now, I am super happy with everything that I have learned! Thank you so much to my instructors, Mr. James Riedel and Ms. Amy Nichols!Thank you University of Pennsylvania and Coursera! I will keep on studying and apply everything I learn in actual situations.
I recommend this course for someone who works in business area. There are many words that I thought I had been using them correctly, but I was wrong. Additionally, there are many techniques for you to write some important things within a short period of time. I love how they organize this course. Thank you all the teachers and the supporters of this course.
Excellent course,  While there are plenty of courses by doing which one can learn and become fluent in English, this course combines the language skills necessary with basic knowledge required for Business and Entrepreneurship.  The teachers did it in a lucid and simple style, can be easily grasped even by those for whom English is not their native tongue
My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to complete my CV in English to the area of Data Science.  The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.Regards.Jose Antonio.
Me gusto mucho, la verdad es que ya tengo una carrera profesional donde vi clases de ingles, pero esta clase junto a temas relacionados con negocios me ayudo mucho a entender como manejar el ingles en mi carrera. Realmente lo recomiendo y me gusto la tematica de los profesores son muy profesionales y se les entiede el ingles perfecto.
It was a very useful experience for me to follow this course.  I needed this type of course since very long.  I have been working with children studying Enterprise who have difficulties to communicate in English.  These very clearly explained notes, with simple and straightforward vocabularies were very helpful.  Thank you very much.
This course has really provided me with some of the most crucial information about entrepreneurship. I love how the articles are mostly based on study cases. The videos also help us to gain insight into some of the most basic skills that an entrepreneur should have. The English lesson is also integrated well within the curriculum.
This course is highly recommended for initiating your business and entrepreneurship skills. It will give you knowledge in the English language and has additional concepts that grasp your understanding of how business works. Chiefly, this course is extraordinary because the foundation of business and entrepreneurship is acquired.
This course was way more interactive than I thought. I thought that had some tips about grammar and about language in business ( in fact there is ) but it is approached in a way the student would not only learn about business communication but also in a resumed way all the structure of a start-up business and entrepreneurship.
Wonderful course! It is a very nice way to get to know the basics of the Entrepreneurial world and practice your English as well as learn specific vocabulary in this area. Also, the assessments are fun and the videos where the units are presented are beautifully narrated. I am very happy to have done it! Highly recommended.
This is one of the most interesting courses I have taken in years.  The instructors are two of the very best educators I've encountered.  Each day I looked forward to optimum learning with the determination to complete the course in good standing.  Thank you Coursera for an AWESOME opportunity!In appreciation,Anne Cummings
This is my first course on English Language on this platform.  The lecturers are great and syllabus is very systematic. I learnt lots of things here related to Business English. Without my knowledge it's not just learning English but learning business too from startup, bootstrap to business pitching. I am addicted to this!
It is an amazing course for those who are interested in entrepreneurship and marketing too.  It has a lot of new vocabulary really useful for every day.  I love the fact that Americans teach me. because it has really helped me with my pronunciation.  All the activities are really interesting and helpful.  Give it a try!
I had no idea about entrepreneurship before I attended this course.This course helped me understand more about how to plan and start a business as well as it has improved my listening and writing skills.I am glad that I chose this course to attend as this course increased my knowledge in business and entrepreneurship.
Excellent basic course. Teachers have good teaching didactics. The assignments are interesting. I really appreciated this course. I'd like to thank the University of Pennsylvania for offering courses like this for people like me who wants to improve their English skills and entrepreneurship knowledge at the same time.
I really enjoyed the course. It helped me to improve my knowledge of the English used for business and also to organize my ideas and create my  own Business Plan. I would recommend this course to students who are learning English as a Second Language and would like to improve their business vocabulary. Thank you!
I enjoyed working with such talented mentors. Thanks to this course, I improved my English skills, got acquainted with the basic concepts in the field of business and entrepreneurship, got great experience in communicating with native speakers and expanded my horizons. Thank you so much for this wonderful course!
I'm so thankful to Coursera. It helps me lot to understand various things when it comes to Business and Entrepreneurship. It taught me lesson like, intensifiers, word compliments, etc. Coursera also let me develop my own thinking skills. I appreciate the overall help of Coursera to me and to the other users.
It is a wonderful course overall. The course provides an essential knowledge for people who want to start their own business or project. However, the course gives students a fundamental knowledge to the business and entrepreneurship, so students still need to keep developing their skills after this class.
I really enjoyed this course.That was my first attemption at Busiess and Entrepreneurship  but definitely not the last one. The teachers were amazing and were bringing the knowledge in simple language which could be understood by everyone. I enjoyed doing my assignments and quizzes. definitely recoomend
Top-Tier course, The teachers made the topic so understandable. The Quizzes made sure that I understood every part. The language is made so easy to understand. Everyone can do this no matter what country they're from because the language used is simple. I can't believe this is free. Thank you so much <3
For me is an excellent course, I enjoyed it a lot, it was fun, clear and incredibly well designed for non native English speakers, really appreciate that you offer this for everyone.Thank you a lot to the professors, University of Pennsylvania and the Department of State of the United States of America.
This course was very helpful for me, I learned many things in English language and business communication together. All videos were very clear with good volume, synchronize well. There are many quizzes - it was very interesting. I definitely recommended this course to improve English and get much more.
I really felt hard understanding even a basic discussion that happens about business. I also had no clear understanding on the loans and finance. This course is really useful for beginners like me who would want to learn about business. All the concepts are described in a very simple and clear manner.
Very helpful, I have learned about so many skills of how to write a BP, I didn't even notice that there are so many details that I need to pay attention, the tone, the word choices, and sentence structures. I am glad this course is open to everyone and I could take it as a free self-improvement class.
Amazing course.
