The course teaches SQL quite well. But it doesn't teach and make practice about the connection to a database and use of sql magic. Hence, its very frustrating to understand the significance of '%sql' in a Final Assignment review. I think a lot of students are facing the same problem. Hence, it feels like- Final assignment is to check whether we can connect to the database, rather than checking our subject knowledge on SQL.
Horrible experience. The course is not updated. The ibm cloud function doesnt work at all. There are hardly any videos. Most of the content is just theory which you can read from anywhere. Dont waste your money.
Only one star and I think it does not deserve it. On week 3 the assignment  ask you to establish a connection with database and because It gives me an error for more than 3 weeks, I decided to use Forums. After  a couple of dozen messages requesting for help, I received only 2 answers from the professor:First: "Go to week 3"Second: " Idon't see any attachment"I have sent so many screenshots that it is ridiculous. So If you find yourself unable to connect to the database and it gives you a constant error; my suggestion is PRAY!. Please, do not cry like me in desperation after a month. Just PRAY. I think it could work... someday
Using days to find solutions, which are not presented in the course but necessary to get along.
Course is not that informative and it seems in a hurry to complete topics .
too fast and confusing.
Any screenshot referring to ibm cloud is clearly outdated as it does not match with the current website. Instructions on how to get db2 connection credentials are MISSING and the ibm cloud website is not at all intuitive. There is no way to change the default uid/password for db2 connection and there are no instructions either in the ibm cloud site or in this course.I just spent almost an hour trying to solve this problem but in vain. I should not be wasting time and resources trying to establish a stupid database connection.  For $39 plus tax per month this is not only disappointing but robbery!
The videos do not show the proper syntax (there are no ";" at the end of the queries) and pass over concepts quickly. They begin with "After watching this video, you will know how to do a, b, c, ..." and by the end of the video, I can't say I know any of the content presented.The creation of the IBM account was complicated as there are many sets of instructions in different places on the course's page. There was also a mistake in a hands-on lab (which I reported).I would not recommend this course at all.
If I could I would rate this course 0/5None of the resources you ARE OBLIGED TO USE to accomplish the course work. You have to use The console on IBM cloud for DB2 and does not work. You should install the desktop version of the software and it is somehow blocked by US export laws (what on earth should that mean?)Why do not you provide alternative ways to do it?! That's just disappointing, to say the least.Shame on the creators and people lucrating on this product.
Lots of errors. To this course's credit, there was a lot of effort providing practice work in the early material. For the more difficult tasks at the end, there was far less structured practice work. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp this link will come in extremely useful, as will supplementary YouTube videos..
This is a useless course. I've done many courses on Coursera without issues, but I would not recommend this one, mostly because you've got a zero chance of getting any response from anyone if you need clarification or assistance with anything, even completing assignments.
Die Videos sind veraltet und die Plattform von IBM hat sich mittlerweile stark geändert. Ebenfalls treten einige Fehler auf, das ablegen des finalen Testats war nicht möglich, da der Timestam im CSV "Chicago_Crime.." nicht erkannt wird..
Very limited to IBM DB2. Not useful in real world.Very limited and restrictive practice and assinments.For a true learning experience one needs to do a lot of external research and work to show a measureable benifit.
Todos los laboratorios tuve problema para cargar datos y muchos inconvenientes mas que no pude solucionar de ninguna forma y que en el foro de discucion tampoco pude encontrar una solucion
The tools used are not very user friendly, I spent more time troubleshooting them than actually learning. It feels like the instructions need to be reworked and ordered correctly.
This course doesn't work. It relies on IBM Cloud that will spit out an ERROR message with every command, even if you copy and paste from the course instructions. Save your money.
No clue how to find anything on IBM cloud for the last assignment. How can it be so hard to write clearly how something is done? You are changing money for this.
DB2 instance required in the course can not be created due to repeatable service issue and it naturally stops the following courses.
Poor explanation, lack of tasks and bad developing environment provided. I'm very disappointed with this course.
Labs are always down and time out so you are unable to practice what you are learning.... Very frustrating!
There were several problems with the labs for several days,  and the staff didn't offer any solution.
Not user friendly.Errors present. Have to do a lot of work-arounds. Dreading finishing this course.
The IBM Watson Cloud needed for the assessment does not work and I can't use the console.
Boring course. Not application based. No learning by doing. Boring and monoton lectures.
The worst course I have ever done. All participants were confused in the final assignment and the instructions were very poorly organized. Lack of clarity and the instructions being very outdated and incorrect lead to thousands of annoyed and stressed students. Waste of time.
Hi there, in my opinion this course in too short for a beginner and the logic behind the database and relational schema is not very clear. It looks like an instruction book for IBM user, I cannot feel the interaction with the interpreter. But thanks a lot anyway!
This is very much focused on the IBM cloud. For someone who is not familiar with it  will have to spend a considerable amount of time trying to find which is where. Course documents are outdated specifically on creating DBs on the IBM cloud.
If you do not have prior knowledge of DB2 and IBM Watson this course is not for you! The instruction to connect the two programs to complete the final project are inadequate at best. Would not recommend this course!
Not a course for beginners. It advances way too fast and the topics are not explained thoroughly as to truly understand them from a beginner standpoint. Would suggest looking for another course...
The loading data to database and using the database for peer review task took me several days. It was very anoying task. I dealt with time consuming manual jobs rather than wiring codes
Its only about how to connect to IBM DB2. I got stressed out trying to work on the IBM platform. Working on platforms like My SQL is so much smooth when compared to this
Tools used like Database console and Jupyter notebook used also crashes repeatedly. Course just gives very brief introduction to SQL, not much solid content.
Everyone in this course has problems with IBM Cloud credentials. Staff gives everyone the same generic response and provides no real help.
Sadly, this is the most confusing and error riddled course among all of the courses on coursera.
Awful course, with very hard to understand assignments and instructions. Would NOT recommend.
simply the instructions for the final task do not work. very poorly designed course
terribly conducted course. 0 help and support for the programming. horrible.
Labs on IBM Cloud  are not working, it's not a course it's a bad joke!!!
No response to any queries in the discussion forum. Unable to proceed .
Бесполнезно. Всё равно что прочитать оглавление к документации по SQL.
Peer review is great way but it they way it's made it just terrible!
Terribly poor designed course. Video content very dissatisfied.
Very buggy course for it to be enjoyable. Not exactly worth it
I had extremely bad experience with IBM db2. Do not recommend
Rubbish, I don't even understand why its rating is 4.7.
It's too high of an overview and goes too fast.
The data for the final assignment is missing
Very Disappointed by the teaching staff.
can not open the final task console
Not possible to connect to db2
Many errors in this course !!!
Too basic and no that useful
very basic for professionals
CANNOT USE THE DB2 DATABASE
Worst course on Coursera.
The video were confusing.
need 100x improvement
BAD GATEWAY 502
Tragic
If you are located outside USA or Canada, don't take this course. Because IBM cloud DB2 will not give you free account to do the lab exercises. Otherwise you have to pay 202$ to get an account. I didn't continued the course due to this issue.
This course is more about IBM roping you into using a bloated cloud ecosystem, than it is about teaching you SQL.  You will only learn DB2 stuff, and only through their cloud dashboard.  This entire specialization is disappointing, but if you've made it this far, masochism may carry you through it.
No live examples, no tutorial on how to navigate Db2 cloud. Maybe I was expecting too much; disappointed.
Basic SQL, course needs to be updated to reflect changes to IBM cloud (or better yet, don't use IBM cloud). You can find better courses on SQL on Coursera/other MOOC sites.
Lot of errors and lack of guidance
This course teaches you the basics of SQL completely unrelated to Data Science. SQL is not mentioned in any further courses in the specialization. Could have very well skipped this course from the specialization. There was not even a single assignment that involved both SQL and Data Science.
No videos for week 2, sub-queries were confusing and questions 9 and 10 on final project are very 'vague' and 'confusing' with asking questions about Area(s) when in examples and previous course work we were taught to use group by, but correct answers did not use group by.
Weak representation. Full of bugs. No wonder IBM DB2 is not popular
Too much IBM oriented and specific.
There were a lot of problems with the online tools needed for this curse. Staff members eventually responded and solved them, but because of it, I went over my time limit and had to pay another month's coursera fees. Seeing as this is an IBM course and the tools were from IBM, I was expecting a smoother experience
This course is a "Big MESS" to me. SQL they used is completely different. It doesn't accept the normal SQL statements. Column names are case sensitive and Writing the where clause gave me head-ace. It wouldn't accept the straight comparisons. Columns names should be expressed in quotes.I hate this course
People knowing some SQL will learn next to nothing. For complete beginners there is way too much emphasis on using the semi-unusable IBM cloud platform instead of learning SQL. The assignments are also too easy and short, which means you don't get to actually practice the bit of SQL you could learn.
If you know nothing about SQL, don't  take this course since it just a brief introduction without any in-depth explanation. By no means, a beginner can understand what SQL is in this way. But if you've already known something about SQL, it's good for refreshing your knowledge.
This was over challenging because labs and lectures definitely lack decent level explanations to learn the content permanently. I can't say I learned nothing, but I can clearly say this is a below mediocre level of training.
1) Material
and presentation was not engaging and structured2) Final
assignment in terms of administration (copy pastes and screenshots upload)  was a pain in the ass3) Not
enough hands on exercises
A lot of the "optional" materials are actually quite important. UC Davis's SQL course is far superior to this one due to more access to coding practice assignments. I expected more from IBM.
I expected a more detailed explanation in templates. as it was done in the previous course (Python for Data Science and AI). since this database theme is done with many procedures
We spend more time debugging and googling to get things to work than the actual project time. The forum is full of this, but the IBM guys do nothing. This is putrid it tell you!
Would be awesome with a few corrections and updates to course materials- more concise and clear instructions would also be helpful for this beginner level course.
The beginning started simple enough to follow. The learning curve jumps from 0 to 100 in a short time. Not an ideal intro course. The labs are much more complex than what is taught. Instructions how to restart and operate a Run a new SQL was not shown and I had to spend lots of time trying to figure it out on my own. The powerpoints and information are easy to follow but the ease of use through IBM's platform is not friendly. Definitely easier places to learn as I have taken other courses online for intro SQL. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this. I'd either use it in a Free Trial or Audit it. For that value, you can spend your money elsewhere.
1. Lots of the slides have repetitive content, for Ex. different type of joins, Every slide have some repeating lines/audio. Could have taken some different use case or else could have combined it making it a single slide for each joins.2. The "Table Loading Issue" its been a week now I am facing this issue, even have posted in the forum, the solution provided is also not working. Every time I try loading the table in db2 it fails, without giving any error/warning message. I am almost done except a few assignments and final peer graded assignment due to this I am not able to complete my course.
I did not find the course structure, contents, way of teaching at all good.I spent more time figuring out how to upload data on IBM DB2 storage than practising. I feel in this course coursera must look into ways to make it more learnable, I seriously will say, I was unable to learn anything from this course I had to spend alot of time on google and other learning websites to figure out how to code in SQL. In many assignments I just had to skip them because connecting to IBM is very stressful and difficult thats why I was mostly able not to connect with it.
The main reason for my low rating is the following:1. The endless issues with the db2 console - an absolute nightmare to work with if you are not in the USA. Horrible experience. This slowed my progress down significantly to the point where I no longer wanted to carry on with this course2.Not enough practical examples - as a result when doing the assignment, you want to tear out your hair. By my estimate, the Assignment should take no more than an hour if you have worked through everything.
Nice content, but lot of struggles with the tools. Watson studio has updated/changed the layout since the course was created, the content and description of the tasks in many cases don't live up to the real life situation. That's very frustrating, and you can see lots of people experience it if you check the weekly discussion forum. If the tool worked better (and if it would be better descried, as for somebody who never worked in Watson studio before) it would have been 5 stars.
I don't think the peer graded assignment is reviewed objectively based on the rubrics. The reviewer did not leave any comments about my "wrong" answers. I can not find where I did wrong as I already included the required clause in the query statements and got the right results. This is somehow disappointing. Even though I passed the course, but I got a lower score than I expected. I did not get any information about my "wrong" answer.
Too complicated to debug about the IBM tools, Its took me a tone of time just wandering to check password and username and too many errors without any solutions. I quite all the course not because I could not understand the content or could not do the exercises or lab, just because of the IBM tool too annoying, complicated and the instructions are out of date, also not details.
Not great -- mix of SQL and Python that doesn't do enough SQL. I learned a lot of Python just to make simple database connections and run SQL queries -- it doesn't do justice to Python and isn't very helpful to learn SQL that way. The course would be better with just more SQL, and probably not in IBM cloud services.
the instructions weren't very clear and the assignments weren't challenging but they were really tedious.  I stopped part way through the peer graded assignment simply because the questions annoyed me more than challenged me.  IBM can do much better than this.
The sql is easy, but the course makes it complicated for no reason. Instructions are incomplete on assignments, and issues are known to teaching staff. Ends up wasting 3 hours of time trying to solve known course issues.
Need to update instructions and screenshots for the ibm cloud site. Instructors dont respond to many questions in the forum and when they do their answers are often breif and vague
There were a lot of troubleshooting errors that I realise, were not only unique to me. These errors were not addressed properly and I ended googling some of these Issues
The course has big technical issues that slow down the completion. I am quite disappointed by the application utilized in the course. The course lessons are good.
DB2 is out of the marketing not many people want to learn it, maybe it's time to upgrade it to something latest
The use of IBM cloud was really frustrating as it was very slow and didn't work most of the time.
As a serial course in the "specialization", it's too simple, just made the learning path longer.
The content is adequate but I found it a bit boring. The classes did not keep my interest.
Please review this course assets! especially IBM DB2 cloud service's availability !!!
The cloud system has so many problems which will prevent us to submit our works.
so many stuff are out of dates and some instructions were very unclear.
Very poorly done.  Not enough information on working in the cloud.
every material in course not match interface of the programs
Not suitable for non computers background students.
WHY FORCE ME USE THE IBM CLOUD? SO COMPLICATED
The IBM tools are so unfriendly to new users
Last few lessons are not clearly explained.
The voice-over makes me wanna sleep.
The Lab env sometimes has trouble.
Expected more from an IBM course.
needed to update many topics
hard to use sql server
not well designed
very simple
I would've given a five-star rating gladly, if it weren't for the terrible user experience of IBM DB2 Console, which wasted 4 hours of my time trying to load three small csv files into database tables.Apart from this "blocker bug", the course is well-organized and worth the price.
I can't open Db2 console on the IBM cloud, it only showed 502 Bad Gateway. It cost me more time on finding another way to finish the homework.
Although the material was clear and concise, working with IBM Db2 Cloud was a headache due to its  unresponsiveness
In case IBMER's fails to have DB console lite access, its difficult to complete the assessments, hence there should be other alternative to  practice it.
The lectures were confusing at first, because the syntax in the lectures did not exactly match the syntax for the assignments (though this issue went away in subsequent weeks). More exercises would've been nice. In all, a decent course.
Guidance is not sufficient. Questions are not answered as needed.
Week 1 was fine, however I want to complain about the way teaching was handled for week 2.I am a visual and kinaesthetic learner which means that i really struggle to absorb information audibly, this is fine as in ALL previous courses of the IBM professional certification there are videos supplemented by reading materials and guided labs (I can listen to the videos, and then work my way through the labs to gain understanding of the videos.)In this course, specifically week two, you had the video, and a lab that had the instructions "do the functions stated in the previous two videos" TWICE.This is, to pardon my language, total garbage. You are a teaching device who apparently has not bothered to attempt to teach anyone as you can't be bothered to write a brief PDF stating what you want us to do. instead assuming that we will do all the work regardless of whether it's helping our learning or not. I am sure this works fine for some people, for plenty of others it does not. I'm rating this as all my previous IBM data science courses were very nicely made and acommodated all learning types.I think it's a crying shame that one week has been allowed to be so much worse than the overall level of the course.
This was probably the worst course I have ever taken on coursera. Unless you have at least some basic SQL experience, DO NOT take this course. And if you are in the specialisation which requires this course, do some basic SQL from somewhere else and then come to this course. There are a lot of problems with the datasets when you try to load them into the SQL database server in IBM DB2 and most importantly, the video explanations are too hard to understand. They explain most of the things which aren't really important and don't explain things that really DO have some importance. I'm pretty good at SQL myself (said by my cousin an SQL Database Manager for over 5 years) but I still struggled a lot with problem 8, 9 and 10 of the final assignment. Any moderators seeing this, when it is possible, I beg of you, please fix this course. If I hadn't faced any of these problems, this would be a very fun and interesting course. So what happened here? Everything is explained to us like we have mastered the fundamentals already and are coming back for a revision. Truly very disappointed with this course.
I think the course needs a bit more structure and written labs, some of them just tells you to practice what you´ve seen on the videos but I think it would be much more effective if there were more labs with specific problems to solve.Also in some of the labs some solutions are given without explanations and those havent been even mentioned on the videos or the readingsThe forum is not as effective as the previous course I did of this specialization, teaching staff takes ages to answer, and also answers are not satisfactory.Anyway, the content is interesting and I have enjoyed learning
Decent course for an introduction to SQL. Basic commands were introduced well and the Jupyter integration was great for practice.But the course was a little too basic; could have had more application-oriented content and a steeper difficulty curve. In addition, the Analyzing data with Python video from week 3 had about 1 one minute of voiceover that was completely unrelated to SQL or databases. The voiceover was just about Sodium in Nutrition. Felt very unnecessary.
This is a shallow introduction to SQL. Python API is shown, but not used in the assignments. The videos are OK at best, and many times, the examples are not the best, in that they don't really show why one would use, say, a left join instead of full join operation in real life. The earlier weeks need more exercices. However, the final week is quite good. At least the exercices and final quiz makes you think a little.
I wanted to like this course more, but wow was it dry. There were a lot of small nuisances with having so many logins to access course material that made things frustrating at times. Although, the point is to get you accustomed to an IBM centric workflow, that when you start to learn it, its not bad. I did enjoy the final project, and found it to be the redeeming quality of this course.
Though the course content is good and covers the essential portion of SQL and also lets you try your skills on real-world data, the course video feels outdated and monotonous and makes it less interesting to watch. In Majority of videos, the instructor shows screenshots of code and its output instead of running which feels utterly passive.
All in all an ok introduction to SQL, have found other courses much more insightful and easy to follow. Course felt too fast at some points for someone without a Computer Science background. Too much attention on how to do things on the various IBM tools and writting SQL using Python rather than learning SQL itself.
overall good course but my issue is that there are no notes provided to review just the videos and the labs, notes would've been a great addition to this course..also there is an issue of incorrect grade given in the peer reviewed assignment, i hope this gets rectified because it ruins the fun in learning.
Lecture slides are required. Please note that so much being taught in a small video may slip out of mind and to quickly go through so many syntax would have been possible only if lecture slides would have been provided.It is not possible to look back into videos again if i want to confirm some syntax.
The information in the class is outstanding, the problem is IBM Jupyter Notebooks' kernels fail within 10 minutes, and must be reloaded constantly. The final exam requires 10 answers via Jupyter notebook trial and error, and it took me nearly 3 days of constant refreshing to get this done.
This course is not a complete overview of SQL by any means. You will only learn the most basic functions.  The value here however is that the course guides you on how to write SQL queries in Python. To round out your SQL skills, you will need to take a more in depth beginner course.
The course content is very good. The so-called teacher-student "communication" is dreadful! I would never imagine that paying money for the course, I would be so explicitly ignored by the teaching staff for weeks! I even passed the deadlines due to multiple tech problems.
Some quizzes include questions about materials not yet introduced. The material could be much more interesting with more interesting and interactive examples. Hands-on Labs should include new materials rather than letting the students rewrite given queries in sql.
Some of the instructions in the course are not as clear as those provided by other Coursera's courses.  There are some sections with outdated screenshots and typos.  This disrupts the learning process and requires extra time to guess and sort out the materials.
Decent course. The SQL code is somewhat different and you need to practice it a lot. I do not think you get enough practice to really know SQL just from this course. There is only a few labs and even in there you only actually type a little bit of SQL
Less / inactive response on Discussion forums. Lots of issues that has been reported over months but not fixed. Course content is good. But Week 3 assignments, which was important for me, took ages to finish owing to error on  practice environments
a few issues on the assignment which lead to a couple of extensions in the deadline, adding a month extra to pay for, Not all the screen shots were the same in the demos as the interfaces have changed slightly. apart from that a good course
The videos were very very hard to follow. The voice over that has been used for the videos is very hard to follow, but once I made my own notes and read the content from my notes, the content itself was contained a lot and was very useful.
Great course content and pace however the downfall was the IBM Developer Skills Network Labs and the IBM Db2 on cloud..Both these systems were extremely glitchy even during my Final Assessment and support in the Discussion forum was slow
In the intro to data science specialization, this course is a relatively steep step up from the previous one 'Data science methodology.' Perhaps obtaining some basic understanding of Python prior to taking this course would help
Overall the course provides the concept of SQL and a great picture. Just with technical issue in the Peer-Graded Assignment, causing spending loads of time to find out the solution, which those time could have been saved.
This is a course with a lot of information, but the tutorial is not complete, resulting in a lot of time wasted in the debugging environment. The problem is difficult to solve, which makes me very frustrated
If you have zero knowledge about database and SQL...this should be the right course for you..like me...however, i feel like the course is not very structured and lack materials like questions and exercises.
First student did not check my submission at all gave 0 for all of the questions. I really felt sad because I did correctly for the project. I wish Coursera will do somethings for those mean act.
the course is good but the way they teach you is not as good as other IBM courses it was  bit confusing for me where to write the code etc the instructions were not as clear as they should be
Useful course,  but the instructors aren't engaging enough in my opinion. I only really felt interested right at the end, when I was trying to work things out in the final assessment.
Could not get the dataset from the assignment, always threw xml error, had to go to some other guys github profile who completed the course, thank fully he attached the dataset used
Not super clear and struggles a bit with accessing and connecting to the DB2 I think the examples should match what is on the assignment and really break down the query language.
The speaker in the videos goes too fast. The hands-on labs are very useful and were my primary sources of learning. The videos didn’t help much with the learning process.
The environment is difficult to set up. For someone who knows SQL and has worked on other platforms the IBM Cloud and workspace are difficult to set up.
The course is good, but i think that you will provide a platform to practice while watching the videos. In some examples the data base is not upload.
A little to none explanations, very easy quizzes.  Low quality slides. Good if you  want to remember lines without understanding what they are doing.
Learnt a lot about connecting database from python and how jupyter notebooks are useful.Please mention IBM DB2 only, if it covers only IBM DB2.Thanks
The lesson and video itself is okay in general, but the bugs for the labs and assignment is what makes this course very annoying and time consuming.
Getting the right syntax for Python and SQL together was really tricky/difficult. I wish there were a reference book/website for additional study.
The basics were easy.  The hard part were the instructions in the course didn't tell you all the steps that you needed to do to launch the labs.
Some of the documents which are referring to IBM cloud are outdated. Otherwise this course is really good some one like who is beginner in SQL.
Instruction is overall pretty good, but there are some gaps. Final assignment and tech issues can lead to a rather frustrating experience.
This course was OK, but I'd still like to see more hands-on exercises and a final assignment that's more aligned to the prior coursework
Assignment marked by other classmates is not a correct method. classmates often do not read answer carefully and give a correct grade.
Does a good job explaining SQL queries. But the final assignment has to be designed better. There are too many repetitive questions.
The last exercise of the last week is not clear how to do it and the server does not run it. There is no assistance from the forum.
It's nice and it  teaches you about SQL, but it lacks practice exercises and sometimes is oversimplified and can be too easy.
Great course for learning how to access Cloud Databases using SQL commands with Python! not so great if you are new to SQL
Once on cuts through all the challenges using IBM cloud, the learning was great. Glad I know so much more about SQL now.
The final project might need to be reviewed. So much time was spent trying to load one of the .csv files without error!
an unnecessary emphasis on using ibm tools which many times don't get interconnected is a big turn-down.
A good starter course with good insights for those who are new to SQL and using Python for Data Science
It has the most basic about databases and how to connect python with an database instance on IBM Cloud.
More practice questions required for practice. needed more elaboration on Db-Api part of the course
very short course sql should be needed to be taught in detail but it was just basics of the basics
video content and explanation - 1 starcourse structure - 4 starlabs and assignments - 5 star
Learned a lot, but lacks useful practice for real-life application outside the IBM cloud
The labs did not all connect to the IBM cloud correctly, otherwise the course was fine.
The course teaching methodology is not user-friendly especially for someone new to sql.
This course is really only useful if you have zero backgrounds or experience with SQL.
Not as strong as the other offering in the specialization.  Slide need a bit of work.
I have many problems when I do my assignment, I think the class don't teach very well
In this particular course, I was having a lot of issues with the IBM technologies.
I wish there could have been easier ways to learn this course outline. Very hard!
This is a logical extension of the certification, but the interfaces are clunky
Good content, but issues with the IBM databases/servers slowed things down.
Overall the course is satisfactory although some areas still need work.
Need more real-world data on hand practices.  Practises makes perfect.
this course is good for learning mysql with python and ibm cloud
Interesting & Challenging. Gr8 course but not for every soul.
There are not enough exercises and  videos are almost usefull
Easy to follow. But not explained why should it be in detail.
It is a good course to learn SQL and Python interfaced DBMS.
Good course, however, it uses a lot of IBM specific tools.
Videos in each week can be repetitive and/or overlapping
Need more practice and less IBM advertisement =)
The exercises should be more challenging.
Awesome course. Please also provide job.
dude make the course a bit more human
found it a tad bit challenging
Not up to the expectation
exams are not challenging
Very confusing at times.
More SQL needed.
averge course
ok
Overall good course but a few typos and unclear instructions, mostly with the labs and our own 'user specific" DB2 specs which were needed for the 1st and 2nd lab - yet, clear instructions for doing so were posted several labs afterward. Labeling of individual labs (their titles/ filenames, when opened in Jupyter notebooks, did not correspond with the actual weeks in the course that the should have - wks 2 were called wks 4 and wks 3 were called wks 6) That made it a bit confusing at times. They appear to have been from a different course or earlier revision. Maybe revisit and revise this course soon for better flow. Also, please check the comments/discussion boards and address those concerns that are repeatedly coming up. Quite a few more students than just myself were stumped or confused over the same issues. Thank you.
Worth all the effort..! Great coursework if you're willing to spend some time to understand DB2 infrastructure,creating Db2 database on IBM Cloud, compose and execute SQL queries, and access a database from Python based Jupyter notebooks. Key takeaways from the course : 
- Creating databases on IBM Cloud
- Troubleshooting basic loading errors
- Working closely on creating tables on real time IBM DB2 instances
- Connecting to db instances using python and perform basic data summarization
- Performing data loading through RestAPI's
Videos were good length but automated voice-over, learned SQL in the context of their proprietary Db2 database. To their credit, the lectures were fairly short but contained enough information to take notes and learn SQL, and I finished the course in a short period of time. They don't babble which is nice.
The course is very helpful and easy to understand. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because learners had to deal with many technical issues which were not relevant to the study, while doing labs and assignment. The upside is I guess it is part of shaping the right learning attitude. Many thanks!
Good course with practical exercise, however some problem on lab exercise connection
please give details on how to connect database with notebook
Of the courses in this professional data science certificate I have taken, this is probably the best designed one. The labs force you to think and apply what you learnt in the video and not simply make minor modification to example codes. By the end of the course, I have internalized some of the commands. Overall, the labs were rather effective at drilling the concepts into students.Some of the labs in the second week were rather lazily written. Instead of asking students to practice what they saw in the videos, all labs should contain actual questions that ask students to apply what they have learnt to new examples and problems, forcing them to think about what they have learnt.The grading system is also in need of improvement. Some graders do not seem to know what they are doing. Simply resubmitting the assignment can result in a drastically improved score simply because the first grader was marking down answers that were actually correct. Perhaps there could be multiple graders assigned to any single assignment and the average score taken, or something to that effect.
This is a great course and I particularly appreciated the integration with Python/Jupyter notebooks. As in previous courses in the IBM certificate program, the labs were the highlight. They challenged students to answer questions using real data sets. Going from start to finish - from sourcing and downloading data all the way to analysis - was very helpful in mastering all of the techniques. A couple of sections felt out of place: in my opinion, the optional database schema topics could become a separate course of their own, while the section on joins deserved more attention. The lecture slides, with the pictures of interconnected tables, were a bit hard to read and could do with an upgrade. Overall though, great pacing, with easily digestible videos. Highly recommend.
I propose you to put all the option chapiters in a advanced certificate for this course.It was  "a long journey" for me but I was motivated to complete this class.Thank you very much.I do love your videos and the Hands on lab. Please note that before taking this class I knew nothing in coding in sql and python!But now, I appreciate it and find it very easy to understand!!!! I'm sure that your good way to teach this class using all the matreials has contribuated to help me!I m going know to buy 2 books: for more advanced knowledge, one  in sql programming and the 2nd in python for data science!!Thank you very much👌👍👌👍😍😍
This course is good for anyone who is a complete beginner, new to, or looking to refresh their knowledge of Structured Query Languages (SQL). Ideally would have liked to have a lesson on optimizing SQL queries since many queries become inefficient for data tables with very large row counts, but I understand this didn't make sense since the free IBM DB2 database they have you set up has a size limit of 100 MB. No need for optimization with data this small, but it's still something they should have at least mentioned in the course as an optional lesson. Overall, nice course for learning or refreshing SQL and database concepts.
The instructor and course materials are very good! But the peer reviewing for the assignment is NOT well-organized, as one problem in my assignment was not graded correctly, and obviously it's a "trembling hand error" made by the grader. Coursera has in-built mechanism to prevent such error: it uses median grade for each problem as your grade. But this mechanism only works if each problem is graded by enough students, which is not the case in this course based on my observations in the forum. I would suggest the course designer to require each student to grade at least three assignments before they can earn the certificate.
The class was very enjoyable and very easy to follow. My only complaint is that if the final assignment is going to be assigned such a high weight, then it should require more than 1 person to review it. My assignment met criteria to receive full points, but the person who graded mine clearly blew through it and assigned me partial credit where I should have received full credit. I still passed and enjoyed the class, but it was frustrating to successfully complete the assignment only to be dinged by some inattentive grader.
4 stars only because I think the intended coursework is pretty good but to be honest the execution is pretty average. The course will be much better if the mentors are more active in the the discussion. Right now the discussions in the forums are mostly driven by the students in the class and it will be better if the supposedly mentors are move involved to provide support. Some of the courses in edX are pretty solid in this area and I think it really adds to the overall learning experience.
the peer assignment took awhile b/c you had to do the hands on assignments in the cloud to get in and try in python. Already know databases and breezed through it all except for the submission could not figure out how to get into the cloud and where to type in the sql within python. The syntax stated "%%sql". It was %sql <query> on the same line.  Learned from many earlier in discussion group.  Another had the same question about invalid syntax and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
Please let me know why wont I receive my certificate upon submitting my assignment?Why do I have to wait for reviewing someone's assignment.Moreover I have reviewed two other assignments still I did not receive any certificate.I would be applying for a job interview where I would be needing my certificate asap but there has been this problem. Try to get rid of these problems.The instructor or the staffs are late to give responses to any problem.Please look into these issues
Would highly recommend the course, online learning
material very good. Had connections issues with SQL server. Techy background helps. Be prepared to be
patient and tackle
technical  connection  and
speed issues when running SQL queries. No course documentation warns you
of  the potential problems and the time estimates to complete the  weekly
module/tasks need to ignored.
Monitor support weak as can be seen by the non-responses to questions in the
forums.
Apart from errors in the open source tools for the hands on labs, this course is fantastic and well crafted to introduce Databases and SQL. the optional sections are useful for those without good grasp of knowledge about databases and their types. make sure to take them. The labs are good, but always there is connection problems. If they will fix this, it will be one of the best introduction courses out there.
Upon initiation the course does cater for people with no background with many exercises. Maybe a small introduction to python would do, just to teach the people abit on python because with assistance from youtube there are always different methods to approach the problems. Maybe a clarification of problem questions should considered. Some questions are really hard to understand what is actually asked for.
A great course about SQL and Databases but the final assignment should have been about writing python code to access database and analyze data, as shown in one of the videos where a pandas dataframe was created. Instead, the assignment made us write SQL code inside Jupyter Notebook. That was not needed at least as far as I am concerned. If we had to write SQL, we could have just done it on IBM Db2 Cloud.
As someone with zero experience with SQL, this was a solid introductory course. At the end of the course I understood many core SQL concepts and was even able to do some coding without any help. The only negative aspect I experienced was that the course used some functions that only exist in the IBM cloud that the course uses, but this shouldn't persuade someone to not take this course.
it is a very good course that I have learned a lot from, however, I got confused in too many situations when trying to run queries and complete assignments. I dont know why but instead of trying to type the proper query, the course pushed me in a way to find the proper query somewhere, copy it and that's it. A very positive point was the amazing support and quick responses from Rav.
Very good course as an intro to SQL. The materials is presented at a good rate and there are good lab exercises to practice what you learn. The final assignment really puts what you learned to the test. There is a section in week 3 about APIs that lost me and I had a hard time seeing connecting it to the rest of what was being taught, but otherwise a useful course.
It will be better if instructor could provide more tips or attentions or common mistakes on using SQL, for example, when retrieving string results from multiple tables and joining them together, their format should be exactly same, or there will be no value though the syntax is correct. Then we will avoid wasting more time on trail and error.
I enjoyed this class. It was interesting and gave me  lot of hands-on work with SQL that i needed.   That being said, there were quite a few moments where I had to dig deep into the discussions to figure out how to get stuff to work with the IBM DB2 Cloud.  The text/video was not up to speed with the changes to the IBM console/setup....
A good introduction to SQL and Databases, informational and easy to follow. There is a need to update the instructional material in the course to be in-line with the current IBM cloud and DB2 set-up page, new user will be lost due to the inconsistency between the instructional material and actual web page of IBM Cloud and DB2 set-up
Dear IBM Program People,Great Course. I would have preferred not waiting up to one month to get my final assignment reviewed. That makes irrelevant the efforts a student makes in completing the course as soon as possible to start learning other courses. That is the only reason I give 4 stars. Best Regards,Pietro
Some automation in the final submission review may save time. Especially where answer is a objective type. For the subjective answers always peer-review is a good option which is in practice. Otherwise, it's a great course helps someone to start their journey in SQL with exposure in IBM cloud space.
A good, but shallow, course for learning basic SQL and Relational Database concepts. Good for those looking to learn the fundamentals and start working hands-on as soon as possible. Those looking to learn beyond the basic should look for other sources in concert with, or instead of, this course.
I want to share my experience with coursera is really awesome and the course i completed Databases and SQL for Data Science is also best for my carrier and have a best content to learn DB and python. so go for it. course content is not so long or not a so small so you can lear hear very easily.
The course is very excellent however I have faced an issue with IBM DB2cloud .At the time of final  assignment submission it was not working and always showing 502 bad request ,So I have faced little obstacles during completion of my final assignment.Otherwise the course is brilliant
Good course with very useful and valuable material. However, there were times when there were issues with loading data to work on assignments. Additionally, IBM updated their cloud system, it can be challenging to follow the course directions because they are not up-to-date.
Peers need to understand the description and the submissions to review the assignments. I have been reviewed as not attempted for Problem 7 and partially mark for a completely correct Problem 9.I don’t want any person who cannot understand the questions and answers.
It is a good introductory course for individuals who would like to understand the the basics of how to work data (Load data into a database, query for relevant data using primary and foreign keys from different tables) and understand the fundamentals of SQL
well done excellent work i am giving four because you need to improve in the areas add important points such as the schema to be used in the assignment  should be similar to the connection made and time stamp should also be included in important section
This course offers a good first overview of working with SQL and database systems. It relies a bit too much on external IBM tools while a more general approach, with the open to get introduced to IBM tools, would be more appropriate.
I took this course to refresh my SQL skills. In general, this is a good course, but I think there was a little practice. It will be more useful for students to be required to do more tasks and assignments for asessments.
The course provides an introduction to SQL but some arguments - such as basic syntax - are only presented and not explained in-depth. On the other hand, the second part of this course features very interesting labs.
Issues with DB2 loading tables apparently due to different versions was the only technical problem encountered by myself several others (see forum) made me loose a lot of time. Otherwise this is a great course.
It will give you an idea of what can you do with free databases resourses using sql to manipulate relational databases. you'll also utilize jupiter notebooks to query data connecting the notebook to a database.
Course is god enough. However the last assessment is not. Misprints and not clear questions lead to disappointing marks in the end. Also other students marked assessments based on their understanding.
A very useful course with some very interesting datasets/Jupyter notebooks to work through/practice your skills. Offers a good balanced blend between theory and practical/practice. Very good course!
Covers the basics, but might be a little difficult for a complete beginner. Manageable, but difficult. Needs more help using SQL within a Jupyter Notebook which should be in the earlier labs.
Overall is a nice course. It was a bit confused because Handson Lab related to each other. It would be nicer to have a short remind from previous labs or better to keep labs independently.
Course was well organized, I found the lab exercise to be useful in learning the material.  The quizzes and final project were fair and tested my knowledge of the concepts.  Great course!
I liked the way this course is structured and I am really happy with the kind of exercise it contains. It would be really great if more details regarding the python script was provided
Good content. I have learnt a lot :) Please improve the uploading files for the tests. There were several loading errors coming from the files which should not happen at this stage...
There lack of guidance for those who get stuck. The instructors are not available to guide. The discussions might look helpful but they consume our time or say waste a lot of time .
The course starts from the basics but progresses to intermediate level concepts in SQL, like joins and subqueries, which are required for day to day work in the Software industry.
This "Databases and SQL for Data Science" course was good. I learned too many new things and it really helped me by providing fundamental knowledge regarding databases and SQL."
This was an excellent course even though it was challenging.  I was able to move from introductory SQL to Intermediate level.  I really, really enjoyed the practice exercises.
A really good course. The lab assignments improves the efficacy of the course and enhances your conceptual understanding of the requirements of cloud databases in data science
I am so much glad to learn Databases and sql for data science and completed my certification.I strongly recommended this course who does not know any thing about database.
There are many technical issues in IBM Watson Studio but due to the availability of peer community, the messages in discussions helped me a lot to completed this course.
need to to updated. details regarding IBM cloud is messy and outdated. take to long to connect the cloud. videos slides are of bad resolution. instructor voice not clear
Not bad, but for me, again, is to many online tools. From my point of view, some Docker Compose with the prepared container(for bd, for notebook) will be more suitable.
Course was great but RDBS in browser was so slow that i need to wait for couple of minutes to create a table. Thankfully, doing the same in python took few seconds
Tough start, really boring material and I hoped I never needed to work with SQL. Later though it started to click a bit better and was (slightly) more enjoyable.
This course is best for beginners to get started with the database and sql with ibm cloud. But the content can be improved more as the assignments is concerned.
Teaches pretty well for people like me that had none previous knowledge in SQL.I think that could tell a little bit more about SQL outside the IBM platform.
I feel the videos could be more explanatory and should explain some of the concepts a bit more in details. Rest everything was good especially the labs.
I personally already knew a lot of what was covered, but I can also say that they did a great job of explaining SQL for someone who has never used it.
Troubling loading the crime.csv dataset and there was no much support from the team. One has to search a series of options which wasted a lot of time
the line fir writing code in jypiter notebook were limited to one line,therefor writing code especially in the final assignment was a bit complicated
Very useful hands-on labs looking at real-world data sets.  Some of the learning material seemed overly complicated, or I would have given 5 stars.
Excellent course for a beginner to learn in detail if we put a little extra effort, as well as  experienced person to learn to work on real data.
It is a great experience after all to learn extracting data from multiple tables with subquery & implicit join.This is definitely something new.
This course is good but little bit fast. Videos needs to chunked down as too many things get covered in single video without proper practice.
Un bon cours concernant l'usage du SQL. Il reste nécessaire de s'appuyer sur des ressources extérieurs pour appréhender au mieux le langage.
Great course with very useful and cohesive content. The IBM db2 software is a bit slow and difficult to access but otherwise a good course
Best Course so far in this series. The labs in week 3 and 4 are especially good, with lots of problems to solve on real-world datasets.
A good level of complexity with enough tutorials to understand it all. Though, sometimes they were repeating something several times...
The IBM DB2 database was very buggy and unreliable.  I spent much of my time waiting for the database to perform simple computations.
Some instructions could have been more clear.Overall communication could be done better (if it's needed).All on all, i am satisfied.
this course was awesome i learn many things related to database and in jupyter environment in python and access data through cloud
It would be great if things got covered in a more structured manner. Week 4 is so damn confusing and took a lot of precious time.
CRIME.CSV file had an incorrect setup (date format), since that part was not part of the learning I think it should be corrected
The database SQL MODULE IS REALLY HELPED ME.BUT final assignment was difficult .There is no interaction to resolve my problems
Lots of good material. Much of it is a commercial for IBM. Directions for operating within the IBM data structure is outdated.
Good course, came away with a solid understanding of basic SQL.  The assignments and project were helpful and fun to complete.
A great and solid introductory course to SQL. I recommend it to those who want to aquaint themselves with databases and sql.
the course is not bad, but for the beginners who don't know anything in this course some lessons are not clear to understand
In this course basic was easily explained and it was great course. but wanted to learn more about sql lacked in this course
Feels like lectures are being give by an AI instead of an actual teacher. Also some things get repeated in several videos.
The additional activities helped a lot. This definitely sets you up with the fundamentals. From there it is all practice.
The first course I have encountered with lots of labs that make you research and engage more with the course material.
This course was good and gives me a clear picture of how to connect python with databases and perform SQL operations.
It is extremely Good , but it should contain some more  information about the sql i personally think that, thank you
Great content! Highly recommend for those needed a DB refresher or beginning a journey in the field of Data Science.
Great course! Gives a Solid Foundation. But would have enjoyed it even more if it was more intense and challenging.
There are some errors in course ending assignments, however, generally course covers most of the important topics.
The course is pretty easy and basic, but well constructed and very useful for those who want to get to know SQL.
Not a bad course.  Not real intense.  Sometimes instructions are hard to follow but good for a casual learner.
Cognitive labs is a good platform, but it is very unstable, making progress in the course longer and slower.
Good course material - would suggest finding a more viable solution to grading assignments than peer-review.
Good method of teaching and easy to understand content and language. More Practice labs would be appreciate.
Very good course. However, I didn't like the fact that this course uses just the DB2 framework of IBM.
Course Was awsome but The Ibm Cloud On which LAb Depends And assignment depends Gives A lot of error
The content is clear and useful, but the videos are not attractive, so it is hard to pay attention.
Great course. Very challenging and stimulating. However the grading by peers is sometimes unfair!
Very useful course to learn SQL for we beginners. Thanks for such a wonderful course organization
The course is good, but there are lots of code which one cannot reproduce in other environments.
It will we more helpful if they provide more live examples  with every execution of a  SQL query
Week 4 was a bit intense and I think the topics could have been decompressed over one more week.
Lots of hands on skills.  Some mistakes in the Notebooks make some problems confusing, though.
I found week 3 a bit confusing, but otherwise it is a very useful and well explained course!
Exceptionally good course to begin journey in SQLDiscussion forum has to be more responsive
I found, sometimes, hard to use DB2 warehouse, so i prefered using other types os database.
this course is much more about basics so i highly recommend it to people who want to start
Great introduction to SQL. But the course forces the learner to be dependent on IBM Cloud
The material presented in this course is valuable and worth the time and effort to learn.
It would be nice if there is a module on different type of databases and their properties
Improve the difficulty of the course. That's it other than that, it's an awesome course.
This course is good for beginner...but there should be more quiz..anyway good experience
The lectures could be quite challenging to understand due to the technical jargons used.
decent one for a intro course. bit of high level programming language is really helpful
Well structured and communicated. Assignments were an appropriate level of difficulty.
Good tolearnSQLcommands, but the excercises were a bit too basic and did not progress.
Make this more interesting.Issues with IBM cloud while loading data into a new table.
Very easy to understand. Overpriced. I would give 5 stars if it was below 20 dollars.
I am not quite cool with the guide to grade peers. The exact answers were not cited.
The content is nice but ibm cloud was really hard to work with. Always very slow :(
It was a nice course and the best part of it was interacting with real world data
I have learned more about SQL after the course, but we need to practice more
I was expecting more difficult queries, both in the lessons and in the tests
could've used more practice/labs but the course was great overall. Thank you
In week 4 assignment my jupyter notebook won't connect to the ibm database.
A great course to equip the learner with foundational knowledge and skills
Very basic course that teaches you the bare minimum of SQL to get started.
Really help me to re-understand basic SQL. It's suitable for a beginner.
Well explained, but both the quizes and the final project were too easy.
Great Course, the addition of some more practicals will be appreciable.
Course content is very good but faced problems while running IBM's DB2.
some repetition and some instruction for log in and setup is outdated.
Datasets could have been proper. column names are too much mismatched.
i have not done any SQL for years! The course help bring it all back!
This course is good for beginner which has little knowledge about SQL
Covers all basics of SQL and methods of accessing of SQL with Python.
I already did that in the feedbck. It is Good I enjoyed a lot.Thanks
The course is really good for the beginners who want to learn SQL.
Materials are very easy for me because I have learnt sql before...
The materials are good but it is difficult to get help if needed.
good to learn about new function of phythone and data analysis
Would have liked to learn more about connecting to other DB's
Very basic. Good introduction to SQL with Jupyter Notebooks.
its interesting course but need to add more practical lesson
Good Refresher Course and I like the Final Hand on Exercise.
I little more exercises my be useful for beginners like me
a good intoduction to RDBMS and data manipulation with SQL
Very usefull for beginers. Week 3 and Week 4 are awesome!
Good course. Tutorials for IBM Developer could be better.
Good course for beginners and very good practice content.
Um, equips students with the top range basic  knowledge
faltarían algunos ejemplos de Oracle y otras databases
excellent course with real practical implementations.
This course is the best one on this specialization.
Great course!, just a bit fast paced for beginners.
quite nice intro into databases and sql for newbies
Covered all basic concepts about Databases and SQL
Good basic course,even to brush up on main topics
There are not enough assignments for us to learn.
Good for the basics - will help getting into SQL.
Video content could be little more interactive!
It was a very basic course though learnt a lot
Good Introduction and Training on using to DB2
课程不错，基本的SQL语法都讲到还配合了练习。只是在使用IBM DB2的时候还不是很熟练。
He tenido problemas con la herramienta Labs
i haven't received my badge for this course
Good. But I have expected it deeply diving.
Very nice contents with proper sequence...
The peer graded assignment can be modified
Very good intro to SQL but not too indepth
Well explained the concepts with examples.
More detailed information expected in this
The content and practical labs are great.
A couple of fun visualisations in Week 3!
THis course is a Best fit For Beginners
Great course to get to know about SQL.
One of the best in this specialization
Course is well organized for begineer.
not bad databases and sql for science
It was a very knowledgeable course.
It's precised and well explained .
Good material but still too simple
Great introductory course for SQL.
A lot of videos that talk at you.
gets hard really fast from week 3
Muy buen curso!. Muy recomendado.
Well organized for introduction.
Good work; a very good course.
it was good for basic learners
very good course to learn sql
i am very plesed to have this
Nice Environment to learn!!!
wish it was more challenging
Very good base to start SQL!
Nice Course for SQL Practise
The Assignment was too easy
Good basic overview of SQL
GOOD FOR STARTING WITH SQL
Claim Badge not received
Good for SQL beginners
A decent course on SQL
SQL magic was awesome
Good for basic SQLs.
wonderful experience
need more examples
only for beginners
Very informative.
Good job by IBM
Can do better.
Great primer.
Bit too easy
tons of bug
zbs
This is a great review of an important topic. If I knew how much this mattered for the advanced capstone course I would have paid more attention. As it was, I came back here frequently.
This is definitely the best course so far on the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! I have been very keen to learn about SQL and Relational Databases for a while and this course enabled me to achieve that objective, in a fun practical manner. I was challenged all the way through and cherished being able to spend time making mistakes and learning from those mistakes in the hands on lab environment. 10/10 course and if the author of this program ever decided to make another course extending from what was taught on this course, it's safe to say I will be the first to sign up!!
Practice lab assignments were excellent in reinforcing my learning, they were just the right kind of challenging. This course has been the best one in the Data Science Professional series by far.
One of the best course I completed on Coursera. All the learning material is well organised and easy to understand. Also the non-graded sections regarding relational databases are interesting.
Really right to the point and efficient. Good examples and short direct videos. I had no idea about SQL before and now I can run good queries and have enough tools to learn even more.
The hands-on labs were extremely engaging and the quizzes were very informative.
Highly recommended. I was a newbie for mySQL and this course offers a good entry point and insights for database and SQL. The final assignment could be somehow challenging for people without programming experience, but the discussion forum is active and the course instructor Rav is very attentive, responding to questions in the forum. I solved some problems just base on the search funtion in the forum. This is the best course I learned with coursera so far!
Amazing course for beginners! The entire course is well structured and has good hands-on assignments. SQL is extremely essential for Database management and fun learning so please do try this one out!
The lessons were short and easy to follow, providing all the basics as well as a few more advanced topics, to get student quickly up-to-speed on databases and SQL and their application in D/S realm.
It's my first course at Coursera and it's quite good. By this course now I'm able to partially working as data analyst soon to be working as full-time analyst.I'm very thankful to the instructor.
So far in my journey through the IBM Data Science Professional certificate, this course is the best as it contains more practical lab questions after the lectures.
it is a great course for beginners who wants to have an understanding of Database concepts and hands on experience as well
Amazing. The difficult in the SQL is very good to make you think in real life problems.
its a must skill for everyone into data science field
I actually liked this course. It introduces you to all the basic SQL commands (select, aggregate functions (min, max, sum, avg), joins etc).  The labs enable you to create tables in the DB2 database (=the IBM database) and query them from a Jupyter Notebook. I have my own Jupyter Notebook installed , however, you can run and practice queries on the IBM environment as well. Then I liked that in the final assignment in week 5, the last problem 7 was a bit challenging ( I spent some 2 hours on this problem alone! searching the internet and the course forum. As a result, I did memorise how the INNER JOIN command works!!). The rest of the problems really had the same simple commands as in the labs. Finally, I received a helpful response  from Rav Ahuja, the tutor of this course, the following day after I posted my question. I liked that rather than giving me a ready command, he pointed me to a general solution to this problem (in case I encounter the same problem again). Overall, I'm impressed with this course.Hint: please save your log in credentials and the link to Dashboard-IBM Cloud from Lab1/week 1, you'll need to use them many times in other labs and the final assignment!
Though compact, the course doesn't seem to miss out anything on Databases and SQL as far as a new programmer like me is concerned. The instructor is awesome and so are the videos, readings and labs. Nowhere you would feel that prior experience with programming is a must to assimilate the concepts taught in the course.Programming is a hurdle for many who aspire to be a Data Scientist. So this course would definitely provide a solid ground to people new to programming but gritty enough to be a Data Scientist and would help them in realizing their dream. The course is well desined, and specially well taught and the team would have really broken a sweat to make this course what it is. Loved it!
This course is very helpful to learn SQL fundamentals and to implement it in IBM cloud platform.I am belonging to a poor family and i was very much  interested to learn database management system   and Coursera provided me the perfect platform to learn Databases and SQL for Data Science.  I would recommend all of you people who is interested to learn SQL to start with this course because it provide depth fundamental  of SQL.  Thank you for providing an perfect platform to learn SQL.
I had never worked in SQL, so this course definitely provided me a good grounding on database handling. I do not have too much experience with pandas library of python, and this course provided me some hints on deepening my understanding in pandas, and the logical connection between pandas and SQL. It was also good to see the techniques which can be applied in Jupyter notebook or in python code itself to use SQL commands.
For someone who had learnt SQL back in High School, this course provided me valuable information on some of the more advanced topics and gave an insight of working with real world databases.The basics are taught from scratch and the use of database on cloud made the learning more simpler.So if you want to learn about data science i'd recommend this course and also to those who have some basic knowledge.
This course from IBM does a great job bringing all the basics of SQL and concepts around Relational Databases. And since this is from IBM, which offers Cloud Computing services, the course involves some simple basics of using Cloud services to create databases and interact with them. SQL languageRelational Database ConceptsBasic Python codeCloud Services All of these are all helpful from this course.
Best class so far in the IBM Data Science Cert program.  Well done and really get to working with SQL for data science usage.  Has a good intro on SQL and the essentials commands you'll need and then dives into working with datasets and writing SQL statements.  Good pacing and the lectures get to the heart of each topic.  Labs do a great job of following up on that.  Make more classes like this one.
For a beginner it is an excellent course. Step by step hands on examples help one to negotiate and learn patiently.  Now I have much better understanding of why DBMS is so critical and how one has to use the cloud DBMS remotely. How the tables are created and the significance of Primary and Secondary key. How the queries are run. How to do the joins to handle data from multiple tables.
Its a very good course. It has both video lectures & hands on Lab simultaneously make learning effective & boosts confidence of a learner. Some issues with lab like unavailability of them due to technical issues makes thing somewhat inconvenient. But coming to learning, course is very good. I would like to thank the instructor & coursera also to provide such opportunity for students.
I was basically a newbie coming into this course. I was not great at SQL, and relied heavily upon others to handle writing queries for my reporting. Now, I feel like I can handle quite a lot, and can logically piece together anything I don't yet know. The class covers all of the core fundamentals through joins, and even covers ibm_db api to run queries using Python. Excellent course.
Classes have been short and very helpful and descriptive, and the hand-on lab practices give a perfect chance to practice all the stuff whatever we learn so not just concept but we get practical experiences.. however the assignment was a little tough but without hard work and getting stuck it will be worthless learning. Just wanna thanks all of the creators for such a great course..
The course is very good and informative. I have been facing one problem nothing with the course actually I had subscribed for the IBM professional Certificate for Data Science. Having completed this course has completed the set of specilization of introduction to Data Science but I have only received the certificate for the specializtion and not the badge. Kindly look into it.
This course is an excellent material for those who want to learn or excel in the field of DATA SCIENCE or more particulary DATABASE part of data science and perform various operations on large data persent in the from CSV or other file formats, by loading them into DATABSE and manipulating on analyzing data with help of  some powerful progamming languages such as python.
A good course to learn basics of Databases and SQL so as to facilitate analysis and visualization of data to make effective decisions. I thank the professors to make this course interesting and worth it. Only thing is, videos can be made in a better way so as to facilitate people with non programming background. Maybe some basics of programming would help.
Very good course with a lot of nice practical Labs.Can't understand negative reviews on cloud solutions not working or missing information for the final exam.The db2 database from ibm cloud was working fine and If you thoroughly go through every lesson, lab and exercise, you are perfectly prepared and able to do even more, than is needed to pass the exam.
The course is a real blessing to my data science. This is the most interesting course I have done in coursera series. I commend the organizers - IBM and the coordinator for a job well done.  The course is not focused at setting a hard exam exam, but on procedures to solve real world problem. The cloud computation is also interesting and encouraging.
Course is good for any novice who wants to start with basic understanding of  SQL.It also covered database connectivity with python.From my side i would like to recommend that course material should include some string functions like instr, substr and handling null values, as these are frequently used functions when working with any dataset.
Totally recommended for those who want to learn about the key aspects of relational databases and SQL for Data Science. The optional labs that are offered in the course are really helfull and have relevant information too.  In my experience, in this Specialization Course I found the key aspects for developing a Data Science project.
The course is pretty good and consists of step-by-step classes which learn us basic skills we are going to use and evolve in our real job: what is a query, how we can use and create it, how to obtain data from a database, how to check out some particular data from a database, and so on.Many thanks for such interesting course!
It was so hard to work with Pyton, because I did do it before. Oh,... I missed this job (work with SQL)!Thank you for these course! It was hard, boring when you don't understand something (or can't fix your mistake cause you can't find it! (haha) ), but it was a real good time for refreshing my memory and learning new ways.
This course provides good basic knowledge in Data Base and SQL (Structure Query Language). Even i don't know anything about Sql but after taking this course i got basic knowledge and to practice sql queries IBM itself provide their database DB2.  I would say thanks for providing such brilliant  course IBM and CourseEra.
I express my gratitude to the organizers of the course. The course was very exciting.
I discovered a lot of new things in working with databases. This is a new science for me. I realized that I need to deepen my annia in programming. Now I plan to take your Python for Data Science and AI course.

Thank you good luck
The best taught course in the Data Science professional certificate curriculum. Everything is aptly incremental, every question, every slide, every week. You wont click the next button and be surprised by the information on that page! Unlike the other courses I didnt question myself - am I supposed to know this?
This course is the most interactive learning experience I've had on Coursera. Thanks to the brilliant teachers from IBM and the great course they provided. The most memorable thing was the labs where I was able to experiment the knowledge myself. Would definitely recommend this to anyone starting to learn SQL!
I am a beginner when it comes to SQL and relational databases so the course is just right. It may feel a bit boring at times but that's the nature of the subject not how the course is written. Some repetition is good to refresh memory. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone new to SQL or Python.
This course is really amazing. With hands-on lab you will be able to master in SQL. I would like to recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn SQL from the beginning as well as to them who want to improve their SQL skill. Thank You, Rav Ahuja and Coursera for providing such valuable knowledge.
It's a great opportunity for me to learn Db2 on IBM cloud using Python, Jupiter notebook, SQL and relational database. Example cases, practice lab and final peer reviewed assignments are brilliant!! Thanks courser for developing this interactive module to learn database and SQL on Db2 platform.Ashfaque
I wanted to learn a little bit of everything about SQL queries and I found exactly what I was looking for. The lessons were quick, packed with information and challenging. When I combine this knowledge with what I have already learned in Python I feel like I am well on my way to bigger projects.
Great content. Delivered in a format that would get you from no SQL knowledge to querying real world data sets in a few weeks. Off course, as with everything, you would need more practice to develop your skills. This course definitely provides the foundation for that additional practice.
very good course and lot of labs to practice yourself..if you are new to database or sql then this is for you it has some extra information explaining some of the jargons used in database system.I'am just a fan of Coursera and the way of teaching, i am very satisfied with this course.
Brilliant Course, I have learned so much and found a new passion for SQL. The best part of this was the real world data that we work with and the way the hands-on sessions, particularly the ones in Week 4 are. They guide you in a way that you learn how to develop queries...great fun.
Der Kurz hat mir sehr geholfen, mit SQL Datenbanken mehr vertraut zu werden. Besonders hilfreich war die Mischung zwischen Theorie Input und den Hands-On Labs. Somit konnte ich erste Erfahrung im SQL Queries schreiben sammeln und mit den Tools für Datenbanken arbeiten. Sehr gut.
Databases and SQL for Data Science is great course for all those, who are eager to learn SQL. It was great a experience to run a SQL Query on IBM Cloud also on Jupiter. The course content covers almost every corners. I will highly recommend this course to anyone wanna learn SQL.
In-depth course for SQL. This was very well planned understanding the mindset of a New Be. One needs to practice the concepts like once in three days to be on the toes. Thank you Coursera and all Professors who made this possible! Hoping to meet you again on the next course.
A while back, I had taken my first Database and SQL course in university so this course was a great reinforcement of my existing knowledge while expanding on some concepts and using new tools I was not familiar with. So thank you dear instructors for this excellent course!
Phenomenal in-course assignments and notebooks to test, learn, and try out code with in-depth instructions (read: screenshots) and explanations! The videos are also really helpful for understanding databases and the "save note" function is well done. Thank you IBM team!!
The course is an excellent introduction to SQL.All the materials are provided to you, so all you need is a computer and an internet connection. I think you can get the most of it if you are already familiar with some basic concepts of data science and data structures.
This was a nice course and I learned a lot. Knowing database language is must to beome sucessful data scientist and this course will teach you everything you should know to gey started with sql. I highly recommend this course to enroll and learn something from this.
Very good course for SQL and Databases. Goes through the concepts of Databases, SQL, how to access data from Databases using Python, and SQL Magic. The course content is good and the labs are amazing. Anyone who aspires to work with Databases should try this course!
I liked this course. It was really informative and helpful. I would like to see you guys coming up with another course teaching about how to collect data from different sources if it is not readily available as .csv file.Thank you for this wonderful course.
Liked the video material (from IBM Cognitive Labs) which provided a very good conceptual understanding of relational databases and SQL querying language. Also useful to understand how to query a SQL server on the cloud (in this case IBM Cloud) from python.
I learnt have easy is to set up a database on ibm cloud and load data set. Also I have refreshed my knowledge about SQL. I found the labs very entertaining and the topics in the video very well distributed :) Thanks for the work done in making this course!
Muy bueno y completo, se integra los conocimientos de modulos anteriores y se tiene un buen reforzamiento de SQL.Asimismo, el usar el Skill Network Labs junto con el IBM Watson Studio  y el servicio IBM DB2 on Cloud es una gran experiencia de aprendizaje.
This course covers all required basic of SQL. Although I was aware of basics but I leaned connection to database from Python. Access data using various libraries in Python. I really recommend everyone to take this course to start with Database in Python.
There are a large number of practical examples which reinforce the theory thought in the video lectures. Would highly recommened doing the optional parts of this course as well as it will benefit the person taking the course. All in all a great course.
A good and elaborate course for beginners. Hands on lab assignments are better than most of the courses and Mr. Rav Ahuja and team have been spot on in covering the core of the topic.A great stepping stone to start off data science using SQL
This had some great overviews of using SQL with Python and also got me to connect with an external database. I don't have a lot of SQL experience, so some of this way review for me, so I can't speak to someone that is less familiar with SQL.
I am very happy that I have completed this course. I find this course useful for office needs, all the sessions were very interactive, meaningful and easy to understand. Solving real world problem was fun and thoroughly enjoyed this course!
This is a very good introductory (and maybe even intermediate) course on SQL (with and without Python/Jupyter). I only miss more reading material to avoid going back to the videos - maybe the slides could be made available after each week.
I loved the training and the material as well. The only thing painful was doing the peer assignment, you need to take screenshot and then upload. It would have been easier if we could have just click on the Submit in the juypter notebook.
Awesome course to gain practical knowledge of using databases from the cloud with a jupiter notebook. The course was really helpful and helped to gain an overview. An increased thirst to have better knowledge/grip on the user perspective.
While this course is a demanding one, it is also quite interesting and well loaded with deep knowledge. I enjoyed every bit of it and I did not mind the time I had to keep up late some nights running Jupyter Notebook and querying data.
Great introduction!I had no experience with SQL at all. This course helped a lot in understanding many details about RDBMS.I can now do many useful queries and have a head start when start to read a RDBMS book to deep my knowledge!
This problem is excellent , i've totally no experience in programming but i still can success for the assignment ! be patient , re-watch all those videos , it will help you to understand the sequences and your assignment needed!
Although I have previous knowledge about SQL and databases, I have worked on Oracle 11g as well but by doing this course now i am able to connect IBM-db2 API with python. I have learned how to code in python to access databases
Definitely recommended. Great course, good basics, and assignments. But, IBM Cloud throws random errors sometimes when you try to open the db2 console (402, 502, 404). Just refresh it multiple times. Should solve the problem.
This is best platform to improve your skills, i got to much practical knowledge to work forward for my career. i would highly recommend everyone , who is reading this, go for it. You would thank me later for recommendation..
This course has great technical support and good material. The lectures are informative and understandable. I first met such a quick feedback from the course technicians. It 's a great cloud lab experience. You 'll like it.
This course starts with the basics and gradually covers most of the topics in SQL. The hands-on lab exercises are extremely useful and give the learner a good command over practical applications of SQL+Python architecture.
I enjoyed learning about Data Science and the use of Cognitive Class Labs, IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud, IBM DB2, Jupyter Notebooks and Python.  I am looking forward to subscribing to the Professional Specialization next.
This is an excellent course covering end to end SQL and python/Jupytr notebook integration as this forms the basis of data import going forward. The Ungraded labs and Final assignments were really good hands on practice.
Probably the best course in the specialization thus far! Notebooks provided are invaluable to learn how to interface a jupyter notebook with IBM cloud. I had not found this information elsewhere in such a concise manner.
The course was well structured and elaborated. It was a combination of hands-on as well as lectures on essential concepts of Databases with knowledge on using IBM DB2 in IBM Cloud. This was a really helpful experience.
A very comprehensive and introductory course in SQL and data science. If you have no background in SQL and interested in learning it, you should take this class. And the specialization that this course is in is useful.
This course is exceedingly practical and knowledgeable of SQL commands, IBM cloud database Db2, visualization with python on Jupyter notebooks. Thanks so much for IBM, the instructor, Coursera for building this course
I like the practice in this class. Playing with real data is so interesting.SQL language is not so complicated itself and with enough practice I feel that I understand how to combine several queries in proper order.
Great Course, polished my skills on SQL. I must say it s a challenging course. I've previously completed SQL course but it also teaches you how to connect it with IBM cloud which is I think is a great initiative.
The only comment is that the usage of DB2 of IBM may not be available all the time. So, suggest if you can mention other tools that can be used locally on PC to help student to follow up and complete the tasks.
The most serious and closest to professional course I've taken on Coursera so far (out of about 20). Both fundamentals and real-life practical skills are taught in a plain and clear manner. The Labs are great.
Great course! I learned the basics of SQL. Wish there was a more in depth discussion of SQL and its capabilities, but I received a great base and it helped me remember everything I had forgotten from college.
Excellent introduction to SQL as well as using SQL within a Python environment to query data. Provides a solid background in basic database management and utility, as well as a good transition into analysis.
This course gave me all the basic knowledge of SQL that I should need for Data Science. It was so well explained that it even seems too easy. Thank you so much for this great opportunity to gain knowledge.
Learned a lot and offers a lot of real-world tips. I started this course as a beginner and couldn't be more thankful for this course for giving me a wider understanding of SQL and writing in the language.
That was an amazing course that I really improved my programming skills for data science in Python as well as SQL databases. Really like practical parts of the course which most of the part is practical.
One of the best course I never studied before. I'm really happy with what I'm learning and experiencing in this course.Thank you very much for your endless effort to make joice in people's life like me.
An appropriate course for the beginner. Introduce the basic queries statement. And the most useful point is instructing how to use DB2 and how to start SQL in python. The DB2 is fluent and easy to use.
Good opportunity to learn essential and fundamental SQL skills. The most important part of this course is that it teach you to use SQL and Python together while getting familiar with Database concepts.
Awesome Course!!!! I learned a lot about IBM Watson, SQL queries how to connect to API, and more of Jupyter Notebook. This course is strongly recommended for those who wants to become a Data Scientist.
Excelente curso, aprendí relativamente rápido los conceptos básicos de SQL desde 0 y conocí el uso de Python a través de Jupyter Notebooks, habilidades aprendidas son de gran uso en el campo laboral.
