An interesting course, but some external links didn't work, and it's impossible to create an account with IBM Cloud, so there's no way to do the final exercise. A bit of a waste of time.
The instructor of the course didn't do much other than asking a simple basic question at the start. And this course was just an interview of what some experts think what AI is.
Too many bugs. Most Assignments are not in sync with which is being taught. Few videos do not open even after finishing the course.
DId not feel like a course, just like a bunch of articles strung together.
Very poor course that give no tangible skills.
Why I did not received badge for this course?
i want to drop down this course
it should be more informative
more of opinions only
no women featured :(
As someone who has produced educational content for complex software for enterprises, I think the content and materials for THIS module could have been structured and written more efficiently and more effectively. I would strongly consider rebuilding by focusing on goals and objectives for the course and streamlining content.  I actually had to skip this module after week 2 and start on the next courses (which were much better) for the specialization/certification and come back to this course thereafter to finish.
A poor branding effort on the part of IBM. Watson trial account link does not work impeding learners from completing assignments and passing the final review. The hands on Watson experience boils down to a very basic "product tour".
sound was very low in most of the interviews. Content doesn't give much scientific depth. Some Watson exercises were not working. exercise guides need to be updated in-line with the most recent versions of the websites.
I liked the course and learned a lot. However, I found it really disappointing and annoying that it was apparently easier to find an teenager for the interviews than one single woman who could talk about AI.
Third course done in Coursera, and this was the most disappointing one. Many interviews, nice chats, but not so much content. I was expecting some more theory/practice, not so much documentary.
Very disappointed by my peer review for my final. In the future I will make sure not to mention anything beyond the set curriculum and turn in my test several days early.
It was all really basic. Could have been done in just 1 week, everything.
Some nice background but most of the course felt like a sales pitch.
It's too informative rather than being a teaching course.
Very basic course! Nothing productive out of it as such.
put some more teaching stuff
It is ok
I think if we are talking about Introduction this course is pretty good but as far as AI is a concern it is just a sample.
The hours calculated to complete this course are not exactly accurate.  The method does not include taking notes and having to go through material(s) more than once. The course could have had some better visual examples. The course could have offered ACTUAL counterpoints (not just in name) and discussion of those counterpoints regarding A.I. in our lives....(as people are not choosing to do this).
It's a good course if you don't have any idea about IA. It'll give you the most important concetps and the bases to start your own researchs.
Though, the definitios are given by IBM Experts, and they have different concepts by themselves.It would be great to be homologous in the information and teach a course with set information and not only with a personal opinion by the experts.
The delivery format of interviews, on the one hand, and speech-to-text generated slides is monotonic.  The interviewees repeat themselves.  There is a strong bias given to the Youtube AI expert.  I found the hands-on exercise to be interesting, particularly the graded one with the image recognition.  There is lots of extra material provided for continuous learning.
Its a good introductory content on AI however, it is not really a course but more like a session on AI- where you are getting to see interviews with key AI torchbearers. As a stand-alone I would not recommend however, the full 3 course curriculum may be beneficial
There were way too many lecture videos and not enough practice examples through Watson AI! The lectures from Tanmay Bakshi were monotonous and repetitive! Please bring in more "industry leaders" in AI for lectures and interviews in future!
A very basic course just explaining what AI is and what it can do. The course gives the most basic of basics and necessary I feel for the intermediate topics. The readings have to be made better
The first week gives you important terms from the AI world, and explains it beautifully.The rest of the course may be interesting, but has nothing to do with actual learning.
Very nice course. It gives the basic idea of AI. But something missing in this course. The course not gives that detailing that I expected. Overall a good course.
Excellent Course But Some where IBM Watson VR Application not working ...I spent one week time just to analyse the Images
Good for super basic intro level course. Too many generic talking-around in the interviews from my point of view.
It was a lot of interviewing the same people.  I wold have liked to have walked away with a deeper skill level.
the course focused more on therotical knowledge instead of practical knowledge .please make it more practcal
It's pleasure to listen to the different angles of AI by experts with different examples.
It was a simple course, little insights for AI were taught but it was not a deep dive.
Just IBM Watson Ads for the majority. Little actual content to learn
Some interesting content, but mostly just advertising for Watson.
Some technical error and some updating some content is required.
Bit helpful for beginners to know about AI and it applications.
This course is good for introductory of Artificial Intelligence
It would be better if hands-on sessions are with coding part.
Need more content-related material and foundational concepts
This is a nice course for beginners in AI Development.
An acceptable and fairly educational survey of AI
its just basic and very less info oriented
Ur here finally.. 3 years of chase
It was an OK introduction to AI.
it think week 4 could be shorter
Good knowledge on basics of AI
Good for getting an Overview
Good for new learner of AI.
THANK YOU.
It's an excellent course for beginners. My suggestion is that the course should talk about the failures of AI to date. I recognize that data collection is still a big issue, and that AI will not work as robustly with limited data. That was the experience that IBM had in implementing Watson in the healthcare field. There are stumbling blocks (which people should be informed about) and challenges ahead. Thank you.
This course provideded me with the knowledge of the most basic AI terminolgy and gave me a good introduction to some of its main applications. I may not be smarter after this course, but I feel much more enlightened and prepared for discussions about AI. That's g
The course is a good overview of AI application and  potential uses.  Content is focused on the use of the Watson, the IBM AI platform. No programming is done.  It's appropriate for non-coders.
the course is more on oral explanation, it is good to hear from professionals and their vast experience.  for a beginner this is more than the enough to kick start
Very helpful to gain fundamental overview knowledge about AI, however I do think the course overly emphasizes on the services provided by IBM Watson.
This is a good introductory course for understanding the basics of Artificial Intelligence for someone who does not have a deep technology background. The basic concepts like what is AI, ML, Neural Networks etc are explained in a way a lay person is able to comprehend. In terms of improvement, I would like to see the speakers talk about specific use cases of AI in a bit more detailed way so as to help one understand what and how AI comes into picture and what it does. I felt the examples were at a very high level and lacked specifics.Otherwise, a good learning course to get started on the AI journey.
It's a very insightful course! A great start if you don't know anything about Ai and want to learn what it is all about. It gives you an overview of what it is and what can be done with it. The interviews are a good idea but I didn't like it that the interviewees were always turning their head towards the interviewer and never looking at the viewer. You only see the side of their face. I stopped watching them and only read the transcripts of the interviews. Otherwise very recommendable.
This was a very informative course and covered the topic from various angles. I liked the fact that it combined interviews with direct learning sessions and assessments. The speakers where very knowledgeable and generally came across well. Tanmay is of course a standout.One area of improvement would be the "Next up" text prompters that seemed out of sequence. Would also enable an auto-play function so you don't have to click so many times.Thanks.
This was a great overview of the current state of the field of AI, and where innovation is likely to come form and be directed in the future. It lightly explores several avenues of application and research, and points out the skills one needs to develop to get involved. It could potentially be more in depth, a few of the early weeks felt especially light, but it is definitely a good first course in AI.
Content is quite good. Nice intro to AI, however, the last assignment had major issue. The snapshots of the guide vs actual interface for IBM Watson were very different. Several students were stuck including me. Despite writing on the forum several times, no one from Coursera came up to help out. In the end it was self trial and was finally able to complete the course.
Decent introduction in very broad terms of AI. Sometimes what is said in the interviews is inconsistent with other videos. The course focuses mostly on machine learning, which isn't surprising, but I think it is a shame that they didn't at least spend a little more time on other areas of AI, and at least have had ONE person who did non-ML AI work for their interviews.
Good general overview. Some of the most interesting/helpful videos went a bit too quickly to really feel like you had a handle on the material, but with an existing background in AI I was still able to do well in the course. I took this as the first course in a specialization, and hope but do not yet know if it will set me up for success in subsequent courses.
A nice and clear introduction to AI. I would've liked a little more technical details of how it works, but in order to build a good foundation in AI, I understand that knowing how today it permeates our lives, how it's gonna be its future and how is important to avoid bias and talk about AI's ethical concerns is key to have a complete view of this topic.
The course was a solid introduction to the concepts and excitement around AI, with some notable voices and clear content. A few other elements would have improved it: a reference guide such as a glossary, slightly more in depth exercises, and a brief history. Some of the content was a little repetitive and the above could have been substituted.
Thanks to Coursera for giving such a wonderful opportunity to utilize this covid period. The videos were really awesome. The courses you provided are from beginner level which will be understand for every learner. These courses are ruling the market now and in future also they were demanding. Hope everyone join in Coursera and learn something.
Thank you dear Coursera faculty. It's been an insightful course with intriguing resources for excellent content and brilliant materials. But gently, one thing was unexpectedly disappointing, not being able to communicate easily with instructors. I'm sure they are busy making it possible for everyone to learn. Peace to you all.
While the training video materials are great, the videos most of the time has background music thats really taking away the focus from the actual material presented. I am not saying it shouldnt be there but should not overshadow the material thats being presented. Perhaps it can be a LOT less louder.
This course provides a very solid overview of what AI is and what it is not.  Even though i have training and practical experience in machine learning, I found that the instructors spoke a little quickly at times, particularly when they were covering more complex topics such as Neural Networks.
The resources were good. I wish it had been more interactive and engaging at times though. Also, in all of the interviews, there wasn't a single woman at IBM who could have spoken about AI? I think this is why some experts are concerned about bias towards the progression of AI.
Excellent course to get started and learn the basics of AI and Watson. One thing I would add to the course is the learnings from previous fails with AI, it is useful to have some red flags from start to be able to avoid them or design in such a way to mitigate known risks
I had earned a great experience after going through this course. Got my fundamentals of Ai right and lectures were quite insightful and enhanced my knowledge about different applications of AI like NLP, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Chatbots, etc
I loved every aspect of the course. It was delivered in bit-sized chunks that one could consume without choking. You could also go back and review concepts that required more careful, considered, deliberate thought. A stunning accomplishment!
Good introduction. I got an overview of AI. A bit confusing was the use of Watson, since the pictures used for guiding through are from an older version. Some folders did not exist any more in Watson. But it is manageable at the end.
Interesting, insightful course but I think you should definetely try to include a female perspective in the course. There were no female interviews even though you did include links to interviews with women working in the field.
This course is very helpful in learning about AI . which i don't have basic knowlege about this one helps in gaining relavant technical terms related to the Ai  ,Machine Learning ,Data Science, Deep Learning/neural networks
This course gave a basic overview of AI like the benefits of AI, Problems, Conflits, active research areas, future of AI.It does not include any coding, good for those who want to know what is AI in a general perspective.
Me ha parecido muy interesante para empezar a conocer algo del mundo de la Inteligencia Artificial. LAs personas que intervienen parece que tienen gran experiencia y aportan su conocimiento además de su opinión sobre el
It was a good start for a complete newcomer like me. I was able to understand the reach of AI and also its limitations and challenges. My aim is to develop a career in AI. Hence I will try to learn more courses of AI.
The course content was very engaging and informative. Rating four stars due to the Final Exam being a Peer Reviewed item. I felt like the grade was lower than it should have been based upon the requirements.
The peer to peer grading at the end isn't very efficient.  There was only one project to grade and it makes me worry that my project will take a long time to get graded.  Other than that I loved the course.
This is a good course to get you started with AI if you had no previous idea of the same, also it does a pretty good job of explaining the most basic ideas, terminologies and technologies behind AI !
Good introductory course, would be great a more detailed view of the IBM Cloud platform and how to create your on project and do your own AIs, but understand that was not the purpose of this course.
Course is satisfactory and creative way of new method of teaching process that helps every one to understand theoretically and provides hands on online lab practice session with various IBM tools.
This course was very helpful in understanding the basics about the artificial intelligence . For those who wanted to pursue higher degree in AI for them this course is the right choice.
A little too much reading for an introductory course like this. While the articles are inspiring and thought provoking, the length might be a tad too much for most beginners.
I believe the interviews are very useful and to have different point of views, but from my perspective,I would like to have this kind of comparison in an slide format
Its good for understanding the basics of AI and the theoretical part of it. Its does not involve any type of coding and thus helps to form a good base for the same.
The course provides a brief introduction into AI, but the grading process for the last assignment is dependent on other students witch doesn't work that well
I have gained to learn a lot from this course and i am very satisfied with the assignment patterns and also looking forward to more such courses on Coursera.
Good intro, explaining  different concepts related to AI. Quite generic though, so more useful for people that are not familiarized with AI or Data Science.
Some of the ethics chapter issues seem to be rather non-academic, which worsens the course experience a little bit. Otherwise a great introductory course.
Good Course.Very well understood. So many myths of AI has been remove from mind.Course really incredible.IBM Watson is amazing. IBM clod is also good.
The course is very informative and well organized apart from the last IBM homework. It is not clear and the system does not work, which is not clear.
Creí que estaría un poco mas orientado a Python. Error mio. Por otro lado es un muy buen curso para conocer la AI, sus variantes y sus posibilidades.
It gives the good Basic Knowledge About the AI . Before starting any thing about Machine learning or any branch of it you must study This courses
The course provides a great introduction about AI.  The views of experts provided in the video contents are very enlightening and great value to
Overall a good introduction to AI. Some of the images in the instructions pertaining to IBM Visual Recognition are outdated.Thank you
It gives a good overview of basic concepts behind AI. It does not go into mathematical details, but it is still good for beginners.
Basics of AI but if you know a little bit about the programming and the maths behind it I would recommend a more advanced course.
I like the overall structure and content of the course. However, I would definitely have enjoyed some more hands on exercises.
Great for someone who would like to get an overall picture of AI as a whole; someone who has absolutely no idea about it....
Excellent course for those who do not anything about AI and would like to learn and understand more about it. Good job!
Basic course for beginners. Will be good for managers and non-tech persons. Quite simple for experienced developers.
It is a good course if you want to gain basic knowledge about AI with a lot of examples and tools provided from IBM
The content was good but the peer review system is not good enough since some people don't evaluate you properly.
This course help me to get the general concepts of AI and the terms related to it. Thanks to coursera for this.
It was great experience and interesting to utilize AI .I am assure AI  will bring revolution in new era.
It is a good introductory course, but sometimes it just shows subjective opinions with no deep analysis.
A great introduction to AI with some really interesting talks from subject matter experts in the field.
This course is very useful for beginners, but the dictator should be slow down the pace of speaking .
The course was great except for the peer-graded exams. You can't control what others might grade you.
Very good course for the introduction module, as clear and gives some examples for entry in AI world
it is easy to learn in coursera all matirals are provided for the topic best way to gain knowledge
Very good course for a beginner.Opens a new door in the path of exploring AI with strong basics.
It is quite informative, motivative and simple for starting and for getting a clear sense of AI.
Es un curso intoductorio, no está mal, pero si andas en este mundillo muchas temas ya te sonaran
good for gaining a basic knowledge of AI. all theory part like what is Ai, it's applications
Almost theoretical but helpful in clearing basic concepts. kudos to creators of this course.
This course is a good overview of the status of artificial intelligence at the moment.
Great course to go through the A.i In work field and expectations from future of A.I
Interesting course I ever looking for. I expect continuation of this lecture course.
Artificial intelligence is a set of technology that allows us to extract knowledge.
This course help me a lot about AI and the applications of AI in different fields.
Thanks to IBM for providing free course which will be more useful in our career.
This course teaches some interesting topic about AI which is in the beginning .
It will be much easier to follow if there is a bullet points after each video
At times seems like an IBM commercial good introduction to basic concepts.
Best learning about AI with different specialized methods and team mates

The course design is excellent specially for beginners to study and understand the basic concepts in Artificial Intelligence. The lessons and course material are perfect and apt for this course-level.
Great Module to understand  basic AI & how it will be useful . Watson lab was worth doing, it very interesting how AI is classifying the object in picture. Will be doing next module shortly.
This course was so interesting. I have actually visioned a little robot i can communicate with.  I think I will take this a step further and explore more with AI.
This course has helped me understand Artificial intelligence on a broad level. With practical examples, I was able to relate with the concept in a better manner and relate with its application
This course has piqued my interest, now I cannot get enough and aim to complete the entire specialization.
Very beginner level, but the interviews were very good
My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11) I did this course to get new knowledge about AI as a Coursera Beta Tester and Mentor, and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to IBM, Coursera and  Teachers.Regards
This course content was wonderful. I have learned more idea of A.I. with the latest applications. I wish to move forward with an A.I. career. Thank you for such an excellent certification course.
Its an great platform to learn the INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI)  in Coursera i have learned new things related to ai and Watson Studio by Ibm cloud was Awesome Experience to me..
Best course for foundation of AI and to explore applications of AI. It provided me very clear understanding of ML, AI, Deep Learning and mathematically advanced concepts.
Overall, a great overview of the general concept and field of study that is AI.  It was enough to get me excited, for sure.  NEXT!
This introduction course is a great way to start your way in the AI world. It gives some advice that will give an idea to newbies on what to learn particularly they recommended to learn math and stat.
It was really an amazing introduction to Artificial Intelligence course with lot of discussions that matter a lot in this field for learning more and more applications of Artificial Intelligence.
I had a great time learning about AI, the different techniques used to train systems, and where AI is used in the real-world. This has undoubtedly sparked my curiosity in wanting to learn more.
A very useful course for a novice interested in the Artificial Intelligence. The course gives students the basic concepts about AI and also hands-on IBM labs to exercise AI techniques.
This is highly informative, easy to understand. The videos make it more interesting. Tests and assignment are good and really test your understanding of the subject.
Amazing introductory course to get insights about different underlying algorithms and some possible pros and thought so cons associated with future of Advanced AI.
Loved this foundational course - very informative, engaging, and gave useful real world examples of the benefits and challenges in AI perception and deployment.
I absolutely loved each part of this course, the interviewees were always clearly and to the point.
This course did a wonderful job of walking through some complex and broad topics. I've done other AI learning with the same ideas, and I felt that this was present very well. It's also been a long time since I was actually inspired by a course - not just in terms of getting excited about playing with the tech and continuing to explore the subject are - but also in terms of taking a moment to examine the breadth of the impact of this learning. I'm not sure if that's what the instructors were going for, but I absolutely found this course to be that, and I'm very grateful that it was made and even prouder to work for the company that made it. Thank you!
The course does an excellent job touching on the concept of each major ideas within AI. The course is suitable for people of all backgrounds (including non-programmers) and business leaders to get a grasp of the latest technology. The course should be built upon in the same specialization with more in-depth explanation of the same concepts using mathematical formulas and/or programming languages rather than by the application of AI using IBM Watsons, which is viewed irrelevant for me as a business person who does not do direct business with IBM.
I learned so much on this AI course, which entailed many hours of reading and learning, with useful videos to help make this more interesting.   The questions asked throughout each section and topic area. helped to consolidate key points. The hands on IBM Watson experience was enjoyable,  facilitating a lab experience.  I have been asked if I would recommend this course and I can honestly say, I have already recommended it to several people.  Earning a Certificate  also helps to motivate you to advance to the next stage.
I enjoyed taking this course and I think that it was an excellent introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). This course had a very well-organized structure and provided clear and concise overviews of relevant topics and application areas of AI, along with interesting hands-on labs, quizzes, and useful readings to review and expand upon what the student has learned. Overall, I think that the instructor and contributors to the course did a great job in making learning about AI approachable and interesting.
I really enjoyed the course. It was interactive and practical. I now understand the real meaning of AI. I was really unaware of the Ethics and Bias part of AI which I learnt in the course.Instructors were amazing. Specially to see Tanmay at the age of 15 with so much of passion he talks about AI. It really motivates me more and more.Course content was excellent. I have a clear understanding of AI definition, concepts, ethics and bias, its impact on the different areas.Thank you to all instructors.
This was an excellent course for starters in AI which gives a complete overview of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning technologies and how it is changing the way the world works and lives. Also, gives a clear understanding of what it would take to pursue a career in AI. The content looks curated and is able to explain some of the very complex topics in an intuitive and easy to understand manner. Thanks and hope we see more such courses from you in future!
I honestly started this course with some minor skepticism that i would even be interested in the subject matter but i knew where my industry is going, so i figured that i may as well learn about AI. I am blown away at how interested i became as i learned more about each concept. This intro course has definitely pushed me to finish the entire specialization and possibly look into others. Very well put together and it was not boring at all.
Being new to the field of AI. This course provided a solid start of the concepts needed to begin delving into this space. I am excited to be a part of this AI journey and preparing myself for this inevitable technology that will impact our existence in many positive ways. I will definitely continue to do the other courses in the specialization. Thanks Coursera and IBM for making this training available.Corey D.
Very well conducted. It certainly clarifies all the basics of AI as will be very useful in taking decisions for business, as in my case. I particularly appreciate opportunity provided to work on IMB Watson and option to do so in a deeper way if necessary. However, will appreciate if similar services provided by others could also be identified - just for reference and knowledge. Congratulations and many thanks.
I'm a newbie. I have keen desire to know what AI works. After completing the course I have got my answer. In fact now I can say confidently how it works as well. Thanks IBM Developer Network and Rav Ahuja for giving me the access to the course. And, specially thanks for providing me the opportunity to complete the course with you kind financial aid. I wish one day you will be on the first on pioneer list.
This course runs in basic level to medium at some point. It first introduces you to what is AI then what are its benefits and then its key terms. This is a good course who wants to know get introduced to AI.It also includes hands on session with the help of Watson. These are some of good implementation and are very exciting. And in between interviews of professional motivate us to be one like them.
This was an excellent introductory course! Very insightful and informative without being overwhelmingly complicated or technical. Finishing this course has energized me to continue to follow through on the next ones and complete the Data Science specialization. Thank you to the teachers, assistants, technical team, and the Coursera staff for this amazing learning opportunity. You all rock!!
A big thank you to IBM and Mr. Rav Ahuja. Even as a Computer Science student, who has had a keen interest in AI since 2017, there was so much I got to learn from here. The course content is streamlined, smoothly transitioned, and very well communicated. It does, indeed teach you everything from the basics and clears out so many concepts that you didn't even know you had wrong. Wonderful!
Perhaps one of the best courses by IBM which is going to introduce you to the field of AI,Machine Learning and Deep Learning and also helps a person in order to get initial knowledge about the various terminologies in the field. The course was also consisting of a number of use-cases and various other examples of IBM Watson which provided you with one of the best examples for this field.
Its an excellent course for beginners. The course content is well organized for beginners to understand various aspects of Artificial Intelligence. The assignment questions are well structured. IBM Watson lab experiment was Interesting. If you are looking for more detailed understanding of AI or Machine Learning I feel you can check the other courses in this series.
It was an excellent course, making the learner understand what AI and ML are. Many people have the fear that AI and ML are something that cannot be understood by a common man. This course will overcome that fear. I thank IBM and Team for giving me this opportunity to have a hands on experience on AI and ML.  I wish all success to the IBM Team in its endeavors.
Great introductory AI course for both beginners and person like myself that knows some bits about AI and its underlying maths and mechanisms. Though this introductory course is mainly videos, readings, and clicky-clicky model demos without coding, it is still interesting and it may trigger some ideas hide inside yourself. Generally a big thumb for beginners!
The class was very useful in understanding the basics of AI (mostly a refresher from my graduate school days). The content was the right amount and the quizzes helped to revise the topics. The articles that are hyperlinked seemed too distracting to navigate back to the home page after reading. Overall, this was a good class and would recommend it to my team.
The course is a simple introduction to AI, different forms of AI, general classifications and algorithms. This course also gives an insight into the ethical and human aspect into AI. Through the interview of many AI experts this course introduce the scope and opportunities in the area of AI. A good course for all who are looking for an introduction to  AI
Good Day

I successfully completed this my course . The introduction of artificial intelligence course is vey interesting and the assignments are very challenging. In this course you have final assessment part two do that properly first in this read the content properly once and twice finally, I got certificate for completion of my course from IBM
In this course I learned a new concept of computer science. A very good starting 
point to explore and learn more about this fascinating world. In the session everyone elaborate lots of information and mostly I Like tanmay's advice on Career with Artificial Intelligence. Its really great to learn AI and its applications.
This course is very instructive and useful for the newcomers to the ocean of Artificial Intelligence. It will widen your horizons to build fundamentals of this fascinating field and will encourage you to go further in deep. I strongly suggest for those who are planning to start and specialize in AI. Good luck, guys!
A great course for beginners. This course covers a wide range of concepts related to AI and its implications for the future. It also has hands-on training explaining how different ML algorithms work.
