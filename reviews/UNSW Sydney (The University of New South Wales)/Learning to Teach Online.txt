This course is quite boring and I have not felt it has been really useful.
why can't I un-enroll this course, I tried clicking un-enroll many many times, help please!
This has just been a long and rambling series of telling us to use technology because it's important to ensure the kids can cope with the digital age and to caution us that while doing so, we should meet the needs of learners and to align with learning objectives rather than use it based on personal whim and fancy. Other than flipped classroom (which is passe already), where are the pedagogical approaches that will actually help with learning? Instead we get very non-specific advice like "you have to plan ahead and think about how to make the tool align". I get that there are so many subjects that it's hard to find accessible case studies on specific subjects for a general teaching audience, but it really is very silly to give us examples like using flikr to enhance one's photography class. On the SAMR evaluative model (which this course ought to talk about but does not), this is clearly at the lowest level! What I would like to see is the substantial research and more academic rigour. Also, it's really ironic that around half the links this course uses are broken! That is really not making the e-learning case.
The course is very poorly designed to be taught online. Most of the recommendations they make, they, the builders of the course do not carry them out. Why, if they are experts in online tools for education, they do not put them into practice and teach us how to use them. The course is limited to an immeasurable amount of boring and repetitive videos and some assignments without further use of the cyber tools.
After Completing and submitting all the self assessments and the graded assignments, still its shows that the self-assessments have not been submitted and the final grade was just given as 58.7%TOTALLY UNPLEASING
Not very satisfied with the course here.It looks like a collection of interviews from various people who have found success in teaching online.I understand that hearing their opinion helps, but it did not feel like a complete course
The class seems to be mostly a central hub for internet links related to online teaching.  There were a few videos by the instructors giving introductions to the topics but not teaching the topics.  Also some videos of other teachers' experiences.  However, there was little material directly in the class about online teaching.  The course format was multiple self-assessments of how comfortable you feel in your pre-existing knowledge about the various topics and then based on how you marked the self-assessment, the software would spit out a huge list of external links to material on the topic.  I estimate over 300 links sent to me from the course software.  I don't mind a few external references, but I expected the course to cover the material, not act one massive hyperlink doc.  Also, the two assignments were a bit vague and graded only by fellow students.  So my "grade" and feedback were not from the course instructors who have the knowledge, but opinions by a few students who happen to be taking the MOOC the same time I was.  I prefer to get feedback from the instructors--that is why I am taking the course.  Also, the LMS would hang after the self-assessment/list of links portions.  And when I would reset, I would lose credit for watching the videos.  My completion record never did update to show that I watched the required videos.  This entire course could be replaced by just sending the complete list of links to the students and skipping everything else.
Many words, very little specific details and recommendations
I did not receive the certificate and did not get the chance to get review report on my assignments. Although I attended this course on my University platform
Inspired me to try a flipped classroom. Provoked me to research several educational technologies. Provided me with a strong foundation for implementing technology in the classroom. Very beneficial, overall. However, many broken links. Some links led to subpar resources. I found some questions poorly worded, leaving them open to more than one answer - but not the one they wanted! Some activity feedback / scores didn't make sense to me. Would be nice to see peer reviews of my submitted work. Tech help was fast and efficient, though.
Very interesting subject but for a course on e-learning the methods are quite modest and a bit obsolete. There is a lot of repetitive tasks and lectures following the same pattern. Also a lot of hyperlinks to recommended readings don't work. I've taken a few more appealing courses here already
The fundamentals taught in this course were helpful, but the learning resources used were out-of-date with some even being unavailable. I would be interested in an updated version of this course.
Please try to give a live demo on use on different technology mentioned in modules as done in case study
I found that many of the links for the recommended readings were not valid. There was no interactions with the teachers other than the small  prerecorded videos at the beginning of each module.
Run of the mill, more of the same, letÂ´s full the course with things and interviews. I am not saying it was not well made - it is just the generic things that I would full a course if the supervisor mandated me to do a course like that.For teachers who are drowning I imagine it will be helpful, but for the most experienced will be just selecting some new websites/tools and one or other sparse idea
The only downside to the course is reviewing peer work and this is because you see how little some have put into it. I found the lack of effort by some peers rather disappointing. However, the course content is great for new knowledge and ideas.
Good Course, well paced, a bit too focused on Academic Institutions
I found this course quite useful, although I would add more practice, since that is the best way that to me works to make sure that I have truly and effectively acquired the knowledge and tools offered by the course.
Everything is so generic, so abstract and it is not concise at all
This class was listed as being for beginners. I don't agree with that. It assumed too much prior knowledge and was way over my head! I was hoping to get some  instruction in actually using online tools to create classes. This was more propaganda for why online instruction is so good. I was kind of disappointed.
I want to give this course a full 5-star review but I can't.  I am overwhelmed by the amazing, and amazing amount of resources.  I am extremely happy about that.  I felt the course was well-organized and easy to follow.  However, I have two major problems with the course.  Firstly, if my VPN was down (as it was for a friend), we couldnt' see the videos as they are hosted on YouTube and people living behind the Great Firewall of China cannot access YouTube. Please host them in a place that all, or at least more, people can access them.  Secondly, so many of the links for recommended, further, etc readings were not working.  For one module, all five of the links were dead.  In that case, I feel like the self-evaluation's time and my money were wasted.  I am a university teacher, too, and this is term time.  Please don't waste my time with dead links.   On a separate note, videos in Modele 8, I believe, talked about the appropriateness and ability to change materials within the course during the course.  I was on the MOOC on Friday and thought I'd finished all the components except my final assignment submission.  Waking Saturday to find self-evaluations and other readings pop up that had not been there the previous day infuriated me and wasted the rest of the day.  As far as I could see, there'd been no notice of it being down, being mainanenced, or being uploaded   Overall, I enjoyed the course and will be recommending it.  Conversely, you need to sort out those issues. PS The teaching assistant seemed lovely.
Good lecturers, clear delivery, and lots of great reading materials. What I really like about this course is that it is so well organised, using their own protocols, which are documented and shared with the student, that following the course gives you some idea of what a good online course should look like.The forums are moderated, but not by the teachers of the course, which creates a slight disconnect. However, posted comments are read and replied to, which is good.Some of the materials feel dated for the topic (as far back as articles about wikis and blogging published in 2009!). This could be improved.Another thing I liked a lot was that the assignments were really challenging (not multiple choice exams) and you are rewarded for using sources presented to you during the course in your assignments. Peer feedback system works quite well.
There is nothing revolutionary in this course about teaching online, however, I do believe that it teaches the fundamentals well. If you are new to online teaching or perhaps would like to tune up your skills and make sure that what you are doing is best practice then this course is for you.
Please update with some current Platforms in use at academia.
Overall, I learned a lot about this course. I was able to reassess my strengths and weakness in conduct lessons online. The only thing that I didn't liked about the course is that some students who conduct the peer review don't seem to read the submitted content well. I hated when somebody gave me a score of 0 and 2 when I clearly stated facts and included resources and my personal experience to support my output. It was quite disappointing that these students are not doing peer review in a professional way. I hope that you would be able to look into this because it was so unfair on my part to have a very low score from them.
This course is nicely designed, however, it's very exhaustive when it comes to the reading material. The high amount of reading material can prove to be negative for student engagement and motivation. Despite that, I learned multiple open-source online tools and technologies, for example, Stile, Flickr, Pinterest, etc along with the open-source websites for educational material like MIT open courseware, that not just support but elevate the online teaching-learning for the students as well as the teachers. Overall I learned a lot through this course. Thanks for floating this one.
Very good course with nicely organized activities and assessments. Short video segments and questions made it easy to budget my time.  Helped me to think about key concepts of designing an online component for a blended course. Final assessment required me to outline my new course activity, which was very helpful for my actual job.  Enormous number of outside links to reference sources was almost overwhelming (too many to follow up on); few broken links to defunct or closed websites.
I found this course very uesful as introduction to do an online module. I have missed a simple guidance on how the course flow would be and to have me made more conscious of the deadlines that I found out myself in a very late stage. This course is focussed for teachers. I am a sales person and was therefore not the best choice for me as too oriented on teachers which makes sense. Thank you. Will book another course for sure.
The course would be an effective way to introduce yourself to online learning and teaching. As someone who has taught online before, I learned as much (and maybe even more) by how the course was delivered than by the actual content. The assignments were effective ways to reflect upon your learning and ideas about online teaching. The peer feedback was widely varied, but there were a few good suggestions. Thank you for sharing this MOOC to the broader community, particularly when everyone finds themselves needing to teach online.
Very good course to interact with class students online
Very well supported although could be least extensive
It's one of the inspirational course I had attend.
I couldn't find much motivation for this course.
It was very time intensive. A lot of reading.
The course was intense but very informative.
Great Exposure....Learned a new platform...
A great introduction for online learning
Good but not general enough to suit all
Peer assessments need to be moderated.
it was great and really insightful.
Good course learned a lot from it
Have learned  a lot ,wonderful
a very good lesson ....
Its very informative
informativecourse
It was indeed great learning by enrolling in this course. Almost every module/video, experts, were worth listening. However, I've got a humble piece of suggestion for the course instructors. We'have been glued to screen listening to you folks and being very attentive to internalise the subject matter. In the process, it becomes very monotonous to keep doing so. Having just two self-check activities or exercises for a 5-week long course, are not sufficient enough to hold the audience back. Also when two of the instructors keep sitting through close to 100 videos, it becomes disengaging for the viewers. Had they delivered some sessions standing and using their backdrop to impart knowledge, would have been more engaging for the participants. One more thing that can be embedded in the videos itself, is "quick quizzes on-screen" wherein the participant answers the question and clicks to see the right answer and the presenter continues the discussion.All in all, very good learning for me to start teaching online... Bingo!
It would have been a 5-star course five years ago. My only major critique is that it is a bit outdated simply because of how fast technology evolves: It seems the course was created circa 2012, and maybe even before. This also led to issues with some of the links being broken in suggested resources, which is annoying, especially if you're someone who is actually taking the time to wade through the mountain of "recommended" resources. I did this as professional development as a college writing instructor at the direction of my institution, and I'd say it was a great introduction to teaching online, especially when it comes to student engagement and motivation, and instructor presence. I was able to use the assignments to start making a rough outline of online courses I'll be teaching in the fall. I'm still not a believer in MOOCs, but this worked fine for me for what it was.
Good course overall. Definitely value for money. I found the videos with close caption very useful. A few points, please review the material regularly as some of the sites were removed. It could be quite frustrating when click on a few links and they are not available anymore. I would also review the word count on the assignments. I spent more time editing the work to fit the word-count than I did on writing it. Can you really get the essence in 200 words?  Some of the reading was excessive though. I also felt that some of the questions in the self-development exercises questionable in terms of the response. Finally, you should really have a reference list in the module summary pdf files so we can use this as a basis for further research. Apart from that, I hope I can implement what I have learned at work. Thank you...
This course was geared more toward the educator who is starting to introduce online and e-learning technologies into their teaching practice. As a future elearning course developer I found this course to provide me with a good foundation for online learning. I felt that UNSW did a great job with their Case Study interviews in various fields of study and how educators use different technologies for different objectives. I also thought that the recommended reading / viewing references based on the ungraded personal assessments were very helpful. I saved them all and anticipate having to refer to them in the future.  I highly recommend this course if this matches what you need for your career. Thank you UNSW team for all your great work!!
The course is rich with resources and provides an array of strategies for online and blended learning. The assignments helped me reflect on my existing practices and helped me achieve a new perspective in planning activities, resources and assessments. I explored a lot of tools online which I would have probably not done otherwise. However, The course is more relevant for higher education especially University education and found less resources and strategies for K-12, especially Primary school. It would have been nice if case studies around K-12 was a lot more, would have been useful for me to put it in practice.
Good basic course for teaching online, with some interesting ideas. Videos are well thought out with relevant information, real examples provide excellent content to verify how to implement some ideas into educational settings. Much of the content does seem more targeted to higher education which doesn't fully apply to me as a Secondary School teacher, however there is overlap and I have learnt great ideas of how to plan, assess and evaluate online learning. Overall I am impressed and glad to have completed this course.My only suggestion for improvement would be to fix the dead links in the suggested resources.
The teachers of this course were excellent collaborators.  I found the Question and Answer section quite helpful.  The course was definitely overwhelming to me at first, having never had computer classes in my education through my masters degree.  However, the way the course was presented allowed me to move forward and persevere.  I found the vocabulary used in describing the assignments new to me.  Therefore, I felt greatly challenged.  However, when I was able to successfully pass each assignment and reflect on peer reviews I felt a great sense of accomplishment.
The content is relevant and very well founded. The videos are quite useful and allow to go deeper into topics and definitions. However, although some of the material was optional, everything had to be reviewed in order to pass the course and obtain the certificate. For example, I think it would be useful to give a percentage to the participation in the forums, to encourage students to give elaborated answers and not just participate so that the forum activity would appear as completed.
I did like the MOOc. Sometimes the amount of information and documents to read were overwhealming. Too much and not allways clear what was more important aÂ¡or useful. I will have to continue reviewing many documents. I was doing this MOOC at the same time that I was redigning my course that has to begin in two weeks. For this reason I did not always had the time to read all the suggested recomended documents. Thank you
It was really interesting to join such a contemporary course. I like the quality of the videos share though the optional ones needed some upgrading. I also liked the personalized element where the activities lead to specified elements. I hope to see a more practical course where some of the technologies addressed can be put into practice and then linked to a pedagogical framework.
This course is great for first time to experienced online instructors. There is something new for everyone. The course covers everything from the beginning to end of the course to assessments. The most beneficial part was the course gave specific articles and tools based on what type of classes your are teaching whether its ESL or elementary or university.
Great course to help someone begin the considerations for an online course. There's no one-size fits all solution, and this course helps teachers navigate options and plan accordingly. The linked resources are very helpful, but many are starting to feel out of date. A slight update to course content and linked resources would benefit students greatly!
Overall it was an informative course and I learnt a lot of new techniques and ideas that will help me to enhance my teaching and learning experience. I will also be more confident now to integrate technology in my lessons. Just a suggestion that you should recheck some of the resources shared in reading section as they were not accessible.
This was a valuable course for teachers who commence their journey in online teaching. The course could have included a demonstration of an online teaching class using digital tools. This would have helped in visualizing and virtually experiencing the engagement in this novel mode.Thanks for curating and delivering a wonderful experience!
I found the course to be very interesting.  I am not a very techno-savvy person and the  course really enhanced my knowledge about the resources available out there. Both the instructors (Negin and Simon) did a real good job with the design and the delivery.  Thanks a lot to the entire team which strived towards putting this course up.
Great option to enrich our online teaching practices in terms of contents and assignments: it provides a good combination of visual and written resources as well as project-based learning. Also integrates different kinds of online teaching methodology along the course development
This was a great course in preparing me for the unknown 2020-21 school year, with us being remote most likely.  There were links that did not work and would like to see some new articles concerning online teaching models.  Thank you for this opportunity to grow as an educator.
This course helped me get an overview of all the things we need to consider for online teaching to work as a whole. It is a course that gives you a perspective of how you are using technology in the classroom and how small activities correlate to your global learning goals.
It was a very thorough course. Very well done for 2010 or whenever it was done. But that is the downside: there were quite a bunch of links with 404. I think in the current times it would be much easier than back then when the course was created to track the error-links.
Enjoyed the wealth of information, numerous short videos, online resources and practical assignments. While I do not work in an educational institution, I feel more equipped now to develop, facilitate and evaluation online webinars at my not-for-profit agency.
The course is very nicely designed and introduces the learner about the principles behind online teaching. It would be much better if the course gives more overview about the different tools that are used in online teaching and how to use them effectively.
Great course lot of new things and very helpful for the freshers who's just thinking to join in educational system also for the people who's already in the field of education there's no end for learning and teaching and this course can be the Good one
This is a good course for the topic however it assumes that you are already teaching or have taught.It is designed to reinforce teaching methods and discusses the options of moving education online.Lessons are well presented with ample referencing.
Although the content in the videos wasn't rocket science, the wealth of external literature, blogs, videos, and research results, enriched my understanding of the importance of a proper training setup and teaching method for online training.
Hi! This was a useful course. It provided a lot of information and even recommended readings. The assignments are also very good. However, I would like the videos to be more than the lecturers speaking. Overall, it is very good.
This course helped me develop my thinking and research skills. I have been able to acquire more knowledge on online teaching and learning and I am proud to be able to put this in use in my everyday life as a K-12 facilitator.
I found this course very useful in learning many things to teach courses online. This will, no doubt, help me a lot in designing and teaching courses online during the pandemic scenario of COVID 19 and even afterwards.
It was really a good course which gave me overview of all the open tools and technology used for online teaching. It also upgraded my educational knowledge and skills which will help me throughout my teaching journey.
I really enjoyed being a part of this course.. Suggestion for next run is include more global tools. More tools were restricted to either higher education or something that needs to be purchased by the organisation.
Very good for starting to look into online teaching, It also serves as reinforcement of crucial pedagogical elements such as curriculum alignment. formative assessment and student's engagement and motivation.
Very good for beginners!  I hope the course provider can also assign raters for the submitted output to provide balance with the peer review.  Overall, I learned a lot and will recommend this to my friends.
This was quite interactive and had a lot of good resources, curated to what you wanted to gain.  My biggest issue, however, is some of the resources are either slghtly dated or no longer available.
This was a great learning experience. My only suggestion is that a lot of links shared for resources didnt open it was page not found. I would have loved to take a look at those as well.
I really appreciate going through this course. Eventhough I have been teaching online but there are lot of knowledge skills and reasoning I developed when I am exposed to this course.Q
My expectations were different from the reality of this course, nevertheless the tools I learned will be of much help in developing and improving the finance courses I teach.
I liked the course as it provided some insights of how to conduct online teaching, various online platforms/applications, and many other facets to teach online successfully.
A very well explained and thoughtfully designed course that gives one a basic idea and the avenues of online teaching. Each of the module is simple and clearly explained.
I thoroughly enjoyed the course as it helped put a lot of learning (that I have had on the job) in proper perspective. I specifically enjoyed the off platform activities.
This is an excellent course, many thanks for everyone who helped to produce it! But it is necessary to update some contents. I hope there will be a second version soon!
For a beginner like me who is new to online teaching, the contents were very useful and it was very practical. The flow of the contents were interesting. thanks a lot.
it is a good course, it introduced me with a lot of open internet sources that I can use to enhance my pedagogical strategies/approach. thank you coursera.org
Some great material, and really valuable insights to the skill of teaching on line.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in on line teaching.
There is a lot of material to cover, not all of it applies to me. But it is a very interesting topic and the personalized resources are very useful.
The course is outstanding in explaining the materials and have significant resources. the only issue is few of them are outdated but it's okay. â¥
Good overview of teaching online . One gets an idea of things to be considered before, during and after the implementation  of an online course.
Pretty intense but detailed course. Supply of recommended resources commendable. The videos were simply, useful and easy to follow. Great job!
Its helpful in understanding how online teaching learning should be designed to use technology aligning it with pedagogy and course outcomes
Explores a lot of new technology while keeping pedagogy in mind. A few links and reading resources are unavailable. Kindly update the list.
Each module was well designed , informative and quite relevant with numerous good examples. Thank you for the learning opportunity
The course was interesting and the Case study was quite informative part on how the technology is actually used by real teachers.
It is a great primer for online teaching experience, and broadens your mind to many possibilities and concerns of the trasition.
If you are interested in developing Your on teaching into new technology and prepare for the future this is a course for You.
This course was a very educative and informative  for me to work in this pandemic situation which was very helpful indeed.
I highly recommend this course, to learn the basics about teaching online, but I would like more practice activities.
It was a very well developed course with lots of case studies. It really helped me gain skills I need as a teacher
Not that applicable to preschool teachers but full of information about online teaching and learning! :)
I m very happy from this course .It is an excellent way to get education. It my first online course
It was an amazing course, but I would recommend some changes related to the peers assessment
It was a wonderful experience. Each and every activity and assessment are well connected.
Its a great place where you can get more great tools for delivering your online classes.
Good course for online teaching/teachers. Explores several key areas online teaching.
Excellent design and flow of the course. Was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
I appreciated the short modules and flexibility of time to complete the course.
Overall very informative and to the point course for teachers.One must adopt it
Thank you Coursera and UNSW for an engaging and satisfying learning experience.
Nice presentation , case studies were relevant, reference material are helpful
Congratulations to the instructors and UNSW. Very useful for online teaching.
I could learn and gain the required knowledge to teach online effectively
The course taught me many things which will help me in my Online Classes.
A great course for beginners in the field of teaching and education.
I have learned many online tools and their usage. Very very Useful.
Very good course useful for teachers in today's situations ðð
Very useful information and resourceful for on-line teaching.
I anticipated that the course would have been more hands-on.
very nice videos has provided i have learn lots of thinks
Great help for teachers that are new to online teaching.
This course very helpful for further study and job.
I think the concepts and the information presented, plus the peer evaluation process and the wealth of resources make this course a great overview for anyone teaching online for the first time, especially those of us forced into Distance Learning. I am taking away a lot of good conceptual ideas, plus many bookmarked websites and pdfs. At the same time, some of the course materials, especially when referring to specific technologies, is outdated. More than a few links to the online resources are broken or absent, and should be checked and replaced as needed. Overall, thank you for a 4 out of 5 star experience!
I really enjoyed and benefitted from the course. It touched on all key components that we are currently experiencing as teachers since the pandemic started.The only  suggestion I have is that the University should also be involved in evaluating the assignments that are graded. I feel, from my experience, that the people that did evaluate were not necessarily well experienced or expert enough in doing so.All in all, I will recommend this course to my teacher friends for sure.Thank you
THIS Course gives you a great insight to teaching online , Most of us started recently due to the  Covid 19 situation. great resources. and you will learn a ton especially from the assignment and the community .Hope to attend next level course  since teaching  online is not an option any more, it is the new reality . Thanks a lot for the journey  :)
A very timely and relevant course at the time most higher-education institutions have been essentially forced to take the digital leap as a reaction to the Covid-19 crisis. Whilst it touches on all the areas relevant in this new normal, it might be worthwhile updating some of the content towards the online only reality.
+ Videos = short but informative+ Self-evaluations = tailored to individual teaching categories (K-12, ESL, etc)+ Resources = many worthwhile articles to read, consult and download.+ Projects = challenging and well explained_ Discussion forums - not so helpful
Peer review has to be better managed. My work was peer reviewed by colleagues within the same institution to  which we have a mutual dislike. This personal rift could have affected  my grading outcome.
It was a nice learning experience. I suggest to give more room (more flexible schedule) to submit tasks and reports. Overall was good.
The course obviously met my desire for a skills upgrade. I can now approach online teaching methodically with confidence. Excited.
Excellent guidance and online ungraded activity also helps in improving the concept of online teaching learning activity
It's a great course with not only fundamental knowledge about online teaching but also great case studies.
I really appreciate the list of resources as well as the Q & A which was good feedback.
A good course for beginners to start online teaching.Thanks to authors
I learnt a lot fo new tools and how to use them for online teaching
it gets a bit repetitive for someone already teaching online.
how you benefited from the course and the duration it took.
Very well planned. Provided fruitful information.
It's well designed course
Very help ful all the way
It is very good course
It's really awesome
Thanks to the course teachers and others associated with designing such a wonderful learning experience. Appreciate each one of your contributions is peer learning and evaluation. Best wishes
Well organised and very useful course for online teaching beginners. One very useful feature is that timelines can be reset which allows for assignments to be submitted later if necessary.
A wonderful experience and a handy course. The lecturers are great with a very nice way on interacting. Thank you for all your cooperation. Hope to see more of you in future. Thank you once again.
This course was excellent, the amount of information and tools they provide us are wonderful. The Simon and Negin,  Course Instructors show great knowledge and professionalism. Thanks for everything.
Very good course that has given an overview of using and implementing web tools appropriately to optimize students' performance in their academic experience leading to become an independent learner.
This course exceeded my expectations!  It is extremely  well-planned with engaging materials. What impressed me the most about this course is the quality of the videos, the interesting case studies which includes practical tips on how to plan an online course. The timely support and feedback offered by tutors on the online forums has been great. I could really feel a tutor presence during the 5 weeks! Inclusion of  specifically tailored suggested readings have made this course  truly innovative. I think other online courses could learn a lot from this MOOC. I would recommend taking this course if you have time on your hands. It's super intensive with lots of reading involved. You'll probably need to set aside  6-8 hours/week rather than the suggested 3-4 hours/week if you want to fully benefit from the course. It's challenging yet very rewarding!
This course provides me the information about various online tools, strategies and planning for the best techniques for online courses. I will make the use of this valuable information in my work.
A great introductory course to the world of online teaching and learning. I am grateful to have undergone this course, especially considering the current circumstances. Highly recommended.
I'm so glad I enrolled in this course.   It was a wonderful experience. This course provided me with a glimpse into the world of online teaching, the resources involved in its teaching, the institutional and open access technology that is required for it, and the learning curve that is required by both teacher and learner to make it work. This course has both depth and breadth and its up to the learner to either skim the surface or plunge into it depending on your time availability and pace. The instructors and moderators were most helpful in the discussion forums. It does seem very dense, however, for a 4 week course, but the learner can keep going back to the resources that are mailed to the learner after the self-assessment tests. I highly recommend this course, and would like to enrol in it again at some point.
The topics discussed in this course is very helpful and very practical. Personally, it makes me think more about what a great teacher should do in order to prepare our teachings. Thank you, UNSW.
A course that really made me think - however, could some marking be done by the university? as sometimes my feedback from other people on the course was only one word.
A really interesting course for someone who is already teaching and wants to spice up the classroom or for someone who has absolutely no knowledge on online teaching.
The course teaches a lot on the online learning tools, which can be effectively used in day to day teaching. Teaching can be made simple and effective using online tools.Thank you for the course.
Well conceived and executed course. No hesitation in recommending it for those who wish to get a comprehensive understanding of online teaching!
The resources and linked articles for the course were of a very high quality - and seemed to have good currency still too - which is great this is not just an online MOOC that has been set up and left to run out of its usefulness, it was still current and helpful.  The information about the loading of the assignments is a little clunky - perhaps it could be repeated in the second assignment information as well as the first assignment information, i had forgotten the steps when it came time to submit the assignment and ended up submitting late because I ran out of time to search and find the steps again - they were not easily (re)located.  I would recommend this course as suitable for a beginner with some area of 'stretch' into further details for a slightly more experienced online learning environment user, many thanks.
I am a digital immigrant. It was harder for me to take this course but, I am very pleased because I learned new skills in the field of technology. For me, it was not easy to talk about online teaching because this is not practiced in my school. By examining the work of colleagues from other countries I saw how useful online teaching is. Gee Ghong Ling is very attentive and responds promptly to messages. Congratulations!  Thank you Professor Simon McIntyre and Dr. Negin Mirriahi!
This was an incredible online course that taught me a lot about online teaching.  The resources for the course was vast, the instructors were extremely professional and experienced and provided great insights and knowledge into the curriculum.  The self-assessments throughout the course were extremely valuable and the resources page paid dividends and provided a wealth of knowledge.  I highly recommended this course to my government agency.  I took the techniques that I have learned and successfully applied them to my curriculum. I was strictly an in classroom-type teaching person but after completion of this superb course, I changed a few of my courses to blended learning, as well as other courses that I made to work online.  I am ready to use the numerous online approaches platforms and modalities I learned from this course.  Highly recommend 5 stars!!
I am loving this course! Never did I take an online course with this amount of support and extra reading to help me cope with the lack of face-to-face moments with a teacher. The reading suggestions so far are spot on and I already feel more comfortable with the course itself. They even guide us on how to evaluate better an online course. Thank you so much for this opportunity and for creating this for us teachers!
The Course has been structured exceptionally well and helped a senior teacher like I to boot up online teaching! The given resources are excellent and this course itself a model to desing, deploy and to motivate learners by way of videos quizzes! Hats off to the creators and presentors and all the co-participants in teaching this!
I am extremely Grateful to the creators of the course and the mentors for making learning holistic and enjoyable, besides exposing me to the magnitude of possibilities in facilitating teaching and learning in an acceptable and joyous manner. Got excellent insight into the galaxy of teaching-learning methods ans media available.
Fantastic course! It is really rich and provides tons of content. The teachers explain the material very clearly. I definitely learned a lot due to this course.The only minor downside is that some links to the resources in this course are no longer available (the websites are too old, the webpages do not exist anymore, etc.)
It was my first MOOC and I have to say that I really liked the experience because of how they have structured the course and for the amount of generic and personalized material that they offer you. If you are looking for a course that will help you solve the shortcomings of your online teaching, THIS IS YOUR COURSE.
It's thorough. It assesses where we are in terms of online teaching and gives us a multitude of resources to help us journey through this new and complicated process. The videos presented are precise and the quizzes and case scenarios given are very practical. I love this course and I'd go over it again and again!
This course is very well structured with very useful contents and resources. I'm really thankful for having this great learning experience. I strongly recommend this course to all teachers and pedagogues in all levels.
This course has taught me the fundamentals of designing an online class. It has been so helpful for me to take the theory from the course and use it in a practical manner in my job as Academic coach. Thank you
Big thanks to Simon and Negin ,the way that they designed the course was one of the best example of using technology for online teaching and get the best outcome of the class  .
Great online module! Recommended to everyone who wants to teach online.
It is well planned, organized, clearly stated course expectations and course requirements. Course materials, videos, activities and resources are relevant and updated. Course faculty members are knowledgeable, experts and updated. I feel honoured to part of this course as I have learnt a lot and being able to move into digital literary and online teaching
A very helpful course that provides the basics for any teacher trying to understand the different elements involved in teaching online and in teaching in a blended situation. LOVE the Case Studies and I am truly grateful for all the references provided because they really make you better understand what are the core issues when teaching online. Thank you.
This is a fascinating course, from start to finish. It takes the participant on an increasingly interesting journey in the aspect of strategies and methodologies for teaching through technology. I have learned a universe of motivating techniques to achieve a more successful class and to get students interested and engaged in the work of learning online.
I took this course because due to Covid 19, many schools are moving at least a portion of the learning online and I wanted to be equipped to handle it. This course provided me with a very thorough overview of understanding the why and how to begin online teaching and has excited me to look deeper into some of the topics introduced by the course.
I've been teaching online for decades and this has given me such enlightenment on how to fully utilise the power of the internet when it comes to online activities. Now I'm pursuing a career in curriculum development, this course has given me deep insights on how to make online activities engaging, enriching and of course educational.
I have learned a lot from just a short period of time. I have had my own reservations regarding the effectivity of on-line learning but this course opened my mind to a whole bigger world of learning dissemination . the professors were outstanding! I wish there would be a part two! I highly recommend this course! It's life changing!
A very well organized course, the instructors show profound knowledge of the subjects, the array of provided contents such as websites, books, articles, videos etc is incredible, and for me, who is at the beginning of a carrer as online teacher, they are like treasure. Finally, both UNSW and Coursera have my sincere thankfulness.

Coursera is very good for all the teacher those who are engaging in online teaching class. It provides to learn various tools for online classes.

The design of the course, its content and the assessments are very well aligned and  give you a feel of profound learning taking place. I would recommend any teacher to enroll in this course. You will love it. The resources available as course materials and optional ones are well-researched selections.
Amazing course! It was well made. This is the first extensive course that I finished. When I got a low score during my 1st assignment, it pushed me to do better. The peer feedback helped me realize the things I need to work on and made me open my eyes to ideas shared by fellow colleagues in the course.
This course really enabled me to improve my teaching skills for online teaching. It taught me how to develop, align,  deliver and assess online components into a blended course.  The best part of the course is that it discusses how to engage, motivate and drive student to get their best for the course.
Thank you Coursera. I have learnt that knowledge created by learners is more powerful than information given to them so share respectfully, suspend judgement, keep an open mind, have courage to ask questions and participate actively with new online technologies to gain wisdom for the greatest results.
This course was  excellent and has given me an overview of using technology appropriately to enhance my teaching skills. What I liked  is the quality of videos and well-spaced assignments.The instructions were very clear. Thank you Dr. Negin and Prof. Simon for your wonderful sessions . Best wishhes!

Great option to enrich our online teaching practices in terms of contents and assignments: it provides a good combination of visual and written resources as well as project-based learning. Also integrates different kinds of online teaching methodology along the course development.
If a person takes the time to read all of the attached pdfs and website you can get quite a detailed knowledge of this topic.  The course did a very good job of mirroring the principles that it taught.

The platform is intuitive and flexible as it makes suggestions of content to fit your particular needs and background. I want to thank UNSW for creating these learning resources and making them available to many of us.
Thank you.  I learned so much from this MOOC.Unfortunately, for both assignments I had a peer rater who gave me a zero all throughout (despite getting a high evaluation from the other two).  This was something I did not learn from.  I wish I received constructive reviews so I can really improve.
Excellent course. The best part about it was that there was so much material available to learn about various aspects of teaching online, so there was always opportunities to get a deeper understanding of things. Self-directed, self-paced, and well-organized. I really enjoyed taking this course.

This is a well-structured course and has excellent resources, is well-paced and possibly the number 1 course i recommend to all teachers in the world
Very good course that has given an overview of using and implementing online learning tools to meet the expectation of contemporary education system.
Great course gives me more self confidence for teaching online
Very good course and in more in depth than expected. The videos were well done, even though some were a bit repetitive in terms of the information presented. Many had multiple interviews with different professors all stating the same thing, why x,y, or z is important when teaching online. Other videos were very informative, especially when delving deeper into one area. I was impressed with the way the course was structured and how individualized resource lists were made. I was sometimes disappointed with the outdated resources, even though some are quite good. I never saw a single resource that was from the past 5 years, so I feel that the course is in need of some updating, especially considering that technology changes fast. Otherwise, I did learn a lot and felt that I was challenged enough as well. I would recommend this course for sure.
Excellently structured, well paced and adequately supported through online resources. The course practices what it preaches. It has been designed keeping in mind the important principle of constructive alignment. At the end of the course, I could reflect upon my own practice and even plan a class using technology. What I also liked about the course was it's assessment pattern which included both formative ungraded self assessments as well as peer reviewed summative assessments. At no point in the course did technology overtake pedagogy. Technology was smartly used to even generate personalized recommendations based on our answers in the formative assessments. A big thanks to the Simon McIntyre and Neghin Mirriahi for  sharing your expertise with us.
the course is well designed , the assignment very clear mapping . I am really enjoyed and benefit so much from this course, wad an excellent experiences for me that was informative and very well prepared. this course is polishing and reinforced my experiences in teaching and learning, specially I have gained my Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE) in the UK 2012 fromUK Higher Education Academy (HEA), and as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), I am really glad to take part in the informative course , and it is prove my theory of learning  in my PhD thesis in the UK. Thank you so much COURSERA  and thank you so much for the great instructors DR. Simon Mclntyre and DR. Negin MirriahrBest safaa
First I'd like to thank God for  this blessing of finishing my course "Learning to Teach Online" with Coursera, to my two Professor Dr.Negim Mirriahi and Simon Mclntyre , to Cousera, and to the all contributors who share their knowledge of expertise and experiences. I've learned a lot from this course, I'd like to commend also my peers fellow classmate in this course for their constructive feedback to help me improve.taking the course  help me a lot learning about different technologies as tools ;on how I can plan and deliver my pedagogy of instructions effectively  in Digital Learning . Cousera is one of the best  online platform to learn and thank you for your great endeavor of helping and sharing knowledge for Free...
Very well organized, presented and implemented. (Y) I have a suggestion to make: like the two assignments (which were graded) if you can add any such activity which is peer reviewed like the assignments but may not be graded because adding this to grade will make things cumbersome. Why I want to add more peer reviewed (ungraded) assignments? Because it increases the interest level as they are engaged with each other. But if the (new) assignments are not graded, may be people skip it. Yes! So, the (new) assignments can be made compulsory requirement for the completion of the course, thus people who want to complete the course will have to go through the (ungraded) assignment too. Thanks (Y)
This course has a great impact on current and future educators of the world. Anyone who is interested in education will gain important information in this amazing course. The most important information I gained is that technology and Education is the future. I think this course is a great place to start in learning how to integrate online teaching, online technology and exactly how to go about doing it. This program is well designed, its not too heavy and complicated for any learner. I thought I knew enough about Online Teaching when a colleague recommend this course but boy was I wrong. Anyone who takes this course will leave with some greater knowledge on how to become a better teacher.
I took the course to improve my teaching skills during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course helped me to learn about the taxonomy for learning, teaching and assessing based on Bloom`s Taxonomy, of which I had never heard or read before. Also about selecting technologies based on the desired learning outcomes. For example, I didn't quite understood how and for what purpose to use a Forum; now, I do.  All the bibliographical references and videos were very rich and assertive.  Besides, I also learned how to assure the quality of my course and how to get student feedback to improve my course. Thank you very much for such a well planned and rich course. Impressive! Thank you! I enjoyed it!
For anyone worried about having to teach online and being thrown into the deep end, this is an excellent starter to finding out about the concepts and theory behind online lessons. While using new technology may seem daunting, the course guides you through the major issues and provides recommendations and support specifically tailored to your individual needs. At no point do you feel you are on your own.There is also an abundance of good advice, thought provoking questions well-produced materials to help you along the way,I have recommended this course to a number of my colleagues as an introduction to teaching online.
This is my first course in the coursera. I am a clinician and also spend time on transfer of knowledge and and skills to community health care professionals by using blended training. Everything  is five star about this course . The important sections for me was different learning tools, learning outcomes, engagement of the learners and assessment. The course is designed very nicely with small video, links to quality materials and peer review. Because of my busy schedule, i would mostly go through the course during my long travel to hospital. Thanks to Simon, Negin and UNSW team to have such a wonderful course. Thanks
I really enjoyed getting all these great ideas and an insight in the various aspects related to online teaching and learning. It has been my first online course, and I realise how convenient and flexible online learning can be. What I liked most, was that you always encouraged us to think outside of the box but at the same time made clear that we should design our own learning activities for our student with regards to our own situation at our insititutions and prerequisites. That took away the pressure and gave me the freedom to reflect on my teaching. I got great ideas that I'm trying out with my students now.
This course is very helpful to everyone,in my case this widen my knowledge to different online technology that is very helpful in the delivery of my instructional material. Thank you so much Dr. Simon and Dr. Nigen for sharing your expertise, i really appreciate your effort in discussing each topic that can be easily understood by individuals like me who is not a computer savvy. Thank you so much and God bless always.Hoping you can help me to obtain my certificate, i enroll this course for free  but as i go along i thought i want to have certificate from this course. Once again thank you so much.

Now thanks to this course I have obtained many skills necessary for successful online teaching!
Its really a mandate course for all higher education faculty fraternity. Through this course, I learned many things like lesson planning, how to integrate my course objectives to course outcomes. Which online tools are the right one to assess student performance, For me its like win-win approach both for the students and faculty. For this, I must thank our GITAM UNIVERSITY for providing this prestigious platform COURSERA to listen to intellectual sources and especially the resources and links which are provided are very much useful for me at present and also my future inventories, Thanks a lot
This is an excellent choice for teachers or any professional that has a corporate trainer role. Regardless of your level, if you take this course you will clearly analyze and evaluate the role of the technologies, e.g: Web 2.0, LMS and others,  and the common challenges found when trying to use them.  For instance, I understand that we cannot use technology just to amplify or extend our teaching status quo. Students will react differently and they have different self-realization aims while experiencing the ever-changing real world and professional challenges.  Come and see!
A fantastic course!!! An incredibly substantial one, containing a multitude of useful links and recommendations. The latter are flexible, individual-oriented and depend on how  familiar you are with certain aspects of online teaching and certain technical issues. I have been interested in online teaching for a while and have watched a number of webinars, but I had never seen anything of the kind! That's fabulous. really. Expressing my profound gratitude to the creators of the course who have contributed so much to switching my online teaching to the brand new level.
'Learning to Teach Online' course helped me to develop my  teaching competencies and skills using technology. As the education is completely shifted to online platform all over the world, due to the pandemic situation, this course has very much importance and relevance nowadays. The excellent lectures by Associate Professor Simon McIntyre and Dr. Negin Merriahi, enabled me to learn the content with more ease and efficiency. Thank you coursera and UNSW for providing this excellent course to all learners around the world.
Good opportunity to learn through the course and through the peer members in the discussion forum. It was very much interesting and helpful during their pandemic, where we are all looking forward to online learning practice. This course has helped me to shape up my online teaching plan and, strategies to be followed, the ethics, the requirement of necessary tools, the do's and don't during online teaching. The wonderful and most useful course at the right time by the right people. Thank you for the opportunity.
An amazing course conducted extremely well by Simin Mckintyre and Negin Merriahi. I have been into e-learning for over 20 years now. However, this course has given me so many insights and markers into planning, setting up and evaluating a vibrant e-learning environment. I would highly recommend this course for teachers from school level to teachers in higher education institutes. The Covid Pandemic has created a situation where  all teachers need to go online. This course is pure gold.
The Learning to Teach Online was a well organized and structured course, appropriate course materials and academic literature, video guidance and tips to look for when reading recommended text and in completing each of the parts n the course. It has help me to review several new online teaching tools available in the technology market. It was certainly a very good exposure and I am excited to future my learning on how to use the different types of online software. Thanks and Cheers.
The course is excellently designed. Making training interactive, interesting is the NEED OF THE HOUR. The course structure covers each topic systematically and is easy to understand and implement.The design of assignments is amazing. It makes you think of ideas to make sessions more interactive and interesting. The videos prompts the practical ideas.The Case studies videos shares vital experiences for industry experts. It was  really inspiring.Special thanks SIMON and NEGIN
It's deeply substantial.  It is very relevant now more than ever since schooling will really be online until a vaccine on COVID-19 is discovered.  This course has equipped me with the tools I need to improve my teaching.  I have saved all the websites for future readings; plus, you provided us with other platforms that we have never seen or discovered before.  I shall be recommending some of them to our institution so the license can be institutional as well.Thank you.
I liked the course much. I have got many different interesting things, and I have changed my own position in some things. I began to use many of the advised mechanisms in my own teaching practice to improve learning. I may conclude that my own courses became better and more interesting. Online and blended learning may be interesting and useful. This course helped me to understand this and accept it. Thank you very much for the possibility! Wish you all the best!
A very unique course, with a detailed questionnaire-based activity helping one find his or her current status when it comes to online teaching, lots of resource materials to read depending upon your need, case study videos, methodologies on different aspects of online teaching, and sincere efforts by course administrators Prof. Simon Mclntyre and Dr. Negin Mirriahi in Q&A sessions, helping millions of educators to be confident in using online teaching tools.
It was detailed and helped me to understand a lot on online teaching. In india, online teaching had not been practised. Just when the COVID pandemic striked India, has India taken a sudden leap towards online teaching. Mobiles had been banned for use for college students inside the campus even the day before the pandemic struck and immediately when personal contact was not possible, they expect the teachers and students to shift to online mode overnight.....
I Thank wholeheartedly,  the faculty members Dr Simon Mclntyre  and Dr Negin Mirrahi who developed this course and  also the supporting staff . You are all doing a great service to faculty members working in different parts of the world . I thank the authorities of UNSW and the Australian Government for supporting this Project . Thank You Once again - Dr M Thiru Chitrambalam , Professor , dept. of Mechanical Engineering , AVIT , Chennai , India
Fantastic Course. this is not like a subject. This course will take us to known to unknown. I thorougly enjoyed each and every bit of sessions. Now i started applying the techniques in my regular teachings and evaluation. Thank you so much Dr Negin and Prof. Simon for your wonderful sessions. sessions beautifully designed and executed. I could see your hardwork and concern in each and every module and assessment. Thank you so much once again.
Thanks for giving an opportunity to learn with plethora of experts. I was about to give up but the motivation that wad given to me by this course and others helped me a lot completing this course. This online experience is one of the remarkable and phenomenal for its comprehensiveness. I am looking forward to enrolling your course once again. Rest assured, all the learning Iâve got will be applied. Again, my sincerest gratitude everyone!
This course is intelligently design to help me as an educator to improve what I know and what I can, as well as provided me a lot of information that will make me more confident to teach most specially online. Thank you to all the intelligent people behind this program. Congratulations for bringing out another person in me to become more fruitful and willing to share nd payback your good deeds. More successful years to come to all of you
Excellent course. I am new to this field and learned a lot. Lots of well developed and organized materials and videos. My only recommendation is that we should maybe do the first assignment after the 2nd week. I did not feel I was knowledgeable enough to start reviewing other students' assignments after just the first week in the course. Again, thank you for developing and conducting this course. Michael D. Roberts, New York City, USA
It is an excellent course. I would like to thank the training team for the very well designed course. You practice what you preach in your course. Designing the online course, aligning the learning outcomes with the objectives. Self assessments, Peer assessments etc. Step wise videos and training material is made available. Thank you very much for the fantastic course, with exposure to various types of technologies.
Excellent course. This was my first time attending a course via Coursera. It works very well with the assignments and peer assessments. The assessment rubric is a very good way to assess other people's work. I have learned a lot with the help of the case studies and the practical assignments. Very well set up and structured learning environment, I can recommend it to anyone interested in designing online learnings.
The course requires a lot of reading but the content is somewhat individualized based upon the level of education you teach at. I did learn quite a bit about teaching online through this course and have a much better understanding of how it needs to be delivered quite differently than traditional in-person teaching. The class provides a lot of different information and you can choose which areas to read more about.
Really a well planned and aligned course, which helped me to understand the available online tools, the suitability of the tools in courses, besides learning about course alignment, the evaluation module has improved my understanding of "Teaching online".Next time if I will use any technology/tool/resource for my blended teaching and learning this course of, course era will be my reference. Thank you Course era.
This course was so helpful. I am most grateful that I started it when I did, given the arrival of Covid.  I found the structure very user friendly, the content adaptable for a wide variety of applications and the resources on all topics extensive and helpful.   The course instructors did a wonderful job of developing and delivering a course that exemplifies the possibilities of a well-designed online course.
Its a great course. In our profession, and I think in all professions except the profession of teaching itself, we are not formally trained to teach our specialty curriculum, or to design and evaluate it. So in this regard, in addition to learning online teaching, this course has created an awareness about many core ideas on teaching itself, and this will also help me in my future teaching assignments.
It's a very nice course, Very exhaustive and elaborate.  Really taught me so many things and concepts related to online teaching.   Hope you keep giving me access to this course even after I finish this course, so that I can always use this for reference.  That way it will motivate me to recommend the course to others as well.  Thanks a lot and Best wishes to all who join this course.  Happy learning!
This course was better than I thought it would be. I love how informative it is and how I was able to immediately apply that knowledge. The Professors are awesome with their approach to assisting with each of the assignments and how they guide you through each module. In addition and most important for me, was the amount of resources that was given to support and guide my understanding. Thank You!!!
Coursera has
helped me organize my way of planning for preparing the e-Modules for online
classes; and the modules in Learning to Teach Online gave me additional insights about the strategies
of blended and flipped learning of students, the importance of teacher-presence
in online classes and the good effects of giving constructive feedback to studentsâ
submission of their assignments and projects.
I have learnt a lot in this course as I learnt how to use new tools to increase student engagement and learnt how to motivate students and enhance their learning by learning from peers . I learnt new online models and how to apply a diversified approach when designing an online activity. Then I learnt evaluation techniques and thus keep on improving to enhance the learning experience of students .
This course is really helpful in providing authentic online learning experience at the Graduate School Level, because it really encourages learners to write their own idea and cite supporting literature and evidence that the idea really works. Better yet if all the Links provided in the individual reading assignments are visited regularly to check accessibility.    Thanks for the learning...
This is a well planned course. I am happy to have gone through this eventhough I have been doing e-learning for 2 years now, I still get very good tips and receive new materials to read and also the two professors touched on issues I never thought off before. The Forum community is great, the Moderators gave good Feedbacks and their online presence is definately there. The participants
This course has been so useful! I learned a lot about instructional design and methods to teach online in a conscious, rigorous and efficient way. I really enjoyed going through the content and interacting with the class, and doing the two assignments. Obviously, the designers of this class are themselves experts of online teaching! Thank you so much for making me a better teacher.
For a person who has just begun online teaching and now its become very important, I guess this was one of the courses that helped me understand how Online technology can be more interactive and make it effective. As it was a suggested course by my colleague, I recommend and suggest others to definitely take up this course as it has a lot of learning and enriching experience.
Thank you for a great course.  Great presentation style with lots of opportunities to ask questions and talk about real-life examples which all made for a really enjoyable and informative course."This has more than met my expectations.A wonderfully practical course - both personally and professionally.  I will take away lots of things that I can quickly and easily apply.
This was a well needed course! Eye opening and enlightening! I have learned a lot from it and i am going to gain more confidence in the presentation of online learning using the different platforms through practice! Planning and designing a winning way of teaching online is what is needed these days! So thank you so much to the facilitators! You have made a difference!
I appreciate fully the impressive construction of all contents and resources in this course. I'd love thanking personally everyone behind this immensely useful project. Cheers. I'm forever grateful. I'd be even gladder if you give at least sort of a free, little certificate fo those who could not afford the real certificate.  Please. Thanks. Send it to my email please.
One of the best courses I've ever taken. The resources provided are very practical, covering every aspect you can imagine. I particularly liked the personalized recommendations, which addressed my needs. Thank the whole team so much for offering such a thorough teaching training course. Because of your help, I feel so confident in delivering my online lessons now.
I learnt an important lesson that online technologies can not be blindly used for all of the teaching and assessment tasks. One needs to identify the right tool for the right task. Though I was aware of what-is-what, this course has given the right insight into exactly what is to be done.Thanks to UNSW, the Instructors and Coursera for this wonderful opportunity.
The researches and case studies presented in the course are so relevant and relatable. It also gave a lot of insights and best practices to be applied in my institution and course design and learning environment. Thank you also for having a live Q&A session for the cohort. I felt the presence of the course professors all throughout the duration of the course. :)
This was a good course for beginners planning to teach online or blended courses. However, some of the optional videos did not add much value. While peer-reviewing other participant's assignments, I observed that some participants did not pay much attention to what they have been asked to do. I guess you may add a video emphasising how to address the prompts.
The course gave me a very deep reflection on teaching and learning in the online scenario. The materials available are of high quality and the classes and case studies complemented the course objectives well. I also felt engaged to discuss in the forum and the instructors were excellent in their explanations. I feel confident enough to teach online! Thankful!
Great Efforts by the Instructors in designing the Course. Really the Instructors have spent a lot of time in designing the course, which was evidently seen in the content. Moreover both the Instructors were very good in putting the things right on the Platter. Hats off to the Instructors for designing this course. Really it was a good Learning Experience.
The course was truly helpful in my ability to learn new technologies and novel teaching strategies. I am so grateful to have taken part in this course under such amazing facilitators -- Dr. Negin Mirriahi and Simon McIntyre. They were magnanimously patient, gracious towards the participants, and awesome in their own ways!  Thank you so much to you both!
I think it is a well designed course,very useful for those in Higher learning/college teaching/technological field teaching situations.A little more on School level options and work would make it more holistic in approach,though I understand the constraints,obligations-smaller children,restrictions on using options etc.Overall great learning option!
This was an excellent course to do. Though I had read a few books on the topic of conducting online classes, a practical orientation was needed. Through this course I could understand the minute things a teacher can do to make her/ his online classes interesting and engaging. I am grateful to Coursera and my university for introducing this course.
Excellent course. Well done duo. I really appreciate the way Simon and Negin have developed the course, assessed the learning outcomes, and specifically the communication skills of both. Throughout the course, they both set us an excellent delivery of an online course. The course itself is a fabulous example for that. keep up all your good work!!

Tough course
Before, I embarked on enrolling the course, I consider my experience in online teaching as below par since I believe i still lack the knowledge needed to carry out an effective online course. The course covered almost all of the rudiments of online teaching. The modules were well designed to students both beginners and with moderate level of online knowledge.  The lecturers/resource persons in each module showed high level of expertise in their own fields. At first, I had a hard time coping with the earlier part of the course probably due to much distraction brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, however all my anxieties disappeared as the course progressed and I became more focused with the lessons/modules. Finishing the course, really boosted my confidence. Thank you so much.
This course was excellent in getting one to think about teaching online. It highlighted for me that thought our students might be digital citizens and digitally competent, they may not be digitally literate with the technology/software that I decide to use to impart instruction in class. It helped me to understand that our role is not reduced as teachers simply because our students are now online, but if anything, our role has now become increasingly important to facilitate the engagement of students and to ensure that no one is left behind or feels left out of the teaching/learning experience.
Digital
environment becomes a crucial part of our lives.  In order to stay relevant and increase
students' interest, we should take it into consideration by incorporating
various virtual tools and methods into our educational process. The situation
with Covid-19 has made us all realize the importance of acceleration of this
process. It was beneficial for me to take into account the experience and opinions of other teachers and in the area.
This course helped me understand the diversity of digital methods and tools
that exist, and thus, become better equipped to use them in my work
This course provided me with enough material to enable me to improve my online teaching skills. Modules were very well presented with some optional activities. The self-evaluation exercises with personalized recommendations were to the point and the reading material suggested will keep me busy for some time to come. Assignments were relevant and will help with future work. The last part with Q&A was a nice touch with numerous examples. Great course and highly recommended.
This course is perfectly designed for pre-service/ in service teachers who are still novice towards technology. Due to the Covid-19, we all had to take a paradigm shift in online education. In this situation, this course really helped me to enrich my knowledge in using technological tool for the benefits of online teaching. Each and every module was beautifully designed with proper information. I would highly recommend this course and I am highly satisfied with this one.
I was very happy with the course, Learning to Teach Online from UNSW Sydney (University of New South Wales). I am sorry to be English, my second language, and not having a command of English. But I confess that the course is good, I made an effort out of my reality, as for English. The course offers you many tools to improve the quality of online work for teachers and their students. I do recommend this course! The lectures are clear and objective.
Thank you very much!
Really appreciate each one of the contributions in peer learning and evaluation. This course teaches a lot about online learning tools, which can be effectively used in teaching. Teaching can be made simple and effective by using these tools. Really appreciate the course. If a person read all documents carefully and watch videos then he/she can get quite a detailed knowledge. I would apply these tools in my teaching also for my students better learning.
This is an excellent introduction to Online teaching, especially for someone who would like to transit from face to face teaching to online environment. There are loads of case study examples and external resources, to the point of posing a problem of plenty! The most valuable aspect is that the personalized recommendations to address your improvement areas - as diagnosed from your responses to the ungraded activities.
The course was not easy, it involved a lot of work and referencing but it was so interesting! It took me step by step through the process of getting familiar with online technologies and tools. The periodic feedback was so helpful. As I am a senior consultant, not much accustomed to online teaching-learning till now, it was a great experience to take this course and today feel more confident about teaching online.
I have learnt a lot about On line teaching methods including why online teaching is important specially at the present day senario, open and Institutionally supported technologies, planning on line learning, on line teaching, on line learning activities, on line resourses, on line assessment strategies, engaging and motivating students, and evaluation strategies. I am enriched with all these knowledges.
This course has been an eye opener for me on a number of areas. It is a real game changer in these days when teachers have had to learn how to teach online sometimes on their own! I feel grateful that I got the opportunity to learn through this course. The instructors do practice what they preach as I felt their presence through out the entire course.
The course was outstanding. The videos were very much helpful in enhancing the knowledge. presentations by Simon and Negin were awesome!! The pedagogy part was most liked by me .Assignments were also interesting.  Assessment, evaluation, feedback and interaction part were also very good.
It was a great course! The Instructors were lucid, pleasant and reassuring. The Course is well thought out and the design is learner friendly. The videos are really interesting and informative. The reading material is a treasure. I loved the journey--thank you.
