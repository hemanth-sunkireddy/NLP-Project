very basic. for novices. not worth it to pay money for it
The explanation on the course itself is easy to understand, although it does not cover much, just simple examples. However, the main problem is when it comes to the assignments, you really struggle (not only me but you can notice it by the number of people mentioning the same thing in the forum chat) - the reason you struggle is because the assignment is given with questions in details but you were not taught in such details. I had to google further info to resolve the questions. My suggestion is: add more info on the course with much more details (equal to the assignments given) or give a simple assignment question. Also, the questions in the assignment are not very clear and well explained, you feel that you have not really watched the video - although when you try to redo all the excels as per on the videos I really do them quickly.
Data set was US-centric without a ROW data option. I ended up spending more time on figuring out how to format the data rather than focusing on the course, which is s pity for several reasons:I am an experienced xlsx user and was taking this course only to understand what the focus was on for subsequent courses, and I was interested in doing the overall specialization as the syllabus fits my interests very much
Really disappointing. I was expecting a decent introduction to data analysis using excel is was like a simple version of the excel manual. The whole course took me less than a day to complete and I am not excel competent. In the end I gave up and started working on the Microsoft virtual academy courses. Needs improvement.
the text files at start of course very unclear. could not proceed, as was unable to find support for help to my questions, which was disappointing
Poor sound quality. One of the answers for the quizzes could be correct for the people using older than 2019 versions of Excel.
Simple information such as the workbook for analysis is difficult to download and the teaching staff are not helpful
Am not satisfied with the question given in the practice quiz . They are not given the explanation part properly
Instructor didn't explain how the data got on the spreadsheet. He just kind of started the work.
This class is hard to follow and does not give enough practice to reinforce the skills.
Won't let me proceed to Week 2 of the course without waiting for a week. Ridiculous.
NOT GOOD AND IT IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIAN ACCENT
very easy course thankyou
Very bad explanations.
The course has a lot of potential, but some questions in the quizz are very ill posed, not clear, and ambiguous. I am surprised that this course has passed the usually high quality barriers of Coursera. The course would benefit greatly from well structured and clearly defined questions in the quizz. Either a little bit more text explaining what the questions is looking for or a short example.
This is just an Excel basics course. But the word Data Analysis misguides, as if this is at some advanced or at moderate level. Those who have working experience in excel may not find this course interesting or may not get much of new learnings. It teaches about some commonly used features in excel. Thats it! This has nothing to do with data analysis.
lessons are very draggy. exercises prepare data  very cleanly at hand for you, does not let you simulate real working conditions where you need to know how to prepare data (e.g. what columns i must have etc). does not teach you the thinking bit behind these exercises.
The course is very slow paced. It should be clearly mentioned that the course is for total beginners. I did not expect that lecturer will spend time on so basic information like adding/deleting/renaming various sheets within one excel file...
I learnt some new skills but there is a serious disconnect between the teaching materials and the assessments, the assessments are significantly harder and you are not given any opportunity to practice before the assessment!
The audio quality of the course is extremely poor, can barely hear the professor. Please check assessment of Week 2, I have tried multiple methods and got the same result however it keeps showing as incorrect.
The lecture delivery is not bad, But the quiz exercises are unnecessarily difficult and sometimes, totally unrelated to the lecture. it makes it difficult for one to move to the next stage.
It's too simple, and the courses are kind of redundant. Maybe it is proper for those who have never used Excel. For other people, the courses are too easy.
Pretty basic course with a lot of 'dead time' not really learning anything about Excel. Tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topics.
Very basic course, course certificate has no university logo on it. Not worth the money.
voice of the instructor is not clear. Weekly assignments are not so friendly too.
Questions asked were in a very difficult manner.
Money maker for University.  Cheers to Ric
Good course, but would be good if it was similar to Macquarie's Excel Course, in terms of providing Exercise material to practice with while watching the videos.
Lectures were great however questions on the quizzes were very poorly written. They should be a lot more specific
This course is an excellent source to start with basic of excel and charts and diagrams
Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel.  However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade.  You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.
The concepts in this introductory course are very important and have improved my confidence with Excel. The professor did a good job of explaining why you would use the different functions and techniques. However, it would have been helpful if there were slides available from this course to help with reviewing. I also had a gripe with the consistent appearance of material on quizzes that was not covered in the lectures. I actually had to look up some of the concepts independently, because they were either not in the course or were introduced superficially.
Good explanations from the professor, however uses older version of excel in videos than I do. Also, importing the .txt files was quite the challenge as I do not use the same number denominator and date format as in the US. After a bit of struggling, I got it to work, but wasted time = not excellent reviews. Did not learn much new, only a few tips.
Hello!First of all, I have gotten great pleasure while completing this course.There is a lot of useful information about analysis of date.But files for exercises have to be upgraded or added new for mac users. Because of this fact, I had to finish the last quiz in week 4 not by using Excel. I had to use Google Sheets.
I faced different kinds of difficulties while submitting assignment which was not taught by the tutor,hence I came to know that using utube and forum etc etc. as for example scatter plot from pivot table I came to know that through forum and add how to add insert tab in the ribbon I came to know that from youtube .
need more practice assignment with equal difficulty level as graded assignment because there are few question which seems to be wrong due to high in difficulty level as teach in video .rest course is good to one who have some knowledge in past.it really increase my knowledge . thank you to all.
Sir, mainly I wanted to have a practice of chart which I could not get properly.and one thing I want to share that as in the starting of the lecture sheets were shared which was done in the class so it was too much help full for practice but in the later classes, sheets were not shared.
I thought that some instructions were confusing, or at least I thought I understood them, but didn't ever get the right answer and then felt I was wasting my time. It's always odd to take these classes and not get examples of the 'right' answer or the ideal way to get to an answer.
Excel version used is different than mine and I really struggled with it. Besides, my Excel is in spanish and the one from the course is in English and instructions or funtions are named different. It was hard, very hard due to the above mentioned.
The class material was okay, but the instructor repeated himself all the time. I would prefer to not have someone tell me that they are going to do something and then tell me what they are doing while they do it.
This course cover necessary topics that are required for data analysis. Problem is with graded quizzes because the instructor didn't give feedback on wrong answers or any important answer.
Presentation is good. Concepts explained in a simple and clear manner. Missing interactivity which is very important to retain the understanding of the concepts explained.
quiz where tough and questions with solution would have helped to learn. since the goal is to learn i think. and not many shortcuts where used in videos
In the first week course, the dates are in a different format. Fixing this is next-level excelling and that cannot be the aim for a first week course.
Sometimes the test questions are very difficult to understand.  Excel file for week 4 exam did not seem to work, I had to copy
Good knowledge sharing sessions but could have been more informative like usage of "Power Query" & others was most expected.
The basics have been explained in video but the quiz questions can't be solved without a pre-requisite of MS-Excel.
Sometimes felt like the "right" answers were wrong, or that I was failing at something they never taught us to do.
not include VBA which I need most in excel.I plan to cancel after tried it but it charged me 50 $ in the end.
I extremely basic course, I would suggest a diagnosis or level set to define where new students should start
The course teaches you what you should have known for colleague, but doesn't get into advanced techniques.
The level of the course and graded quizzes do not match. Quizzes are more advanced.
could have been a bit more engaging. the videos are quite boring (sorry!)
Should be indicated the level of complexity as easy/101. Well explained
the sound quality has to be increased. the overall course is very good
Could prove to be a great introductory course for absolute beginners
Could have included more material and introduced more functions.
Should include more assignments, case studies and challenges.
Absolutely beginner. I didn't learned a lot from this course.
This course is perfect for learners with no excel experience.
Audio should have been a bit high.  More details required
I found the exams is so difficult related the explanation
Nice, but needs update for new excel version
It was very basic. No additional reading.
try to add more detail its too basic
Practical but is missing more detail
Question is very tricky  :(
Hard to solve without hint
The course is arranged extremely well and the Instructor has made sure that every point gets through through several examples.Would definitely recommend the course if you're looking to get a basic/fundamental understanding of making your way around excel.One issue I faced throughout the course was the worksheets to be downloaded, especially for graded assignments, often had errors in the data types. The 'date' field seemed to be messed up almost always, making it difficult to follow what was being taught. Now, this might be due to differences in the versions of Excel being used, but it is an important point nonetheless. Wonderful course!
An excellent course. Only negative is that it is hard to remember some of the procedures for such a condensed class that has few practice problems. On each of the first three exams, I only scored 90% because I could not figure out one process. And the T.A.'s, although helpful, were not able to explain what I needed to do correctly to be able to successfully solve those problems. It would be helpful after successfully completing the course to be able to request and receive the answers and procedures for select questions on the weekly quizzes.
Excellent course and I definitely  learned valuable information.  I would like to have more guidance and/or examples regarding when each function would be useful or appropriate and also the limitations of each function (examples of when it could not be used).  Also, I would love additional practice - maybe each week could offer (as an option) many additional exercises for those of us who want to further master the skills of that lesson.
Clear and concise instruction. You learn basic Excel. After completing the first course, it is an open question whether this course and the rest in the specialization is actually worth the monthly fee. Edit: this is a good introduction to the hard skills in Excel required in further courses, but as a standalone Excel course I think there are better options. Nonetheless, as part of the specialization this is well done.
I learned some significant skills manipulating data in Excel.  My only criticism is the quizzes do not test learned skills.  They are very discouraging when time after time I cannot achieve the right answer.  The lectures need to demonstrate some of the more nuanced skills that are referenced in the quizzes.  Other than that, I can honestly say this has been the most enriching course in Excel that I have ever taken.
Good Course on introduction Data Analysis using Excel. I was expecting it to cover Data Analysis tool in MS Excel in depth. If entire Data Analysis tool is covered as a part of this course, it will really become a 5 star course. But other than this whatever else is there in the course is covered really well. A very good course for someone who is relatively new to MS Excel and Data Analysis.
If you don't know anything about Excel, then trust me, you are at the right course. This course will thoroughly guide you through the very basics of Excel. Some advanced functions and shortcuts are not well explained, but the course is worthy of itself. I am damn sure that the challenging assignment questions will ensure that  you'll never forget the lessons taught by the Professor.
Very practical and well explained videos. Works as a recap for those who want to freshen up their skills but also for someone who hasn't used the various functionalities of excel much. An enhancement opportunity would be to explain the correct answers in quizzes and tests - sometimes you just don't get what you did wrong or why an answer is wrong/right?
The course is good and it is very helpful for upcoming life. The way of course run in also imperative but I have problem on quiz, to understanding the question, they did not justify meaning of the question, I mean what does question want from us, that's why I am not able to do all question on every quiz.but I did not feel any problem on course.
QUIZZES ARE REALLY SIMPLE AND NOT REFLECTIVE ENOUGH ON THE LESSONS. HOWEVER, THE WEEKLY EXAMS ARE GREAT PRACTICE AND MORE CHALLENGING. THE VIDEO LECTURES ARE GREAT AND HIGHLY VALUED TO VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS ALONG WITH ACCESS TO ALL OF THE DATA FILES TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE VIDEOS. THANKS. OVERALL, IT IS A GREAT BEGINNERS CLASS.
It was very nice to get my skills expanded. I would be very helpful, if the professor included handouts with functions, definitions, and instruction (e.g. on how to create a histogram). This way it would help to review something later without the need to open the videos again and searching for the content one is looking for.
This was an interesting introduction to excel data analysis. The course was very well explained. However, for the graph course section,  options are different using newer version of excel and I would have liked to see a section on standard error bars as it is a very important part of research and development data analysis.
I like the style of Instructor. Language is very simple and understandable. Instructor never throw or  make jargon of  words. though it is a very basic (introductory) course I had enjoy learning, brush off my old knowledge of Excel.  It would we more meaningful if added more details about Excel.
This course cover a lot of ground on Excel in a short span of time but doesn't skip on information. The practice exercises cement your knowledge and the weekly quizzes really hit it home.I would give 4 stars because I hoped to do a final project which included simulated a real world project.
If you do not have any background in any Excel this course is not for you. Take Excel course for beginners first. Some questions are really tricky and lack some detailed information. I hope they could do something about those. But overall, I have learned a lot. Thank you and more power.
Great Course. There are some problems on the tests that went into much deeper application than the lectures did. While it did provide some learning, I found that having to look it up, and then try to apply it to the test, didn't teach me as well as following along with the lectures.
Very good course for beginners.  Lessons are clear and time use is flawless.The only setback is, the course is a little bit outdated.  They use Excel 2013 I think .   Videos quality could be higher cause 720p in a wide monitor (mine isn't even that big, just  23.8'')  looks blurry.
Course is very interactive and new items are always learned.  Pivot tables section was the best.  Areas of improvement: 1) Update course with Excel 2016 SW (menu difference and defaults) 2, Exam questions are sometimes poorly written, and makes one wonder what is being asked.
The course is very informative. During the video, the professor makes it so easy. I understand it perfectly. However, when it comes to the exercises, it becomes challenging. I wish that for us who had passed the course, a full copy of the files/explanations were given to us.
Solid intro excel course. I competed in < 1 week, w/prior excel skills/knowledge (It would of taken longer if I didn't have excel experience/skills). Pivot tables and charts are very relevant for business analytics, so I think the skills learned can be applied immediately.
I found out I already knew alot of the beginning material in this course. So I just used this course for learning Vlookup, Hlookup, and pivot tables. The histogram section was a nice refresher if you have taken a statistical class before. Very helpful and great examples.
Video quality could be better. Disappointing to not have real-time opportunities to get help/ask questions. Having only forums and no office hours or chat is pretty frustrating since it means having to potentially pause learning for days until there is a response.
The length of the course is very overestimated: for every quiz they have counted 30 minutes but there are only two (extremely easy) questions (like: "What if I write =1+2?"). Four stars because it is probably helpful for those who have never used Excel.
The course is pretty good and equips to develop excellent skill set. The course is fun to learn and gets you involved completely. However, I request to give solution to the quiz which will help us to know appropriate solution to the requested problem.
This course gives an overall insight into how to look at the data and get the required information and result from the so money numbers utilizing Microsoft Excel. a good starter for data analysis career and the first step in excelling the Excel.
It was a valuable session for me. The videos were easy to understand and practice. The quiz at the end was also equally helpful in learning as it was based on practical problems rather than theory based.Thank you overall I enjoyed this lesson
The Course overall was well arranged and well constructed. Helped me a lot. Only complaint I have is that the lesson on "Pivot Table" was quite hasty. You should one extra lesson on practicing "Pivot Table" problems and related resources.
I loved the course overall. Each and every aspect of the course are explained clearly and quiz after every lesson is a good idea. But questions in week3 cumulative quiz are not easily understandable else everything went great. Thank you!
Very useful overall, some improvement can be made in the way certain quiz questions are stated and in developing more specific FAQs for excel compatibility issues that users might face. All in all a very good experience.
The only thing I didn't like was the practice quizzes which were too many and too interruptive of the natural course flow in my opinion. Everything else makes for a very nice course to get started with data analysis.
The course is a great reviewer for those of us who stopped creating business reports. The sample files and demonstration need to be updated to show the new look of Microsoft 365 and how to change chart features.
Would appreciate if the question is answered incorrectly the explanation is given as some questions are not easily understood. Would like to see more analytical tools used, example power query, power BI etc.
Thank you Coursera provide me platform to learn how excel will use to solve business problem and how to use of excel tool for data analysis. Instructor was provide us valuable information through video.
The course is good . It gives emmense knowldege about how to analyse a data using powerful convinient and fast excel tools. Though its a basic course but good for those whose excel is not that strong.
Questions was not clear. Week 2 formula can explain more. The quiz totally made us confused. Not much help either. The histogram can also explain a little more. Mostly quite smooth. Thanks teacher!
Good course to learn advance functions of Excel but some questions in the final quizzes were not completely understandable, its the only thing that annoys me. Apart from this I enjoyed this course.
This course Gave me a outline understanding of Stock and sales indeed which Helped me Crack Retail Interview as a store Head .manually working on Spread sheet and Analysing out Come was amazing ...
This is very useful session, Hostogram is very new to me, it is clearly explained in the session. I have applied some functions in my day to day actual practice. Thanks for the wonderful session
Learning materials are super easy to learn, explained step by step and detailed with patience by Mr.Sharad Borle. However, quizzes were little complicated. Thank you for your time and help.
The course is helpful for beginners. I appreciated the professor, he was clear and simpatethic. Perhaps a more in depth dive in some functions and/or tool would be appreciated.Thanks
Quizzes at the end of every session were quite helpful. Also, the examples during lectures helped a lot in understanding the topic well. Overall, it was a great learning experience.
It was very clear and helpful, but also very basic. I would recommend if you are just trying to learn the basics, but I would not recommend if you are already pretty knowledgeable.
It is a good course. The only thing that I will add is the option of clicking f(x) for finding the formulas rather than spelled out the formula; but that is my personal preference.
This course was extremely helpful especially if you need to learn the basics of excel. It would have been helpful to see the answers to the questions that I could not figure out.
Course is Good. But The Practice Questions are very confusing. Cant Understanding, from which tab we should apply the question. I Request you to make the Questions more clearly.
The course was well taught, but too basic for me, and so for that reason I gave one less star. For somebody who has never used excel, this course would be a good introduction.
Very good course which provided a good starting base for using excel for non-experienced users. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends with similar knowledge level
Firstly Thank You for this Amazing Course. The Course is very Excellent as well as Easy to Understood.All points on Excel are clear and is very useful in point of education.
Great intro. Need more homework/assignments to solidify knowledge. Quizzes and tests are relatively easy. That said, the testing builds on previous weeks which is FANTASTIC!
A very good course that teaches essentials on the basics of Excel. However, I only can put 4 stars because some parts lack in-depth explanations of when and how to use it.
Liked the length of the videos (which are less than 10 minutes) which allows you to finish one topic at a stretch. The questions were relatively challenging for this user.
An excellent introductory course on MS EXCEL and it's data analysis capabilities. Practice questions could have been greater in number and a little more difficult though.
Everything is very good about this course, but the assignments are very hard, you need a lot of deep work and the examples and sample quiz are so basic type of thing
Great course, very helpful - though a few issues around the techincal wording and interpretation of questions being asked in tests, and more support for Mac users
One question regarding scatter plot exercise I think answer is wrong. Additionally, correct explanations should have been given with solutions for the exercise.
I highly recommend this course it goes in depth with introducing concepts to analyze data using excel. on work of advice, READ QUESTIONS CAREFULLY, and THINKKK.
please add some additional material that can be referred for more detailed information and there should be some material for the contents covered in the videos
I would say very thorough overall. I would question the speed at which it is taught, but perhaps that's not what you guys are focused on (faster). Good job!
a clear intro to some basic-moderate user level functions in Excel. Good for those who have yet to use functions and graphing capabilities of the software.
The course is well planned, designed & communicated. However, I was looking for a higher level of difficulty in problem solving and more excel techniques.
This course instruction is very clear and easy to follow (even if you're using a different version of Excel) and covers the core concepts for using Excel.
Very good course for someone who is not an experienced Excel user. For those who work with Excel every day, this course does not offer any new knowledge.
Great course for anyone who uses excels in their profession. I encourage everyone to take the course as it is applicable anywhere, anytime and any work.
In the assessment part if few more details of the question or the hint would have mentioned then it would have been much more suitable in the Quizzes .
Some Questions were very difficult to understand. I struggled there if that could be addressed then the course would be perfect! Thank You Mr Sharad
I thoroughly enjoyed the course , a very good introduction to data analysis using excel , got to explore a lot of datasets and analysis techniques.
Informative and clear. Perhaps it will be nice if there are documents with teaching notes which I can keep alongside with my own handwritten notes!
The course is very well explained by the teacher, but it is too introductory to deserve the name "course 1". It could be week 1 of a bigger course.
Really helpful for those who want to learn how to use excel as a professional. This will really teach you many simple but effective use of excel.
A good course for consolidating essential Excel skills, may be a little basic for some but a good introduction and lead in to the specialisation.
This is very helpful course for one beginner. I have learned a lot from this course.but the sound quality is not so good. But overall its good.
This part of the course helps one re-visit the basics of excel. It is extremely helpful and keeps one upto date with the workings of the same.
Its an excellent course to update your knowledge of statistics through excel. Prof Sharad has used simple yet effective ways to teach. Thanks
Could use harder examples in problems and I feel if you pass quizzes maybe you should see what you did wrong on the questions you got wrong.
The course was fairly easy to follow.  Enjoyed it.  Still a bit shaky with pivot tables but I expect to understand as I keep using it more.
Course is great, it is an overview of useful commands, formulas and so on.  I gave it 4 stars because quiz questions sometimes are unclear
this course is so much helpful for me and know more about excel function more and add a new skill by doing this course through coursera.
This course helped me to understand how Excel can be used to visualize data. It is helpful. Thank you for creating such useful course.
This course is even ideal for people who have worked in Excel before since it revisits some of the important everyday Excel functions.
Very helpful to learn excel especially for beginners.Usage of key board shortcuts can be added to make this course much more fruitful.
Pretty good. I recomend, specially for those who does not know well the capabilities, the functions and the advantages of using Excel.
Very useful and ehlpful and quizzes not so easy as they seam. I recommend a lot this course if your are interested in learning Excel.
its a very useful and effective course in this digital era ... i feel privillaged to get the opportunity of learning . thankyou
A very good and exhaustive course on Microsoft  Excel, data analysis and visualization using excel. A good learning experience.
When I got to the charts section, the software used in the video was a little out of date. Otherwise, this video is fantastic!
Great introduction course into Excel. I took it as my first step into business, and it covered many basic topics in my work.
Explanations of why answers are wrong would be helpful. Otherwise this was a good course and really useful for a beginner.
Quiz's are easy to understand, but Graded quiz's are very difficult to attend because need more clarity on questions
BASICS OF EXCEL SKILLS AND ANALYZING THE DATA ACCORDING TO THE BUSINESS NEEDS THANK YOU MANISH RUPANI +91-7974098903
Some questions were so hard with no real teacher to ask but I figured them all out.   Was a channeling experience.
A great refresher if you've not used Excel for a while and easy to understand if you've never used Excel before.
The course is about very basic excel use. Explanation of each and every formula is very good and so simplified.
Overall good course, I could have used some additional work on charting and Pivot Tables.  Very helpful though.
great Intro course to Excel. Wish they provided example sheets used In the lessons to practice along side with
I believe that the explanation could be more thorough as in some topics as I had to look for external source.
Covers all the basics with good quality examples. The way of teaching is also very simple and easy to follow.
Very clear, good course but if you audit, you won't be able to get the answers to the end of week quizzes.
Quiz doesn't help much. Some of them are very confusing. I think the quiz can be designed/written better.
This course explains the basic for data manipulation and very useful tools to clean data and organize it.
Could be much more better if some advanced excel options and other data analysis methods are introduced.
The professor was quite meticulous with teaching.  The weekly quizzes were challenging and satisfactory.
I enjoyed the course, learned a few useful items. Looking forward to next courses in the specialization.
It was a good review. The examples were brilliant and will immediately help you execute the learnings
Great course!I learn a lot of basic excel, and the course content is easy to follow and understand~!
It's useful, but the content is for only entry to intermediate level. I feel it's too simple for me.
Easy for a novice and very useful, but It would be better if there are more materials for each week.
This course explain well the basic concept of data analysis using excel.I really enjoy the course.
The course was very useful & also the teaching style of the professor was very easy to understand.
Really good course overall. Some of the practice problems needed a bit more detail in the set-up.
A great place to start if you are new to Excel, a little basic for those with good Excel skills.
One of the best online course available for data analysis using Excel as main tool for analysis.
All the excel formulae if added and introduced to would also have been very helpful. Thank you.
It is a nice , to the point course. It would be better if there are some more diverse examples.
For a complete beginner, it's a very clear and straightforward course, yet still challenging.
Great course with tests that verify your conceptual understanding and implementation skills.
The volume in the videos were too low. But the course was great. Very easily understandable.
Useful, helping the entry level excel user to be more familiar with excel function and tips.
The Practice exercises are very well made, they thoroughly test the concept understanding.
Professor Sharold is an amazing teacher I am lucky to be his student. May Allah bless him.
A very good course, but I'd say its too basic and could be explained a bit more precisely.
the course was very helpful and enabled me to understand basic concepts of data analysing
Helped to become more familiar and comfortable with the more difficult concepts of excel.
I think  this is a wonderful introduction to using excel to manipulate data of any kind.
The course was very much helpful. It started with basics and then took to complex part.
It is really and introduction to Excel. Good exercises to practice and remember things

As a beginner, I found this course extremely helpful in developing my excel skills.
Very well organized.Structured wayMany topics covered.Nice set of questions in quiz
Great course. Only drawback is that it is for PC and I took the course using a Mac.
I really enjoyed course, bust the histogram d=should g=have been explained better.
Overall good learning yet it would be fun if there were more examples to play with
The instructor is very good ,it's good way to start your analysis with this course
A course help me a lot in Excel. I can apply what I have learned in my daily work.
Good pace and quiz. Date formatting for those outside the US is a little annoying
It would be better if more information and more challenging exercises were there.
Good, but need more advanced excel material. Great as introduction or beginners.
It is a great course. It allows you to learn fast from basic to advanced Excel.
Not life changing but it told me what I needed to know with a minimum of faff.
very good course and teaching for beginners as well intermediate level larner
A good to have course to get started with Excel for basic level data analysis
Would be better if there are assignments that require longer time to finish.
Very informative and innovative course. Rally useful for my career and job .
Generally,thiswasverygood--butseriouslylackinginlaterweeksindiscussionofMac.
It was a nice course and i learned the basics of data analysis through excel
Everything the instructor did, he did well. I just wish there would be more.
It gives you all the basics you need to do small data analysis in a company
Please add more manipulations within basic data analysis using excel course
Very good introductory course. Wished there were more practice questions.
It's a very educative introductory lesson and I'm glad I took the course
A good refresh and some new learnings - easy to follow and to understand
Well organized introduction to Excel analysis. Well suited to beginners.
Excellent course to learn about data analysis for beginners. Thank you.

Good course, mainly the pivot tables and advanced tables were of value
I thought I knew better.good instructor and an important refinement.
a great course with the principal functions to use in the real life
Very helpful, even if you use Excel daily you can learn specific to
A nice course for begginers in excel which includes business data.
very good for basic intro but the quizzes were a little too easy.
Very good lectures, graded assignments are challenging however.
It would have been better to do more practical quizzes on Excel
i like the fact that there are practices to enhance my learning
Video lectures could have been more vivid related to the exams.
nice and easy course to brush up your introductory excel skills
Course was fantastic!Needs more assignment problem ststements.
Excellent Course! Very clear videos and good practice quizzes!
Would have gotten 5 Stars but the course was not in Excel 2016
A good refresher course for advanced level of Excel learning.
some final questions in tests were not clearly understandable
Quite basic course, useful first tips for those new to Excel.
I learned a lot! It would be more helpful with more practice.
Great course for someone who wants to get the gist of excel.
A great course with a very good explanation of all concepts.

First of all Question 2 on the Week 3 quiz is horseshit & while the instructors have not gotten back to me on that run-on paragraph of nonsense at least one other student seems to agree with me. I also threatened to call it out in my course review if it wasn't rewritten for clarity & I am an extremely petty person. Other than that this is an absolutely fantastic course for people with limited Excel experience like myself. The lectures are all good length and skills are build upon each other in a nice logical way. The quizzes (sans week 3 question 2 & a few other questions that could be rewritten for better clarity) are well designed & actually help with developing the skills instead of just asking you to regurgitate facts from the lectures.Not currently enrolled in the full specialization, but would consider coming back to it when I have more time.
Excellent Course.  I have been using Excel for years and still learned some very useful skills here.  Most notable for me was the use of Pivot Charts and Tables, and the use of Excel Data Analysis tools to create histogram charts(which, up until now I did manually).  The section on VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP was also very useful.  The section on IF statements is well laid out in case you have not worked
Brief Course with very efficiently organized course material. The way of teaching was very good in simple way.A great course in MS Excel for beginners to have an in-depth knowledge with confidence.
A very well taught, comprehensive course on Excel, VLookups, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, etc, etc. I really enjoyed this course, and feel like I learnt a lot from taking it. The lectures were interesting, and the quizzes and course material was just right, not anywhere near overwhelming or difficult to understand.So from me to you, a big thank you !!!
Overall the course content and the way it is explained with right examples is making one to follow and understand the tools available in excel. It would be nice, if the course gives the option to choose the Excel version one has, so that it will be easy to quickly find the options being discussed
A good course for anyone looking for an introduction to using Excel for analysis. There is some help with navigation, but to be successful in this class it would be very helpful for a person to already be fairly familiar with the Excel ribbon and basic Excel navigation.
The course is very helpful to enter into Data Analysis starting Excel. I learned many new things to analyse data using excel and I am confident now to handle more data after this course. Whom so ever want to learn data analysis using excel must go for this course.
Everything was explained in detail, even the smallest bits we don't pay attention to. Beautifully designed course, I would recommend it to anyone looking to get started with excel and data analytics.
good course gives a basic foundation for data analytics ! Excellent for beginners who have no idea how to use excel for want to  learn systematically excel files given at every lecture are very useful.
Excellent class, well-written and presented with real-world examples that are challenging but not impossible to complete if you follow the small quizzes and stay on top of the deadlines. Great job!
This is amazing to see that i have completed the course with so much logical and analytical questions been answered. It is really valued a lot the course and lots of useful information to learn.
If you need a very basic introduction to Excel this would be a perfect course. Anyone who has little to no familiarity with pivot tables, lookup functions, and basic mathematics calculations would definitely benefit from the course. The instructor is very thorough. I consider myself an advanced user and found a few of the end-lesson testing questions to have a good level of challenge to them considering the lessons at hand. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone needing to learn Excel for data manipulation.
A very methodical and careful explanation of each stage involved in using MS Excel for basic data analysis in a business context. It is necessary that candidates look on the discussion forum, check the web, review the materials, and think carefully about the tasks in the weekly quizzes to pass. The support from the instructors was excellent: prompt and helpful. I am looking forward to taking the next stage. Thank you, Dr Sharad Borle and his team.
I would give 5 out of 5 without any hesitation. It is a wonderful course covering right from the basics to a moderate level, presenting the approaches to analyse the data. Good that Dr.Borle had presented tricky assignments for the course, that really helped us to use our brains and dig into the analysis. Much appreciated course. Thank you Dr.Borle and Coursera. Look forward to many more interesting courses on Data Analysis and Analytics.
The professor and the team has done a great job here!Excel sheets always looked and sounded like French and Greek to me until I took up this particular course, thanks to the efforts to the professor and his team!I will definitely recommend this course to my friends who are looking into taking their first steps towards Excel.Thanks for one such great, simple yet comprehensible course.
Excellent!!! Thanks a lot to all behind this course ( specially the course instructor Mr. Sharad Borle for his clear and to the point presentation) . Examples, Videos, Sub-Titles, Quiz and other contents really help the learner to be more adroit and practical. I would like to complete advanced courses and other upcoming courses if possible. You guys deserve high rating, Kudos (y)
I use Excel constantly at work, but I have frequently gotten information from it the hard way.  This course helped me increase my knowledge in some Excel functions that I knew about, but wasn't getting the most out of, such as Pivot Tables.  I have already applied what I learned in this course at work and THAT is about the best that you can hope for from a class.
This course helped reinforce some of the excel data analysis I learned during my MBA statistics class. The most useful content for me was vlookup and pivot tables. I realize the importance of applying the learning immediately in order to master the skills learned in this course. I look forward to taking the next course in the series!
Very good introduction to approach data analysis with Excel. The author of this MOOC gives an efficient method of using Excel sorting and processing functionalities, using files-scenarios close to real situations.
On the other hand, I would have liked the quality of the videos to be better and sharper.
Thank you for this course.
I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn advanced excel functions.  The module is easy to understand and the videos are so helpful.  Also you'll have a good teacher so it adds to the fun part of studying.  It is definitely a must for people who would want to expand their existing knowledge of excel.
For someone who is very unfamiliar with Excel and Data Analysis, this course really help me to understand the concept of each functions which are useful for data analysis. The explanation and curriculum is packed and clear, so for someone who's full time worker, it does help them to learn new things effectively and efficiently.
I took this as part of the specialization, so this review applies to the whole 5-course specialization. In this specific course, I learned some useful Excel problem-solving tips and functions here. It didn't go into too much detail on formatting and some other functions, since I think its intended to set you up for statistics specifically, but it was an excellent class nonetheless. The files and PowerPoint slides were well-done; for example, unlike some other Excel courses I've taken on Coursera, the PowerPoint slides are explanatory and clear, the text is big enough to be able to take screenshots of for note-taking purposes, and the quiz and test questions are clearly worded. Sharad also is a very good lecturer- engaging and doesn't rush through things; rather, he reminds you of things throughout the course, rather than just mentioning them once and then never explaining it again and assuming you remember it.
A good intro to people who are looking to learn excel and data analysis in general. The mini practice quizes are really nice to directly apply what you have learned in the video lessons. The weekly quizzes are of normal difficulty and everyone should be able to complete it by going over the video lessons. Other than that, this course is not that demanding and should fit nicely into your work/college schedules. Looking forward to more courses in the specialization.
I have been using Excel since my High School days, and hence am not new to the software. When I joined college, my usage grew, and along with it, my knowledge about the features of this software. However, I had just begun to scratch the surface of the capabilities of Excel, and this course taught me so much about the data analytics tools of Excel.
This course was helpful indeed. I got more knowledge on pivot tables, learnt how interactive pivot charts are and how to use them. Learnt how to group data, the right use of graphs and charts for proper visualization and lots more. Practiced severally for my grades and completed a mini project. I am always happy when I unlearn, learn and relearn.
The whole online course was a wonderful experience. Its easy and can become more perfect with the assignments. I thank Sharad Borle sir for explaining the course in an easy and perfect way. The assignments were helpful as they were an assurance that you got perfect with a topic. Cant wait to use it in my work! :)
Very good preliminary course. Covers fundamental topics in a clear and concise manner. Video lectures are easily understandable, and each lecture is followed by a practice quiz. The quizzes for each week are also well constructed and test the student's practical knowledge. Overall, very good introductory course.
This course has opened the door a crack to the powerful, and up to now mysterious, analytical tools available in Excel. I used the current version of Excel for MAC and had no difficulty translating the PC course material to my software.  I need to practice using these tools, but the fundamentals are there.
EVERYTHING WAS KNOWLEDGEABLE, BUT THERE WAS SOME LATENCY IN BETWEEN VIDEOS AS SPEAKER WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE AND VIDEO WAS ON SOME ANOTHER POINT. MOREOVER IN SUCH COURSES OF EXCEL IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY EXPLAINED ABOUT WHICH EXCEL THE LECTURE AS MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS ARE DIFFERENT IN XLS,10,13,16.MANY THANKS
Introduction to Data Analysis Using Excel is a fun fast paced course that will teach you practical knowledge in a short amount of time. All exercises were useful and to the point. I have no doubt, I'll be using what I learned in no time at all. Many thanks to Professor Sharad Borle, Rice and Coursera!
this is perfect course designed for excel beginners or intermediate learners. This gives idea of techniques for boosting ones productivity and complete data work in minimized time frame.instructors explains all tactics in lucid and simplified way to make learning process a fun and interactive.
Wonderful course...They have excellent teaching methodology.You cannot solve quizes without giving complete concentration on it which really gives you practicle insight to this course.It was my first course on coursera and I have made my mind to start another as early as possible.
THE best course I have pursued in a long time in terms of making hard to understand concepts easily comprehensible through a hands on approach and crisp, lucid lectures. Strongly recommended for students and managers  desirous of a firm foundation in Excel and Statistics.
I thought this course was straightforward and I felt that watching the professor go through the steps of performing different functions and creating different charts was a wonderful way to watch and learn. I felt the quizzes really tested my ability to apply the knowledge
Fantastic content. Learning to streamline and visualize data is useful for everybody. The additional knowledge on importing and managing data has given me an insight into the power of excel. I highly recommend this course to anybody, even fresh graduates/students.
Very well laid out course, concise, yet very informative.  I consider myself high intermediate at Excel and use it a lot on the job, but I still learned plenty and shored up some gaps in my knowledge.  I highly recommend this for nearly all levels of proficiency.
Introduction to Data Analysis Using Excel was my second online course through Coursera. It really helped me in clarifying my doubts and increase my learning in data analysis. My favorite and most challenging  topic of the course was VLOOKUP and Pivot Table.
Videos were particularly well crafted and made with obvious care. Lecturer spoke slowly, understandably to specific examples. Downloadable link to the exact excel sheet the professor is using is provided. Learned a few shortcuts I didn't know existed.
Am happy to have completed this course because it has really helped me in achieving my goals and learning new skills in modifying my data to the extend of producing the expected results as a data analyst you have brilliant instructors..Thank you.
Good course for the basics, learned a lot about pivot tables and I am excited to apply it to my projects.Some comments on the quizzes;1) Week 1 Graded Quiz there was a question on the unit price of the last row, which I got wrong. I am pretty sure the answer is correct. Would love feedback on this.2) Week 2 Graded Quiz there was a question on the quantity of orders made in one quarter but shipped in the next. I found some orders made in Q4 but received in Q1, so this might not make much sense. Also I got this wrong, and I think that it should be right (add up three numbers from the pivot table). Would also love feedback on this.Thank you Dr. Borle and team for the great course!
Very good course. Very good instructor! I learnt so much stuff in only a short time. The talking speed of the instructor was very good for me. Some people wrote that the instructor´s english is sometimes hard to understand since he is not native english speaker, but for me (I am german) his english was very easy to understand. I had no difficulties to understand him at all. It was even easier for me to understand him than my other (native english speaking) instructors in my other coursera courses. What I liked a lot was that he repeated important learning steps several times. This helped me to keep things in mind and recall them faster.
The course is really great. In that, the contents are well organized and are explained quite well. Every video lecture is well thought out beforehand and the video lecture lengths are as small as possible while making sure to get the topic across with optimum effort on both the instructor's as well as the students' side. The only issue I had was the lack of audio volume in every lecture. I think only  I might have had this issue. The instructor wasn't audible unless I turned off noisy appliances in my room and put on headphones on a 100% volume. I hope this gets fixed.
This course was very useful for me to understand how we can visualise , analyse and showcase business data so that some meaningful assumptions and inferences can be derived out for decision making. The course instructions also were simple to understand and infact i had taken up another course from another popular app based learning platform but was constantly comparing the teaching style of this course and the other course. I found this team style by the instructor from Rice , very easy and very methodical and thought that this course was superior.
Excellent course. One thing that really stands out about this course is the organization and great instruction. Also the tests really make you have to think. It is not like the majority of online courses I have taken where you have a bunch of multiple choice answers and you can essentially just make guesses until you arrive at the correct answer. In this course you truly have to understand the material to arrive at the correct answers. This is definitely one of  the best courses I have taken so far.
This is the first time I have taken any online course using excel although I have some experience in using excel and data analysis. It is a great honor for me that I have learnt many news things that I never knew before. I appreciate the efforts taken by BISP Pakistan for enhancing skills by providing such plate form. I will extend my gratitude to the RICE University faculty for providing such an amazing teaching methods and making us understand all the contents concisely and practically.
A very easy to understand and simple step by step process in making anyone understand the importance and use of excel in playing a huge role in business. Not only does the excel teach you to interpret data but you can also analyse the data to see any trends and improve them. I would say it made me understand the important role excel plays in running a business and how people need to understand the practical applicability of excel in day to day business life. Great job done, thank you!!
Very informational and well-paced course. Really enjoyed watching the videos, practicing on the downloadable worksheets and challenging the quizzes. The lecturer, Mr Sharad, is wonderful in his explanations. I'm interested to enroll in his other courses as I find his lessons easy to follow. One thing I had difficulty with though was understanding some of the quiz questions as they were worded ambiguously. Hope that can be improved on. Thank you!
Overall pleased with the content of this course. Most of the content was something you might already be familiar with, I was. You will be introduced to the Data Analysis Toolkit in Excel. And anyway, to complete the entire specialisation is the goal. Prof Borle's delivery was on point (would suggest you watch on 2x). The only complain is that the audio is supressed. You wont be able to hear distinctly without headphones or external speakers.
My college offered Excel, but it was stopped midway. But this course helped to pick up from where I stopped and go even further than what would have been taught at my college.The videos were well done, and easily understandable, Though the questions were sometimes tricky. This is my first online course I have ever completed, and I'm really satisfied with the course.If you want to learn excel, this is the right course for you.
This course is great! While i primarily came to learn VLookup & Pivot Tables, i learnt much more incl. scatter plots and histograms. Also the professor's step by step instructions is simply awesome. The exercises and tests were great too - some questions really challenge you! This is great course for someone who know basic excel and wants to take his/ her skills a notch higher. Thank you Rice University & Coursera.
It was a nice experience to going through the course. Though I usually use many formulas taught in this course but it helped me to get alternate method to apply the same. Moreover, in Pivot I got to know may other stuffs which I was not aware of. Overall, this course will definitely help me to carry out my excel task in a better way, specially in my job where I need to do a lot of analysis.
I love this course and the instructor. Great speaking voice, very clear and pleasant to listen to (very important).I went through all the study examples and although some things were a bit above my head, I learned a lot. I was able to complete all the homework and now I'm determined to learn Excel and will take the course over again.Thank you. Coursera
This course provided some basic insights on Microsoft Excel including the pivot table, pivot chart, histogram etc. One who's completely new to Excel can enroll in this course and learn a lot. The quiz questions were very much up to the mark and one really needs to understand each lesson clearly to answer those questions. Overall, it was a nice course!
The course is a good intro to basic data analysis. Power Pivot is touched on and basic but essential charting methods are also explained (I had not used these for some time so it was a welcome refresher). Overall it was an enjoyable experience and if you are a intermediate level user of Excel you should be able to complete the course rather quickly.
Excellent course for student wants to learn how to use data available and interpret them into useful information. At the same time, you learn how to use some of MS Excel functionality and features. The presenter of the course had given a simple and clear explanation of the concept and principles of the statistical tools for data analysis.
I loved this course very very much. Very informative, and the instructor is amazing. He explained everything so crisp and in a easy to understand way. Many congratulations for the amazing course to the entire team and the Rice University. Please do come up with more courses like that, and if possible, free of cost. All the best.
This is an excellent course; however, it is challenging. I haven't used Excel or worked in finance for many years.  I found the need to go back and review the videos and transcripts many times. In addition, Professor Sharad Borle is excellent -- he makes it look so easy. I now have a much greater appreciate for data analysis.
AS for me , its pretty helpful for learning the excel basic knowledge, learner can download the material from sources and take the quiz. I'm not consecutive to study this course , sometime  it will cost me  a little bit time to review the previously content. If you wanna deeply study or get the certificate ,you need to paid.
I really enjoyed this course. The pace was very good, videos were clear and informative and tests helped me to memorise the lessons better. This course is a very good starting point for beginners when it comes to Excel and provided materials helped in constant working "side-by-side" with the professor. Thank you very much!
It was an amazing journey of learning & wisdom throughout this course. Course lecture videos were very crispy. Yes, but you must have basic proficiency in MS Excel before opting this course, if you have it, this course is fun for you. Mentor Sharad Borle was an great instructor for this course. Thanks #RICE UNIVERSITY.
This course is very helpful for every student. if I talk about my self so I learned so many things which I never learned before. Sharad you are one of the great instructors of Excel. I will recommend this course to my friend. Course Content was good and Exam and Quiz were tough but very helpful. Thanks - Sharad Borle
Cource is dedicated to those who are not familiar with Excel and provides a good overview on most commonly used Excel features for data analysis. Good audio and video quality, nice examples of data, a little bit tricky assessments and systemic explanation of the teacher  results in my satisfation about this cource.
I like the course, but apparently I am lacking the correct Version of Excel. My German 2010 version does not import all data correctly. There is no conversion of dates and amounts. I used also Libre Office, but in vain. Currently I don´t have the funds to upgrade. So I withdraw from the course.Thanks
Very Good Course,The Course is very well organised and will help you in Practically learning and applying everything taught in the lectures.Lectures are interesting , I have completed this course within 4 days and now i have a good command in  implementing Excel in various Assignments and tasks
I \t is an excellent course by Sharad Sir.He is an dynamaic person.I got more than my expectation through this course.Before the course I was not comfortable with excel but due to his dynamic content now I atleast know how to deal with excel.All credit goes to Sharad Sir and Rice University.
This is the excellent course for getting the initial level understanding of Data Analysis. Many of my knowledge areas have been revised and refreshed. Also many things i have learnt new in this course. Really recommend it to all those who want to grab initial understanding of Data Analysis.
It was a beautiful experience here. Coursera helped me financially by giving this course for free. I kept in mind the terms and conditions. Sharad Borle is an amazing teacher, the way he teaches is just so good that everything is easy and understandable. Thankyou again for this opportunity.
This is an excellent course, and thak you for the extra time to finish it, for me a little longer because I have to traslate into my language and there are some  things tha I did not handle, from English to Excel, The way the teacher explained y very goodThank you so much, Mr Borle
Awesome and easy course! A must for the beginners or for a quick revision. I completed this 4 weeks course in 4 days..  I know 4 days are alot more of a time but i hardly studies for 3 hours per day.. Great course.. looking forward for other courses as well in this specialization.
Thank you, Dr. Sharad Borle!  Very helpful class!  A lot of useful information in the lectures, and the quizzes are very helpful to test your knowledge.  I have use Mac for this class, and I sometimes struggled to figure out some things, so I recommend to use Windows if you can.
it is really a good course for beginners to learn data analysis using excel. The course content is very well selected and organized. The instructor's grip over the subject is really good. The end of the Week assignments are also well designed to further practice what you learn.
Great course. I highly recommend following along with the videos and doing the same on your excel sheet. TO THE MAKERS: I would suggest making the excel files used in the example videos available so I could practice alongside the video. OVERALL GOOD COURSE AND VERY HELPFUL.
The content of the course is good. The instructor ensured that the session is not only about grasping theories rather getting into practical by actually getting hands-on experience. I find it worth completing this course and will carry forward my learning to explore more.
This course was truly challenging for me as someone who has very limited knowledge of excel.  I took several of the quizzes/final test over and over again until I got it right and fully understood what I was doing.  This Data Analysis Introduction was definitely helpful!
Indeed a very educational and interactive course. I have gotten a lot of learning out of this course and the organisation of the video lessons are phenomenal. However, it is very difficult to complete some of the assignments on a MacBook- however it is not impossible.
The course was very interesting. i was able to replay the videos and understand the concepts better based on the use of the examples the lecturer applied to each concept. for the most part the quizzes were based exactly on the concepts brought out in the lectures
A very useful course, I found lots of new and important staff to learn and can implement them all within my day-to-day tasks. I am expecting a huge difference after participation of this course into my statistical skills, thanks for the organizers of this course.
The course offers an astonishing chance to
develop myself in the area of data analysis! Actually, I can learn anything i
want from the world's greatest minds. This is a brand new way of learning new
things. Inspired by the way of learning in foreign university!!
This Course is very important one and is essential for everyone who is willing to do Data analysis in Excel. It really met my expectations. Many thanks goes to Rice University,  Coursera & Somaliland's Ministry of Employment Social Affairs & Family.
Great course that teaches you a lot of the basics in Excel. The instructor is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and explains the material in a clear way. I am now using much of the stuff that I learned in this course during my daily work.
Really well put together course and i love how much information is packed in small videos.The best thing about the course is the assignments can be really tricky even if they seem simple and it challenges you to think.Highly recommend this course.
It was a well crafted course, Videos & Study material was to the point. Course contents will be helpful in handling large database in very efficient manner. Instructors mastery over the subject  & teaching skills are really appreciable. Thanks !!!
Many factors made me narrow down to this course.1 Time Constraint2 Layman Friendly3 Problem Sets4 Easy to UnderstandEventhough I had some experience in Excel data analysis, I learnt some extra content which I think will definitely help my career.
This course is so interesting and encouraging for those interested in starting a career in Data Analysis. The instructors, videos, tutorials, assessments and group discussion forums are exceptional. I will recommend this course any day, any time
I loved the course. It was explained in a very simplified and interesting manner. It kept me engaged and cleared my concepts. The Practice quizzes and questions were really helpful in determining my concepts and understanding of the concepts.
One of the best courses on Data Analysis. Thank you Rice University and Sharad Borle Sir for providing such a valuable course and for great explanations. The Weekly quiz are very well designed to test your understanding of the video lessons.
This course guides you step-by-step from the basics, so it is for everyone who wants to learn Excel without minimum skills. Moreover, the video and quizzes help to review the materials. Overall, the course is amazing and timely managed.
This course was a good basic introduction to some useful tools in Excel. The most useful tool I learned was the VLOOKUP function and pivot tables. Will definitely be employable for any career requiring simple to complex data analysis.
Superb learning experience.If there is an advanced course to this would definitely love to do it .Very good faculty support staff and very enthusiastic fellow students whose guidance and thought process gives a different perspective.
Solid introduction to Excel. If you are brand new to Excel, you will likely need to practice a bit and/or refer to other resources for additional skills. Even though I've been using Excel for years, I still learned some new things.
Good for beginners, although a bit complicated to get around all the language barriers in Excel and without using the ToolPak which doesn't seem to work for my Excel. I'd recommend having google nearby throughout the course. Good
The course is really a good course. The instructor too is good at instructing.I enjoyed learning the course and I am sure that with what I have learned I would advanced in my career and personal development. Thank you Coursera.
Very useful but not necessarily a course for beginners. Understanding the concepts isn't tough because they are explained very well but the exercises can be challenging for people who don't have a functional knowledge of excel.
"I've never completed a course like this before and I cannot express how great the instructor was and the overall content of the material. I would Analysis Data . I will be looking into taking more of these course. Thank you!"
The course content is very good, the questions at the end of each week are also very testing, which gives the learner confidence to test his/her own learning. The instructor's way of teaching will be clear to a layman as well.
The only thing I would like to add is to keep in mind that students may be using a Mac. Professor Sharad explained how to get the Data Analysis Icon from an HP, not a Mac. The class was informative and I enjoyed it.Thank you!
Exceptional course. Course load is a little less if you're familiar with Excel before, otherwise learning while doing is really easy. The assignments are very practical and interesting. Looking forward for the specialization.
A perfectly framed course,has perfect synchronization with the topic and graded quiz.The best part of thr course was ofcourse Sharad SIr and also graded quiz,it was really smart and required evaluative thinking.Thank you!!!!
Excellent course to learn the basics of Excel and how to use it for day to day problems of data analysis.In short  it is a complete package for learning excel to beginners as well as for those who know a little about excel.
Although the course content is really basic but it is really essential as a foundation to go for the advanced courses in Business Statistics using Excel. Very nice examples are being used to explain the utilities of excel.
This course is one of the best that I've taken so far. I've always had a hard time navigating and using Excel due to its complexity. The course gave me (some) the necessary skills that I needed for my studies as a student.
I wish I had received a training like this when I first started working as an analyst 7 years ago. Although I was familiar with the concepts discussed, it was still useful to have them laid out in such a structured manner.
I really like the pacing of this course and of each video segment. The pace made it easy to follow along with the professor. I also appreciate that he doesn't use many shortcuts, and the few he uses, are used consistently
Excellent Course ! The instructors were awesome and explained even the hardest of topics with ease and in easy to understand language. Five stars and kudos to the whole team who took part in the creation of this course.
I was think the course is more complicated. When I have experience in Excel, I didn't have difficult for completed the course in few hours. But I think the others courses of the specialization can be more useful for me.
I underrated Excel all this while but finishing this course has washed away that misconception. So many of my day to day tasks have become super easy now. Glad that I could also help my Uncle because of learning Excel.
One of the best Coursera courses I have ever taken. You really learn to master some tools from the foundations to the advanced topics. Excellent non-trivial quizzes at the end of each week help you improve your skills
the assignments were challenging and good. The assignments is very helpful in learning it helped me to go back to some videos and refresh my memory about some complex concepts. Overall a very good and helpful course.
Complete approach of basic skills and tools. Capable educator. Suitable for users who already grasp basic functions of excel and fundamental notions of mathematics and analytical thinking.Thank you for the course!
